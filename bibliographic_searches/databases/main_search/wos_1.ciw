TI A review on per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) in
   microplastic and food-contact materials
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Plastic, paper and cardboard are widely used as food contact materials (FCMs), due to its numerous favourable characteristics. However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil-and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs.

TI How to investigate human health effects related to exposure to mixtures
   of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: A systematic review of
   statistical methods
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Humans are exposed to several per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health.
   Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect.
   Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers.
   Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures' effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16).
   Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted.

TI Activated carbon versus metal-organic frameworks: A review of their PFAS
   adsorption performance
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of fluorinated aliphatic compounds considered as emerging persistent pollutants. Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents.

TI Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water and wastewater: A critical
   review of their global occurrence and distribution
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of fluorinated organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L-1-mu g L-1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out-they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure-they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS.

TI The environmental distribution and removal of emerging pollutants,
   highlighting the importance of using microbes as a potential degrader: A
   review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Emerging pollutants (EPs) create a worldwide concern owing to their low concentration and severe toxicity to the receptors. The prominent emerging pollutants categories as pharmaceutical and personal care product, plasticizer, surfactants, and persistent organic pollutants. Typically, EPs are widely disseminated in the aquatic ecosystem and capable of perturbing the physiology of water bodies as well as humans. The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs. Overall, this review article illustrates the superiority of using non-cultivable and cultivable microbes to degrade the EPs as an eco-friendly approach. Practically, the outcomes of this review paper will build up the knowledge base solutions to remove EPs from the wastewater.

TI Recent advances in attached growth membrane bioreactor systems for
   wastewater treatment
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB To tackle membrane fouling and limited removals of pollutants (nutrients and emerging pollutants) that hinder the wide applications of membrane bioreactor (MBR), attached growth MBR (AGMBR) combining MBR and attached growth process has been developed. This review comprehensively presents the up-to-date developments of media used in both aerobic and anaerobic AGMBRs for treating wastewaters containing conventional and emerging pollutants. It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs.

TI Low-dose perfluorooctanoic acid stimulates steroid hormone synthesis in
   Leydig cells: Integrated proteomics and metabolomics evidence
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the well-known perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), has been widespread in the environment and associated with male reproductive toxicity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure.

TI A sensitive environmental forensic method that determines bisphenol S
   and A exposure within receipt-handling through fingerprint analysis
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB As human beings have been consistently exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) derived from various products, the intake of BPS/BPA to humans has been extensively studied. However, using conventional biological matrices such as urine, blood, or dissected skin to detect BPS/BPA in the human body system requires longer exposure time to them, hardly defines the pollutant source of the accumulated BPS/BPA, and is often invasive. Herein, our new approach i.e. fingerprint analysis quantitatively confirms the transfer of BPS/BPA from receipts (specific pollution source) to human skin only within receipt-handling of "20 s". When receipts (fingertip region size; similar to 1 cm(2)) containing 100-300 mu g of BPS or BPA are handled, 20-40 mu g fingerprint(-1) of BPS or BPA is transferred to human skin (fingertip). This transferred amount of BPS/BPA can still be toxic according to the toxicity test using water fleas. As a visual evidence, a fingerprint map that matches the distribution of the absorbed BPS/BPA is developed using a mass spectrometry imaging tool. This is the first study to analyze fingerprints to determine the incorporation mechanism of emerging pollutants. This study provides an efficient and non-invasive environmental forensic tool to analyze amounts and sources of hazardous substances.

TI Nano/Microplastics Capture and Degradation by Autonomous
   Nano/Microrobots: A Perspective
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The growing use of plastic materials has led to the continuous accumulation of wastes in marine environments, which fragment into hazardous micro-and nanoplastics. These plastic particles absorb toxic organic pollutants on their surface, support bacterial biofilms growth, and propagate through the food chain, posing serious risks for human health. Therefore, nano/microplastics pollution has become a global issue, making their definitive elimination compulsory. Self-propelled nano/microrobots have demonstrated efficient removal of nano/microplastics from water, combining enhanced physicochemical properties of nano/microscale materials and active motion. During the last year, the potential of this technology to degrade nano/microplastics has been investigated. Here, the most advanced strategies for nano/microplastics capture and subsequent degradation by autonomous nano/microrobots are critically reviewed. A short introduction to the main propulsion mechanisms and experimental techniques for studying nano/microplastics degradation is also provided. Forthcoming challenges in this research field are discussed proactively. This perspective inspires future nano/microrobotic designs and approaches for water purification from nano/microplastics and other emerging pollutants.

TI Impact of Contaminants on Microbiota: Linking the Gut-Brain Axis with
   Neurotoxicity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut-brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota-gut-brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity.

TI Membrane polarization in non-neuronal cells as a potential mechanism of
   metabolic disruption by depolarizing insecticides
SO FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB A significant rise in the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has occurred worldwide in the last two decades. Concurrently, a growing body of evidence suggests a connection between exposure to environmental pollutants, particularly insecticides, and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes key evidence of (1) the presence of different types of neuronal receptors - target sites for neurotoxic insecticides - in non-neuronal cells, (2) the activation of these receptors in non-neuronal cells by membrane-depolarizing insecticides, and (3) changes in metabolic functions, including lipid and glucose accumulation, associated with changes in membrane potential. Based on these findings, we propose that changes in membrane potential (V-mem) by certain insecticides serve as a novel regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism in non-excitable cells associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

TI Detection and treatment strategies of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS): Fate of PFAS through DPSIR framework analysis
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), regarded as "forever chemicals", are a class of emerging contaminants occurring worldwide that pose many serious environmental issues to water quality and human health. The presence of strong carbon-fluorine bonds in their backbone and their physicochemical properties offer them resistance and restrict them from breaking down into simple compounds in the environment. There are many challenges to be addressed in the detection and removal from the environment. In this comprehensive review, a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been proposed to understand PFAS from the source of emission and their impacts on the environment. We reviewed the various detection methodologies for monitoring PFAS levels and analytical techniques for their quantification to know their environmental levels. The challenges and scope of various treatment technologies developed and implemented have also been critically discussed. The future perspectives of PFAS, including their source reduction and framing regulatory policies and the challenges faced when moving towards a sustainable future, are focused.

TI A state-of-the-art review on producing engineered biochar from shellfish
   waste and its application in aquaculture wastewater treatment
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Global production of shellfish aquaculture is steadily increasing owing to the growing market demands for shellfish. The intensification of shellfish aquaculture to maximize production rate has led to increased generation of aquaculture waste streams, particularly the effluents and shellfish wastes. If not effectively managed, these wastes could pose serious threats to human health and the ecosystem while compromising the overall sustain ability of the industry. The present work comprehensively reviews the source, composition, and environmental implications of shellfish wastes and aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, recent advancements in the valorization of shellfish wastes into value-added biochar via emerging thermochemical and modification techniques are scrutinized. The utilization of the produced biochar in removing emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater is also discussed. It was revealed that shellfish waste-derived biochar exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacities (300-1500 mg/g) compared to lignocellulose biochar (<200 mg/g). The shellfish waste-derived biochar can be effectively employed for the removal of various contaminants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Finally, future research priorities and challenges faced to improve the sustainability of the shellfish aquaculture industry to effectively support global food security are elaborated. This review envisages that future studies should focus on the biorefinery concept to extract more useful compounds (e.g., carotenoid, chitin) from shellfish wastes for promoting environmental-friendly aquaculture.

TI Metabolomics analysis of the 3D L-02 cell cultures revealing the key
   role of metabolism of amino acids in ameliorating hepatotoxicity of
   perfluorooctanoic acid
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB To simulate the real cell status and morphology in the living systems is substantial for using cell models to ad -dress the detrimental effects of toxic contaminants. In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 mu M PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 mu M PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 mu M PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spher-oids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathi-one (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, in-dicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be ro-bust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants.

TI Bioremediation of perfluorochemicals: current state and the way forward
SO BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB Perfluorochemicals are widely found in the environment due to their versatile uses and persistent nature. Perfluorochemicals have also been detected in human and animals due to direct or indirect exposures, giving rise to health concerns. This review aims to examine the bioremediation of perfluorochemicals with plants, bacteria and fungi, including their efficiency and limitations. It also aims to propose the future prospects of bioremediation of perfluorochemicals. This review retrieved peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2021 from journal databases consisting of Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect. This review shows that multiple Pseudomonas species could degrade perfluorochemicals particularly perfluoroalkyl acids under aerobic condition. Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation. This review provides comprehensive insight into the efficiency of different bacterial, plant and fungal species in perfluorochemicals bioremediation under different conditions, their limitations and improvement.

TI Specific Metabolites Involved in Antioxidation and Mitochondrial
   Function Are Correlated With Frailty in Elderly Men
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB BackgroundAs an age-related syndrome, frailty may play a central role in poor health among older adults. Sarcopenia overlaps with the physical domain of frailty, and most existing studies have analyzed the associated factors of frailty and sarcopenia as an isolated state. Perturbations in metabolism may play an important role in the presence of frailty or sarcopenia; however, the metabolites associated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines, as specific panels, are significantly correlated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia, to gain insight into potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms and to facilitate their management. MethodsWe applied a targeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach in serum samples from 246 Chinese older men (age 79.2 +/- 7.8 years) with frailty (n = 150), non-frailty (n = 96), frailty and sarcopenia (n = 52), non-frail and non-sarcopenic control (n = 85). Frailty was evaluated using Freid phenotype criteria, sarcopenia was defined by diagnostic algorithm of Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the participants were diagnosed as frailty and sarcopenia when they met the evaluation criteria of both frailty and sarcopenia. A panel of 29 metabolomic profiles was assayed and included different classes of amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to screen the metabolic factors contributing to frailty status, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore important factors and distinguish different groups. ResultsIn older men demonstrating the frail phenotype, amino acid perturbations included lower tryptophan and higher glycine levels. With regard to lipid metabolism, the frailty phenotype was characterized by lower concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine (C5), LPC16:0 and LPC18:2, while higher levels of octanoyl-L-carnitine (C8), decanoyl-L-carnitine (C10), dodecanoyl-L-carnitine (C12) and tetradecanoyl-L-carnitine (C14). After adjusting for several clinical confounders, tryptophan, LPC18:2, LPC 16:0 and C5 were negatively correlated with frailty, and C8 and C12 were positively related to frailty. We preliminarily identified metabolic profiles (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, glycine and tryptophan) that may distinguish older men with frailty from those without frailty. Importantly, a set of serum amino acids and LPCs (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, and tryptophan) was characterized in the metabotype of older adults with an overlap of frailty and sarcopenia. The metabolites that were most discriminating of frailty status implied that the underlying mechanism might be involved in antioxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. ConclusionsThese present metabolic analyses may provide valuable information on the potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms of frailty, and overlapping sarcopenia. The findings obtained may offer insight into their management in older adults.

TI EDC-induced mechanisms of immunotoxicity: a systematic review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to a group of chemicals that cause adverse effects in human health, impairing hormone production and regulation, resulting in alteration of homeostasis, reproductive, and developmental, and immune system impairments. The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment.

TI Anaerobic Microbial Dechlorination of 6:2 Chlorinated Polyfluorooctane
   Ether Sulfonate and the Underlying Mechanisms
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The microbial transformation potential of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) was explored in anaerobic microbial systems. Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments.

TI Recent Advancements in Polysulfone Based Membranes for Fuel Cell
   (PEMFCs, DMFCs and AMFCs) Applications: A Critical Review
SO POLYMERS
AB In recent years, ion electrolyte membranes (IEMs) preparation and properties have attracted fabulous attention in fuel cell usages owing to its high ionic conductivity and chemical resistance. Currently, perfluorinatedsulfonicacid (PFSA) membrane has been widely employed in the membrane industry in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, Nafion(TM) suffers reduced proton conductivity at a higher temperature, requiring noble metal catalyst (Pt, Ru, and Pt-Ru), and catalyst poisoning by CO. Non-fluorinated polymers are a promising substitute. Polysulfone (PSU) is an aromatic polymer with excellent characteristics that have attracted membrane scientists in recent years. The present review provides an up-to-date development of PSU based electrolyte membranes and its composites for PEMFCs, alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) application. Various fillers encapsulated in the PEM/AEM moiety are appraised according to their preliminary characteristics and their plausible outcome on PEMFC/DMFC/AMFC. The key issues associated with enhancing the ionic conductivity and chemical stability have been elucidated as well. Furthermore, this review addresses the current tasks, and forthcoming directions are briefly summarized of PEM/AEMs for PEMFCs, DMFCs, AMFCs.

TI Genomic Characterization of Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov., a
   Biofilm-Forming Fungus Isolated from Mars 2020 Assembly Facility
SO JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB A fungal strain (FJII-L10-SW-P1) was isolated from the Mars 2020 spacecraft assembly facility and exhibited biofilm formation on spacecraft-qualified Teflon surfaces. The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis.

TI Different Metabolomic and Proteomic Profiles of Cerebrospinal Fluid in
   Ventricular and Lumbar Compartments in Relation to Leptomeningeal
   Metastases
SO METABOLITES
AB The different molecular profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between ventricular and lumbar compartments remain elusive, especially in the context of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), which affects CSF flow. We evaluated CSF metabolomic and proteomic profiles based on the compartments and the diagnosis of spinal LM, proved by MRI from 20 paired ventricular and lumbar CSF samples of LM patients, including 12 spinal LM (+) samples. In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified-7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (-) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (-) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment.

SO MEMBRANES
AB This paper presents a comprehensive literature review surveying the most important polymer materials used for electrospinning processes and applied as membranes for the removal of emerging pollutants. Two types of processes integrate these membrane types: separation processes, where electrospun polymers act as a support for thin film composites (TFC), and adsorption as single or coupled processes (photo-catalysis, advanced oxidation, electrochemical), where a functionalization step is essential for the electrospun polymer to improve its properties. Emerging pollutants (EPs) released in the environment can be efficiently removed from water systems using electrospun membranes. The relevant results regarding removal efficiency, adsorption capacity, and the size and porosity of the membranes and fibers used for different EPs are described in detail.

TI Integrative omics analysis reveals the protective role of vitamin C on
   perfluorooctanoic acid-induced hepatoxicity
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH
AB Introduction: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a compound used as an industrial surfactant in chemical processes worldwide. Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems.
   Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification.
   Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C.
   Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver.
   Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Cairo University.

TI Mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes of
   patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure
SO JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
AB Background & Aims: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) present a systemic hyperinflammatory response associated with increased circulating levels of small-molecule metabolites. To investigate whether these alterations reflect inadequate cell energy output, we assessed mitochondrial morphology and central metabolic pathways with emphasis on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in peripheral leukocytes from patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis, with and without ACLF.
   Methods: The study included samples from patients with AD cirrhosis (108 without and 128 with ACLF) and 41 healthy individuals. Leukocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy and cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic fluxes were determined by assessing NADH/FADH(2) production from various substrates. Plasma GDF15 and FGF21 were determined by Luminex and acylcarnitines by LCMS/MS. Gene expression was analyzed by RNA-sequencing and PCR-based glucose metabolism profiler array.
   Results: Mitochondrial ultrastructure in patients with advanced cirrhosis was distinguished by cristae rarefication and swelling. The number of mitochondria per leukocyte was higher in patients, accompanied by a reduction in their size. Increased FGF21 and C6:0-and C8:0-carnitine predicted mortality whereas GDF15 strongly correlated with a gene set signature related to leukocyte activation. Metabolic flux analyses revealed increased energy production in mononuclear leukocytes from patients with preferential involvement of extra-mitochondrial pathways, supported by upregulated expression of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. In patients with ACLF, mitochondrial function analysis uncovered break-points in the TCA cycle at the isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase level, which were bridged by anaplerotic reactions involving glutaminolysis and nucleoside metabolism.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence at the cellular, organelle and biochemical levels that severe mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes from patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF.
   Lay summary: Patients at advanced stages of liver disease have dismal prognosis due to vital organ failures and the lack of treatment options. In this study, we report that the functioning of mitochondria, which are known as the cell powerhouse, is severely impaired in leukocytes of these patients, probably as a consequence of intense inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore a hallmark of advanced liver disease. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by lsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association for the Study of the Liver.

TI Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure, maternal metabolomic
   perturbation, and fetal growth in African American women: A
   meet-in-the-middle approach
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Prenatal exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to reduced fetal growth. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia.
   Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8-14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship.
   Results: Each log(2)-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations.
   Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction.

TI PFAS exposure of humans, animals and the environment: Protocol of an
   evidence review map and bibliometric analysis
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances are a group of anthropogenic organic chemicals. PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the 'grey literature'. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by fulltext screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis.

TI Identification of partial denitrification granulation enhanced by low
   C/N ratio in the aspect of metabolomics and quorum sensing
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Partial denitrification granular sludge (PDGS) and denitrification granular sludge (DGS) play an important role in nitrogen removal from wastewater. However, the inherent cause of aggregation capacity related to the ratio of COD to nitrogen (COD/N) is still unclear. In this study, metabolomics analysis was combined with microbiological analyses, granular performance and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure to explore the granulation mechanism at different influent COD/N ratios. The results showed that the higher COD/N ratio selectively enhanced the gluconeogenesis pathway, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathway, resulting in more extracellular polysaccharide (PS) excretion and floc sludge. The absence of carbon source weakened tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) reaction, resulting in NAD+ and ADP decrease, nitrite accumulation and change of microbial community structure. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was enhanced under low COD/N ratio, which promoted the hydrophobicity of EPS. PDGS had stronger Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) than DGS during the operational period. CO8-HSL, C8-HSL and C6-HSL, as the main form of AHLs, played a dominating role in DGS and PDGS. Batch tests illustrated that adding AHLs obviously improved the synthesis of the amino acids, threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), methionine (Met) and glycine (Gly). Dosing AHLs regulated PS synthesis only at a high COD/N ratio. The glucose-6P, glycerate-3p and UDP-Glc were upregulated only in DSG, which increased the hydrophilic groups in EPS. The results not only provided the new insights into the metabolism of denitrifying granular sludge, but also indicated the application potential of the technologies regarding start-up and operation of granule sludge.

TI A review of environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals and effect
   biomarkers associating disease risks: Where exposomics meets
   metabolomics
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Humans are exposed to an ever-increasing number of environmental toxicants, some of which have gradually been elucidated to be important risk factors for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management.

TI Maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and preterm
   birth: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Preterm birth is the second most common cause of death in children under 5 years of age. The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth. In conclusion, maternal exposure to metals and phthalates may increase the risk for preterm birth based on current evidence.

TI Concentration profiles of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in major
   sources to the environment
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB A review of published literature was conducted to present the concentrations and composition profiles of per -and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from significant sources to the environment. The major sources of PFAS to the environment are categorized under direct and indirect sources. The characteristic compounds and concen-trations are summarized as found from direct sources such as manufacturing facilities, aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) applications, metal coating operations, and textile and paper coating operations; and from indi-rect sources such as landfills and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The major findings are: 1) among the aqueous matrices for which data were reviewed, groundwater impacted by AFFF contamination showed the highest median concentrations for both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), while the second-highest median concentrations were associated with landfill leachates for PFOA and metal-plating sources for PFOS; 2) many of the unknown polyfluorinated precursors present in AFFF-impacted sites could potentially convert to persistent PFAS by abiotic or biotic transformation, and therefore could act as the long-term source of contamination to the environment; 3) part per billion (ppb) concentrations of PFAS were detected in water bodies surrounding fluorochemical manufacturing plants; 4) in consumer products such as textile, paper, and personal care products, PFOA concentrations were an order of magnitude higher compared to other PFAS; 5) biotransformation products such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are detected in landfill leachates and WWTP effluents; and 6) many studies have shown increased PFAA concentrations in WWTP effluents compared to influents. This work provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the PFAS concentration and composition trends of select non-polymeric PFAS in different sources.

TI Multi-parameter risk assessment of forty-one selected substances with
   endocrine disruptive properties in surface waters worldwide
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB The increasing use of substances with endocrine disruptive properties (EDs) not only impacts aquatic organisms but can also have a direct negative effect on human health. In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018-2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research. A new prioritization system is therefore presented, which provides a potential basis for new substances to be included in environmental monitoring lists.

TI Exposure routes, bioaccumulation and toxic effects of per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) on plants: A critical review
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are artificial persistent organic pollutants ubiquitous in ecosystem, and their bioaccumulation and adverse outcomes in plants have attracted extensive concerns. Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and mu g/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming. Future challenges and opportunities in PFAS phytotoxicity studies are also proposed in the review.

TI Elevated levels of perfluoroalkyl substances in breast cancer patients
   within the Greater Manila Area
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Several studies have reported exposure of humans to various endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) worldwide. However, there is a lack of data regarding EDC exposures in humans living in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Hence, this study measured levels of 41 EDCs in women residing in the Greater Manila Area, home to the second largest city in Southeast Asia. Urine samples from women with versus without breast cancer were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites, 8 environmental phenols, and 10 bisphenols, while serum samples were analyzed for 12 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Out of the four groups of EDCs analyzed, PFAS were significantly associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR = 13.63, 95% CI: 3.24-94.88 p-trend = 0.001 for PFDoA; adjusted OR = 9.26, 95% CI 2.54-45.10, p-trend = 0.002 for PFDA; and adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 0.95-7.66, p-trend = 0.004 for PFHxA). Long-chain PFAS levels were positively correlated with age and were significantly higher in women from Region IV-A, a heavily industrialized region, than from the National Capital Region. Overall, this study showed baseline information regarding the level of EDCs in Filipinas, providing a glimpse of EDC exposure in women living in a megalopolis city in Southeast Asia.

TI PFAS fate and destruction mechanisms during thermal treatment: a
   comprehensive review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals and have been detected throughout the environment. Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.

TI The transplacental transfer efficiency of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS): a first meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS
AB Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure.

TI Which Micropollutants in Water Environments Deserve More Attention
   Globally?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as "micropollutants" due to their low concentrations, and longterm exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer.

TI Assessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer (PPL) solid-phase
   extraction and non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of
   xenobiotics in seawater
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
AB Anthropogenic imprints have become a fundamental part of most ecosystems. Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH similar to 8) than in acidified samples (pH similar to 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC-MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments.

TI Reactive High-Valent Iron Intermediates in Enhancing Treatment of Water
   by Ferrate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Efforts are being made to tune the reactivity of the tetraoxy anion of iron in the +6 oxidation state ((FeO42-)-O-VI), commonly called ferrate, to further enhance its applications in various environmental fields. This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43- (FeV) and (FeO44-)-O-IV or (FeO32-)-O-IV (Fe-IV) species, from (FeO42-)-O-VI, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and Fe-IV species from (FeO42-)-O-VI include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from (FeO42-)-O-VI via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by (FeO42-)-O-VI, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of Fe-V/Fe-IV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., Fe-IV and Fe-V) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing (FeO42-)-O-VI. Further mechanistic elucidation of activated ferrate systems is vital to achieve high efficiency in oxidizing emerging pollutants in various aqueous streams.

TI Algae bioprocess to deal with cosmetic chemical pollutants in natural
   ecosystems: A comprehensive review
SO JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB Elevated demand and extensive exploitation of cosmetics in day-to-day life have hiked up its industrial productions worldwide. Organic and inorganic chemicals like parabens, phthalates, sulfates, and so forth are being applied as constituents towards the formulations, which tend to be the mainspring ecological complication due to their enduring nature and accumulation properties in various sections of the ecosystem. These cosmetic chemicals get accrued into the terrestrial and aquatic systems on account of various anthropogenic activities involving agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and domestic effluents. Recently, the use of microbes for remediating persistent cosmetic chemicals has gained immense interest. Among different forms of the microbial community being applied as an environmental beneficiary, algae play a vital role in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by their biologically beneficial metabolites and molecules, resulting in the biobenign and efficacious consequences. The use of various bacterial, fungal, and higher plant species has been studied intensely for their bioremediation elements. The bioremediating property of the algal cells through biosorption, bioassimilation, biotransformation, and biodegradation has made it favorable for the removal of persistent and toxic pollutants from the environment. However, the research investigation concerned with the bioremediation potential of the algal kingdom is limited. This review summarizes and provides updated and comprehensive insights into the potential remediation capabilities of algal species against ecologically hazardous pollutants concerning cosmetic chemicals.

TI Exposure to GenX and its novel analogs disrupts fatty acid metabolism in
   male mice
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), including hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, GenX), have been widely used as alternatives to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and subsequently detected in various environmental matrices. Despite this, public information regarding their hepatotoxicity remains limited. Here, to compare the hepatotoxicity of PFECAs and identify better alternatives for GenX, adult male mice were exposed to different concentrations (0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg/d) of PFOA, GenX, and its analogs (PFMO2HpA and PFMO3NA) for 28 d. Results demonstrated increased hepatomegaly and disturbed fatty acid metabolism with increasing treatment doses. After dimensionality reduction analysis, significant differences were observed in the relative liver weights and liver and serum biochemical parameters among the four clusters. Furthermore, when chemical concentrations in the liver were similar, no differences in the indicators of liver injury associated with fatty acid metabolism were observed among groups in the same clusters. Our results suggest that dimensionality reduction analysis is a useful strategy for analyzing samples exposed to multiple compounds at different doses. Furthermore, PFECAs exhibit similar hepatotoxicities at the same cumulative hepatic concentration in mice with constant body weight, while PFMO2HpA exhibits lower hepatotoxicity compared to GenX at the same dose.

TI Treatment technologies to mitigate the harmful effects of recalcitrant
   fluoroquinolone antibiotics on the environ- ment and human health
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Antibiotic proliferation in the environment and their persistent nature is an issue of global concern as they induce antibiotic resistance threatening both human health and the ecosystem. Antibiotics have therefore been categorized as emerging pollutants. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics are an emerging class of contaminants that are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine. The recalcitrant nature of fluoroquinolones has led to their presence in wastewater, effluents and water bodies. Even at a low concentration, FQs can stimulate antibacterial resistance. The main sources of FQ contamination include waste from pharmaceutical manufacturing industries, hospitals and households that ultimately reaches the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The conventional WWTPs are unable to completely remove FQs due to their chemical stability. Therefore, the development and implementation of more efficient, economical, convenient treatment and removal technologies are needed to adequately address the issue. This review provides an overview of the technologies available for the removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics from wastewater including adsorptive removal, advanced oxidation processes, removal using non-carbon based nanomaterials, microbial degradation and enzymatic degradation. Each treatment technology is discussed on its merits and limitations and a comparative view is presented on the choice of an advanced treatment process for future studies and implementation. A discussion on the commercialization potential and eco-friendliness of each technology is also included in the review. The importance of metabolite identification and their residual toxicity determination has been emphasized. The last section of the review provides an overview of the policy interventions and regulatory frameworks that aid in retrofitting antibiotics as a central key focus contaminant and thereby defining the discharge limits for antibiotics and establishing safe manufacturing practices.

TI Emerging materials and technologies for landfill leachate treatment: A
   critical review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Sanitary landfill is the most popular way to dispose solid wastes with one major drawback: the generation of landfill leachate resulting from percolation of rainfall through exposed landfill areas or infiltration of groundwater into the landfill. The landfill leachate impacts on the environment has forced authorities to stipulate more stringent requirements for pollution control, generating the need for innovative technologies to eliminate waste degradation by-products incorporated in the leachate. Natural attenuation has no effect while conventional treatment processes are not capable of removing some the pollutants contained in the leachate which are reported to reach the natural environment, the aquatic food web, and the anthroposphere. This review critically evaluates the state-of-the-art engineered materials and technologies for the treatment of landfill leachate with the potential for real-scale application. The study outcomes confirmed that only a limited number of studies are available for providing new information about novel materials or technologies suitable for application in the removal of pollutants from landfill leachate. This paper focuses on the type of pollutants being removed, the process conditions and the outcomes reported in the literature. The emerging trends are also highlighted as well as the identification of current knowledge gaps and future research directions along with recommendations related to the application of available technologies for landfill leachate treatment.

TI Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Integrated Crop-Livestock
   Systems: Environmental Exposure and Human Health Risks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent synthetic organic contaminants that can cause serious human health concerns such as obesity, liver damage, kidney cancer, hypertension, immunotoxicity and other human health issues. Integrated crop-livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States. Although there is a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water by the U.S. EPA, there are not yet regional screening guidelines for conducting risk assessments of livestock watering as well as the soil and plant matrix. This systematic review includes (i) the sources, impacts and challenges of PFAS in integrated crop-livestock systems, (ii) safety measures and protocols for sampling soil, water and plants for determining PFAS concentration in exposed integrated crop-livestock systems and (iii) the assessment, measurement and evaluation of human health risks related to PFAS exposure.

TI "Non-invasive" portable laser ablation sampling for lead isotope
   analysis of archaeological silver: a comparison with bulk and in situ
   laser ablation techniques
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB The main factor restricting lead isotope analysis of metals from museum collections is the requirement for physical material. Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (+/- 2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

TI Emerging pollutants and their removal using visible-light responsive
   photocatalysis - A comprehensive review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Emerging pollutants (EP) are the group of contaminants newly detected in aquatic environments around the globe. Conventional water purification systems are less efficient in removing these pollutants; therefore, innovative, and eco-friendly technologies are needed. Recently, semiconductor-supported photocatalysis has attracted attention in environmental remediation for removing EP's owing to their unique characteristics of lowcost, higher thermal and mechanical stability, and excellent pollutant removal efficiency. The charge separation and effective light absorption, particularly in the visible region, are two essential characteristics in photocatalyst which are hard to achieve. Several approaches have been adopted to enhance the charge separation and lightabsorption ability in the visible range, including elemental-doping, morphology-engineering, and composite photocatalyst formation. This review concisely discusses the several recently discovered EP's, their fate and transport properties, as well as recent progress in the design and development of visible light-responsive photocatalysts for degradation of EP's. Furthermore, synthesis methods, key features such as optical properties, energy-bandgap structure, crystallinity, and surface features are emphasized in this review. The influencing process parameters, reusability, and stability of photocatalyst are also outlined. Finally, the summary and future perspectives for designing a sustainable photocatalysis system are presented.

TI Absorption separation of fluorinated refrigerant gases with ionic
   liquids: Equilibrium, mass transport, and process design
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Interest in recovering and reclaiming refrigerant gases is growing as a consequence of increasing concern about the high global warming potential of some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). However, advanced separation processes, like extractive distillation, are required to selectively separate azeotropic and close-boiling refrigerant mixtures. In this regard, ionic liquids (ILs) arise as promising entrainers because of their favorable properties, including nonvolatility and good HFC solubility selectivity. The aim of this review is to become a reference text for the research and design of novel separation processes for mixtures of fluorinated gases based on the use of ILs. We include an extensive compilation of publications on equilibrium, mass transport, and absorption and membrane separation related to the use of ILs to selectively separate, not only the most relevant refrigerants employed nowadays, namely, HFCs, hydrofluoroolefins, and hydrochlorofluoroolefins, but also other relevant refrigerant families, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. The UC-RAIL database provided as Supplementary Information compiles more than 5000 data points that are comprehensively analyzed in the review focusing on process design. Finally, we provide a set of directions that lead to the recovery of fluorinated refrigerant gases, to shift the refrigeration and air conditioning sector towards a more circular economy.

TI Probiotic intervention mitigates the metabolic disturbances of
   perfluorobutanesulfonate along the gut-liver axis of zebrafish
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB ABS T R A C T Probiotic supplementation is effective to modulate the metabolic disorders caused by perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To this end, the present study exposed adult zebrafish to PFBS (0 and 10 mu g/L), probiotics, or their binary combinations for 40 days. After the exposure, the nutritional stores, intestinal organization, and metabolic activities along the gut-liver axis were investigated. The results showed that PFBS exposure decreased the nutrient reserves significantly, especially the lipid content, which was alleviated by the probiotic administration. Intestinal mucus secretion was promoted remarkably in the presence of the probiotic, which enhanced epithelial protection against PFBS damage. Metagenomic analysis showed that PFBS alone induced gut microbial dysbiosis, which was efficiently antagonized by the probiotic bacteria. Intestinal metabolomic profiling revealed that ferroptosis occurred because of the unrestricted lipid peroxidation following PFBS exposure. However, probiotic administration prevented the ferroptotic symptoms induced by PFBS, further highlighting the beneficial effects of the probiotic on the host. In PFBS-exposed livers, high levels of bile acid metabolites (e.g., taurochenodeoxycholic acid) accumulated, implying the induction of cholestasis. Notably, probiotic addition recovered the metabolomic homeostasis under PFBS stress, probably resulting from the activation of detoxification pathways based on the pentose and glucuronate interconversion. Overall, the present study provides systematic evidence of the antagonistic interaction between PFBS and the probiotic regarding the metabolic activities along the microbe, gut and liver axis, highlighting the application values of probiotic recipe in aquaculture industry and ecological reservation.

TI Membrane-based technologies for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances
   (PFASs) removal from water: Removal mechanisms, applications, challenges
   and perspectives
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Water purification from per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), as a group of persistent and mobile fluoroorganic contaminants, is receiving increasing attention worldwide due to the ubiquitous presence of these highly toxic compounds. To reduce the risk of exposure of human life to PFASs and their dispersion in the environment, various techniques, primarily based on membrane technologies, have been rapidly developed. Here we critically review and analyze the current state-of-the-art of membrane-based techniques for PFASs removal, including direct membrane filtrations, adsorption-based membranes, and hybrid membrane processes. Membranes performance, treatment efficiencies, characteristic parameters and mechanisms for PFASs removal are discussed in detail. We highlight and discuss advantages and limitations, as well as challenges and prospects of individual membrane-based PFASs treatments, pointing towards the practical and sustainable application of these technologies.

TI Assessing exposure of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in car
   cabins: Current understanding and future challenges in developing a
   standardized methodology
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) can be found in air, dust and on surfaces in car cabins, leading to exposure to humans via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. This review aims at describing current understanding concerning sampling, levels, and human exposure of SVOCs from car cabin environments. To date, several different methods are used to sample SVOCs in car cabin air and dust and there are no standard operating procedures for sampling SVOCs in cars detailed in the literature. The meta-analysis of SVOCs in car cabin air and dust shows that brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been most frequently studied, primarily focusing on concentrations in dust. In dust, detected concentrations span over three to seven orders of magnitude, with highest median concentrations for OPFRs, followed by BFRs and, thereafter, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In air, the variation is smaller, spanning over one to three orders of magnitude, with phthalates and siloxanes having the highest median concentrations, followed by OPFRs, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and BFRs. Assessments of human exposures to SVOCs in cars have, so far, mainly focused on external exposure, most often only studying one exposure route, primarily via dust ingestion. In order to perform relevant and complete assessments of human exposure to SVOCs in cars, we suggest broadening the scope to which SVOCs should be studied, promoting more comprehensive external exposure assessments that consider exposure via all relevant exposure routes and making comparisons of external and internal exposure, in order to understand the importance of in-car exposure as a source of SVOC exposure. We also suggest a new sampling approach that includes sampling of SVOCs in both car cabin air and dust, aiming to reduce variability in data due to differences in sampling techniques and protocols.

TI Tooth biomarkers to characterize the temporal dynamics of the fetal and
   early-life exposome
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Teeth have unique histology that make this biomatrix a time-capsule for retrospective exposure analysis of fetal and early life. However, most analytic methods require pulverizing the whole tooth, which eliminates exposure timing information. Further, the range of chemicals and endogenous exposures that can be measured in teeth has yet to be fully characterized. Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomics on micro-dissected layers from naturally shed deciduous teeth. Using four liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry analytical modes, we profiled small molecules (<1000 Da) from prenatal and postnatal tooth fractions. In addition, we employed linear regression on the tooth fraction pairs from 31 children to identify metabolites that discriminate between prenatal and postnatal exposures. Results: Of over 10,000 features measured in teeth dentin, 390 unique compounds were annotated from 62 chemical classes. The class with the largest number of compounds was carboxylic acids and their derivatives (36%). Of the annotated exogenous metabolites (phthalates, parabens, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and cotinine) and endogenous metabolites (fatty acids, steroids, carnitines, amino acids, and others), 91 are linked to 256 health conditions through published literature. Differential analysis revealed 267 metabolites significantly different between the prenatal and the postnatal tooth fractions (adj. p-value < 0.05, Bonferroni correction), and 21 metabolites exclusive to the prenatal fraction. Conclusions: The prenatal and early postnatal exposome revealed from dental biomarkers represents a broad range of endogenous and exogenous metabolites for a comprehensive characterization in environmental health research. Most importantly, this technology provides a direct window into fetal exposures that is not possible by maternal biomarkers. Indeed, we identified several metabolites exclusively in the prenatal fraction, suggesting unique fetal exposures that are markedly different to postnatal exposures. Expansion of databases that include tooth matrix metabolites will strengthen biological interpretation and shed light on exposures during gestation and early life that may be causally linked with later health conditions.

TI Environmental occurrence and remediation of emerging organohalides: A
   review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB As replacements for "old" organohalides, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), "new" organohalides have been developed, including decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), and perfluorobutyrate (PFBA). In the past decade, these emerging organohalides (EOHs) have been extensively produced as industrial and consumer products, resulting in their widespread environmental distribution. This review comprehensively summarizes the environmental occurrence and remediation methods for typical EOHs. Based on the data collected from 2015 to 2021, these EOHs are widespread in both abiotic (e.g., dust, air, soil, sediment, and water) and biotic (e.g., bird, fish, and human serum) matrices. A significant positive correlation was found between the estimated annual production amounts of EOHs and their environmental contamination levels, suggesting the prohibition of both production and usage of EOHs as a critical pollution-source control strategy. The strengths and weaknesses, as well as the future prospects of up-to-date remediation techniques, such as photodegradation, chemical oxidation, and biodegradation, are critically discussed. Of these remediation techniques, microbial reductive dehalogenation represents a promising in situ remediation method for removal of EOHs, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs).

   metagenomics analysis
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, C6-HSL and C8-HSL were separately introduced into anammox biofilm reactors to facilitate the anammox performance at 15 degrees C. After operation 138 d, total nitrogen removal efficiencies in reactors with amendment C6-HSL or C8-HSL at 15 degrees C reached 76.2% and 74.6%, respectively. Content of extracellular polymeric substances increased by 19.8%, 67.7% and 121.2% in control group, C6-HSL and C8-HSL addition group, respectively. Genes associated with nitrogen removal (i.e., hzo, hzsB, nirS, and ccsB) showed higher expression level at amendment C6-HSL or C8-HSL group. Metagenomics analysis found that amendment of C6-HSL or C8-HL resulted in an increased abundance of genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and also genes associated with amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Overall, amendment C6HSL or C8-HSL had been confirmed as the effective method to improve the performance of anammox bioreactor at 15 degrees C.

TI Nanofiltration for drinking water treatment: a review
SO FRONTIERS OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In recent decades, nanofiltration (NF) is considered as a promising separation technique to produce drinking water from different types of water source. In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed the progress of NF-based drinking water treatment, through summarizing the development of materials/fabrication and applications of NF membranes in various scenarios including surface water treatment, groundwater treatment, water reuse, brackish water treatment, and point of use applications. We not only summarized the removal of target major pollutants (e.g., hardness, pathogen, and natural organic matter), but also paid attention to the removal of micropollutants of major concern (e.g., disinfection byproducts, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and arsenic). We highlighted that, for different applications, fit-for-purpose design is needed to improve the separation capability for target compounds of NF membranes in addition to their removal of salts. Outlook and perspectives on membrane fouling control, chlorine resistance, integrity, and selectivity are also discussed to provide potential insights for future development of high-efficiency NF membranes for stable and reliable drinking water treatment.

TI Unravelling the impacts of perfluorooctanoic acid on anaerobic sludge
   digestion process
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a type of persistent organic pollutant that has been detected in wastewater treatment systems, subsequently entering the waste activated sludge (WAS) anaerobic digesters. Nevertheless, how PFOA affects the anaerobic digestion of WAS has never been reported till now. In this study, a series of batch digesters were set up to assess the performance of the anaerobic sludge digestion processes with exposures to different levels of PFOA. Experimental results revealed that the increased PFOA concentration (3-60 mu g/g-TS) caused the 11.1-19.2% decrease in methane production than the control. Correspondingly, the relative abundances of several key microbes related to acidification (e.g., Longilinea sp.) and methanation (e.g., Methanosaeta sp.) decreased when exposed to PFOA, as demonstrated by microbial community analysis. Further investigations based on modelling and intermediate metabolites analysis confirmed the inhibition of acidification and methanation caused by PFOA, thus decreasing the methane production potential of WAS in anaerobic digestion.

TI Recent Advances in Sensor-Based Detection of Toxic Dyes for
   Bioremediation Application: a Review
SO APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Extensive use of these harmful dyes has resulted in the surplus presence of these emerging pollutants in the environment, thus demanding an instant and sensitive detection method. Various synthetic dyes are illegitimately mixed into food and other consuming items for displaying bright colours that attracts consumers. The synthetic dyes cause a number of environmental health hazards and promote toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in humans. Despite these serious health glitches, synthetic dyes are widely used due to their much lower cost. As a result, a faster, more selective and extremely sensitive technology for detecting and quantifying hazardous dyes in trace amount is urgently needed. This topic is currently in its initial phases of development and needs continuous refinements, such as explaining various sensing methods and potential future uses linked with dye detection technologies. The present review encompasses a comprehensive literature survey on detection of dyes and latest progress in developing sensors for dye detection and summarizes different detection mechanisms, including biosensor-, optical- and electrochemical-based sensors. Detection methodologies are examined with a focus on biosensor-based recent advancements in dye detection and the growing demand for more appropriate systems in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

TI Arthroplasty vs proximal femoral nails for unstable intertrochanteric
   femoral fractures in elderly patients: A systematic review and
   meta-analysis
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
AB BACKGROUND
   Proximal femoral nails (PFNs) are the most common method for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFFs), but postoperative bed rest is required. There is a large amount of blood loss during the operation. Osteoporosis in elderly patients may cause nonunion of fractures and other complications. Arthroplasty can give patients early weight bearing and reduce financial burden, but whether it can replace PFNs remains controversial.
   AIM
   To compare the clinical outcomes of arthroplasty and PFNs in the treatment of unstable IFFs in elderly patients.
   METHODS
   A search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases and included relevant articles comparing arthroplasty and PFN. The search time was limited from January 1, 2005 to November 1, 2020. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data and evaluated the quality according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the research results, the fixed effect model or random effect model were selected for analysis. The following outcomes were analyzed: Harris Hip score, mortality, complications, operation time, blood loos, hospital stay, weight-bearing time, fracture classification and type of anesthesia.
   RESULTS
   We analyzed four randomized controlled trials that met the requirements. A total of 298 patients were included in these studies. According to the AO/OTA classification, there are 20 A1 types, 136 A2 types, 42 A3 types and 100 unrecorded types. Primary outcome: The Harris Hip Score at the final follow-up of the PFN group was higher [mean difference (MD): 9.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 16.57 to 1.45), P = 0.02]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of overall mortality [risk ratio (RR): 1.44, P = 0.44] or the number of complications (RR: 0.77, P = 0.05). Secondary outcomes: blood loss of the arthroplasty group was higher (MD: 241.01, 95% CI: 43.06-438.96, P = 0.02); the operation time of the PFN group was shorter (MD: 23.12, 95%CI: 10.46-35.77, P = 0.0003); and the length of hospital stay of the arthroplasty group was shorter [MD: 0.97, 95% CI: 1.29 to 0.66), P < 0.00001]. There was no difference between the two groups in the type of anesthesia (RR: 0.99). There were only two studies recording the weight-bearing time, and the time of full weight bearing in the arthroplasty group was significantly earlier.
   CONCLUSION
   Compared with PFN, arthroplasty can achieve weight bearing earlier and shorten hospital stay, but it cannot achieve a better clinical outcome. Arthroplasty cannot replace PFNs in the treatment of unstable IFFs in elderly individuals.

TI Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and childhood
   obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis of human studies
SO OBESITY REVIEWS
AB We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and childhood obesity. We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I-2: 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I-2: 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses. In individual studies, there was inconclusive evidence that POP levels were positively associated with other obesity indicators (e.g., waist circumference).

SO CHEM
AB Due to the nonrenewable nature of coal and uncompetitive market value, developing advanced FTS techniques for industrialization remains one of the research frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis. In this review, we present a brief introduction of the reaction pathways that directly convert syngas to olefins/aromatics via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Based on the mechanism of olefin formation, four key factors controlling the nature of catalyst functions were reviewed, including active metal/phase, transition metal promoter, alkali promoter, and catalyst support, for improving olefins or aromatics selectivity, while the photocatalytic form as a novel reaction system is also introduced. In the last part, we discussed the challenges in improving product selectivity and catalyst stability, the strategy in catalyst design and catalytic system from a new perspective, the method for understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic performance, and the potential industrialization for FTO/FTA.

TI Remediation and mineralization processes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) in water: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic organic molecules used to manufacture various consumer and industrials products. In PFAS, the C\\F bond is stable, which renders these compounds chemically stable and prevents their breakdown. Several PFAS treatment processes such as adsorption, photolysis and photocatalysis, bioremediation, sonolysis, electrochemical oxidation, etc., have been explored and are being developed. The present review article has critically summarized degradative technologies and provides in-depth knowledge of photodegradation, electrochemical degradation, chemical oxidation, and reduction mineralization mechanism. Also, novel non-degradative technologies, including nano-adsorbents, natural and surface-modified clay minerals/zeolites, calixarene-based polymers, and molecularly imprinted polymers and adsorbents derived from biomaterials are discussed in detail. Of these novel approaches photocatalysis combined with membrane filtration or electrochemical oxidation via a treatment train approach shows promising results in removing PFAS in natural waters. The photocatalytic mineralization mechanism of PFOA is discussed, leading to recommendations for future research on novel remediation strategies for removing PFAS from water. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Challenges of TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis on cytostatic compounds
   degradation: state of the art
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The following work provides a perspective on the degradation of cytostatic pollutants through TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis. Cytostatic drugs are emerging pollutants used for cancer treatment found in hospital and domestic wastewater. Small amounts of cytostatic pollutants may pose severe health problems in human beings, animals, and plants after prolonged contact. This research presents a general review of some water treatment methods, such as aerobic activated sludge, enzymatic degradation, nanofiltration and chlorination, that have been used for the degradation or elimination of cytostatic drugs in wastewater. In recent years, photocatalysis has become important to solve this problem; these advanced oxidation process uses pure and modified TiO2 to degrade cytostatic contaminants and convert them into non-harmful substances or to eliminate them completely. This work contains a comprehensive review of the heterogeneous photocatalysis process and mechanism, and its application on the removal of cytostatic pollutants. Even if research on the topic is still scarce, this literature review provides interesting highlights on the scope of the research field, and the path such research could follow.

TI Effects of enhanced recovery after surgery on robotic radical
   prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO GLAND SURGERY
AB Background: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has been shown to be an effective, reliable and practical clinical nursing method to support operations on a range of physiological systems, but its effects on robotic radical prostatectomy (RRP) are still unclear. This study assesses the clinical effects of ERAS in RRP. Methods: Various databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge were searched for relevant studies, in particular full-text articles comparing ERAS groups and conventional groups for RRP. All included articles were subject to a quality assessment, and the data analysis was conducted with Review Manager (5.3). Forest plots, sensitivity analyses, and bias analyses were also prepared based on the included articles. Results: In total, 8 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that ERAS groups exhibited significantly reduced time of flatus [mean difference (MD) =-0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): (-0.88, -0.29); P=0.0001], time of catheter removal [MD =-1.65; 95% CI: (-2.15, -1.16); P<0.00001], and length of stay (LOS) [MD =-1.49; 95% CI: (-2.65, -0.34); P=0.01], and there was no significant difference in terms of postoperative complications between ERAS groups and conventional groups (P=0.07). Discussion: This study provides further evidence that ERAS improves postoperative recovery in patients undergoing RRP through reduced time of first flatus, time of catheter removal and LOS. Given the limited quality and quantity of the articles included in this study, further work is needed to validate these findings.

TI Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of the perioperative
   enhanced recovery after surgery concept on the surgical treatment of
   acute appendicitis in children
SO TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS
AB Background: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), as a new concept in surgery, has dramatically changed the mode of perioperative treatment for children with acute appendicitis.
   Methods: The retrieval strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration was conducted using the CNKI database, Wanfang Medical Network, PubMed, EBSCO, Medline, and Cochrane database by combining subject headings and free words. A review of the randomized controlled trials on the use of the ERAS concept in the perioperative treatment of acute appendicitis in children was conducted between the establishment of the database and May 15, 2021. Keywords included enhanced recovery after surgery, fast track surgery, ERAS, FTS, child, infant, and appendicitis. The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the RevMan 5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration.
   Results: Five randomized controlled trials on ERAS in children with acute appendicitis were finally included. The heterogeneity of postoperative stay time was tested in 4 studies using continuous variables, with Chi-squared test (Chi(2)) =221.52, degree of freedom (dt) =3, I-2= .99%>50%. An overall analysis using a random effects model showed that the ERAS group was significantly different compared to the control group [Z=5.26; mean difference (MD) =-1.65; 95% CI: -2.27 to -1.03; P<0.00001]. The heterogeneity of the readmission rate was tested in 5 studies using dichotomous variables, with Chi(2) =5.11, df =3, I-2 =41%<50%, P=0.91. Overall analysis using a fixed effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the ERAS group and the control group [Z=0.80; odds ratio (OR) =1.16; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.66; P=0.42]. The heterogeneity of the recurrence rate was tested in 4 studies using dichotomous variables, with Chi(2) =3.73, df =3, I-2 =20%<50%, P=0.29. Overall analysis using a fixed effects model showed no statistically significant difference between the ERAS group and the control group (Z=1.14; OR =0.76; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.22; P=0.26).
   Discussion: The results of the meta-analysis confirmed that perioperative application of the ERAS concept in children with acute appendicitis can promote the rehabilitation of children, reduce the postoperative stay time, and reduce the readmission rate and reoperation rate.

TI Occurrence, profiles, and ecotoxicity of poly- and perfluoroalkyl
   substances and their alternatives in global apex predators: A critical
   review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Certain poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exhibit significant bioaccumula-tion/biomagnification behaviors in ecosystems. PFASs, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and related precursors, have elicited attention from both public and national regulatory agencies, which has resulted in world-wide restrictions on their production and use. Apex predators occupy the top trophic positions in ecosystems and are most affected by the biomagnification behavior of PFASs. Meanwhile, the long lifespans of apex predators also lead to the high body burden of PFASs. The high body burden of PFASs might be linked to adverse health effects and even pose a potential threat to their reproduction. As seen in previous reviews of PFASs, knowledge is lacking between the current stage of the PFAS body burden and related effects in apex predators. This review summarized PFAS occurrence in global apex predators, including information on the geographic distribution, levels, profiles, and tissue distribution, and discussed the trophic transfer and ecotoxicity of PFASs. In the case where legacy PFASs were restricted under international convention, the occurrence of novel PFASs, such as 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate (PFECHS), in apex predators arose as an emerging issue. Future studies should develop an effective analytical method and focus on the toxicity and trophic transfer behavior of novel PFASs.

TI Recent Advances in Biopolymeric Membranes towards the Removal of
   Emerging Organic Pollutants from Water
SO MEMBRANES
AB Herein, this paper details a comprehensive review on the biopolymeric membrane applications in micropollutants' removal from wastewater. As such, the implications of utilising non-biodegradable membrane materials are outlined. In comparison, considerations on the concept of utilising nanostructured biodegradable polymeric membranes are also outlined. Such biodegradable polymers under considerations include biopolymers-derived cellulose and carrageenan. The advantages of these biopolymer materials include renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and cost-effectiveness when compared to non-biodegradable polymers. The modifications of the biopolymeric membranes were also deliberated in detail. This included the utilisation of cellulose as matrix support for nanomaterials. Furthermore, attention towards the recent advances on using nanofillers towards the stabilisation and enhancement of biopolymeric membrane performances towards organic contaminants removal. It was noted that most of the biopolymeric membrane applications focused on organic dyes (methyl blue, Congo red, azo dyes), crude oil, hexane, and pharmaceutical chemicals such as tetracycline. However, more studies should be dedicated towards emerging pollutants such as micropollutants. The biopolymeric membrane performances such as rejection capabilities, fouling resistance, and water permeability properties were also outlined.

TI Recent Advances in Dynamic Modeling and Process Control of PVA
   Degradation by Biological and Advanced Oxidation Processes: A Review on
   Trends and Advances
SO ENVIRONMENTS
AB Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is an emerging pollutant commonly found in industrial wastewater, owing to its extensive usage as an additive in the manufacturing industry. PVA's popularity has made wastewater treatment technologies for PVA degradation a popular research topic in industrial wastewater treatment. Although many PVA degradation technologies are studied in bench-scale processes, recent advancements in process optimization and control of wastewater treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) show the feasibility of these processes by monitoring and controlling processes to meet desired regulatory standards. These wastewater treatment technologies exhibit complex reaction mechanisms leading to nonlinear and nonstationary behavior related to variability in operational conditions. Thus, black-box dynamic modeling is a promising tool for designing control schemes since dynamic modeling is more complicated in terms of first principles and reaction mechanisms. This study seeks to provide a survey of process control methods via a comprehensive review focusing on PVA degradation methods, including biological and advanced oxidation processes, along with their reaction mechanisms, control-oriented dynamic modeling (i.e., state-space, transfer function, and artificial neural network modeling), and control strategies (i.e., proportional-integral-derivative control and predictive control) associated with wastewater treatment technologies utilized for PVA degradation.

TI Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion of a New Herbicide,
   Epyrifenacil, in Rats
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The metabolic fate of a newly developed herbicide, epyrifenacil, (ethyl[(3-{2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-[3-methyl-2,6-dioxo4-(trifluoromethyl)-3,6-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl]phenoxy}pyridin-2-yl)oxy]acetate, S-3100), in rats was determined using C-14-labeled epyrifenacil. When it was administered orally to rats at 1 mg/kg, around 73-74% of the dose was absorbed, metabolized, and mainly excreted into feces within 48 h. The elimination of radioactivity in plasma and tissues was rapid, suggesting that exposure of epyrifenacil and metabolites is small. Metabolite analysis revealed that epyrifenacil was rapidly ester-cleaved to M1 and then mainly excreted into bile or further metabolized. No parent was detected in plasma, tissues, and urine. Remarkably, M1 was mainly distributed in the liver (at a concentration of 70-112 times higher than in plasma at a low dose). Furthermore, a significant sexrelated difference was observed in urinary excretion of M1. Considering the above observations with those in the literature, the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) likely plays a role on the active transport of M1 in the liver and kidney.

TI The degradation mechanisms of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
   perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) by different chemical methods: A
   critical review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of artificial compounds comprised of a perfluoroalkyl main chain and a terminal functional group. With them being applied in a wide range of applications, PFASs have drawn increasing regulatory attention and research interests on their reductions and treatments due to their harmful effects on environment and human beings. Among numerous studies, chemical treatments (e.g., photochemical, electrochemical, and thermal technologies) have been proved to be important methods to degradation PFASs. However, the pathways and mechanisms for the degradation of PFASs through these chemical methods still have not been well documented. This article therefore provides a comprehensive review on the degradation mechanisms of two important PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)) with photochemical, electrochemical and thermal methods. Different decomposition mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS are reviewed and discussed. Overall, the degradation pathways of PFASs are associated closely with their head groups and chain lengths, and H/F exchange and chain shortening were found to be predominant degradation mechanisms. The clear study on the degradation mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS should be very useful for the complete degradation or mineralization of PFASs in the future.

TI Micro(nano)plastics as an emerging risk factor to the health of
   amphibian: A scientometric and systematic review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Although the toxicity of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) is recognized at different trophic levels, our know-how about their effects on amphibians is limited. Thus, we present and discuss the current state on studies involving amphibians and plastic particles, based on a broad approach to studies published in the last 5 years. To search for the articles, the ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were consulted, using different descriptors related to the topic of study. After the systematic search, we identified 848 publications. Of these, 12 studies addressed the relationship "plastic particles and amphibians" (7 studies developed in the laboratory and 5 field studies). The scientometric analysis points to geographic concentration of studies in Brazil and China; low investment in research in the area, and limited participation of international authors in the studies carried out. In the systematic approach, we confirm the scarcity of available data on the toxicity of plastic particles in amphibians; we observed a concentration of studies in the Anura order, only one study explored the toxicological effects of NPs and polystyrene and polyethylene are the most studied plastic types. Moreover, the laboratory tested concentrations are distant from those of the environmentally relevant; and little is known about the mechanisms of action of NPs/MPs involved in the identified (eco)toxicological effects. Thus, we strongly recommend more investments in this area, given the ubiquitous nature of NPs/MPs in aquatic environments and their possible consequences on the dynamics, reproduction, and survival of species in the natural environment.

TI Exposure to legacy and novel perfluoroalkyl substance disturbs the
   metabolic homeostasis in pregnant women and fetuses: A metabolome-wide
   association study
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exist extensively and several of these have been verified to be toxic. Prenatal exposure to PFASs has attracted much attention. Metabolome-wide association analyses can be used to explore the toxicity mechanisms of PFASs by identifying associated biomarkers. Objectives: To evaluate associations between the metabolites in maternal and cord serum and internal exposure to several common PFASs. Methods: Paired maternal and cord serum samples were collected from 84 pregnant women who gave birth between 2015 and 2016. Seven legacy and two novel PFASs were measured. A nontarget metabolomic method and an iterative metabolite annotation based on metabolic pathways were applied to characterize the metabolic profiles. Linear regression adjusted with the false discovery rate and covariates was used to indicate the associations. Results: A total of 279 features in maternal serum and 338 features in cord serum were identified as metabolites associated with PFAS exposure. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were two PFASs associated with more metabolites, while the two novel chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) showed less relevance to the metabolome. With pathway enrichment analysis, we found that three fatty acid metabolisms and retinol metabolism were correlated with PFAS exposure in maternal blood, and that sterol metabolism showed the correlation in both maternal serum and cord serum. Conclusions: We identified metabolites and pathways in pregnant women and fetuses associated with the exposure to several PFAS, indicating a promising application for metabolome-wide association studies. Additional research is needed to confirm causation.

TI GenX is not always a better fluorinated organic compound than PFOA: A
   critical review on aqueous phase treatability by adsorption and its
   associated cost
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) has been marketed as a substitute for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to reduce environmental and health risks. GenX and PFOA have been detected in various natural water sources, and adsorption is recognized as a typical treatment process for PFOA removal. In this paper, comparisons of GenX and PFOA adsorption are evaluated, including adsorption potential, adsorption mechanisms, and associated costs. A detailed literature review suggests that anion-exchange resins are more effective in removing GenX than activated carbon. GenX removal efficiency through activated carbon (30%) is lower than that of PFOA (80-95%), while GenX and PFOA removal efficiencies by anion exchange resins are similar (99%). Unconventional adsorbents, such as ionic fluorogels and covalent organic frameworks can effectively remove GenX from water. The review reveals that GenX adsorption is more challenging, requiring almost 4 times the treatment cost of its predecessor, PFOA. Annual operation and maintenance costs for GenX adsorption (initial concentration of GenX and PFOA = 0.2 mu g.L-1) by GAC for treating 10,000 m(3) per day is almost US$1,000,000 per year, but only around US$240,000 per year for PFOA. Desorption of GenX in the presence of PFOA highlights GenX's inferior treatability by adsorption. It is believed that GenX is a more environmentally friendly compound than PFOA, but this environmental friendliness comes with the price.

TI Organic pollutants in deep sea: Occurrence, fate, and ecological
   implications
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The deep sea - an oceanic layer below 200 m depths - has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions. It also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak emission, faster in young deep waters (< 10 years) compared to older deep waters (> 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations (< 10 pg L-1) and vertical variations in the South Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (< 1000 years). Steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we found that, even though an estimated 1.2-4.2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants (e.g., plastic monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is often overlooked. Finally, we recommend assessing the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea biota, large-scale monitoring of organic pollutants, reconstructing historical emissions using sediment cores, and assessing the impact of deep-sea mining on the ecosystem.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of EPs, including microplastics, engineered nanomaterials, disinfection byproducts, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, on the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs. State-of-the-art methods for identifying culture-independent ARG-host interactions and monitoring horizontal gene transfer (HGT) processes in real-time are first reviewed. The contributions of EPs to the abundance and diversity of ARGs are then summarized. Finally, we discussed the underlying mechanisms related to the regulation of HGT, increased mutagenesis, and the evolution of microbial communities. Further details of three HGT (i.e., conjugation, transformation, and transduction) frequency patterns in response to various EPs are also examined. This review contemplates and reassesses the risks of ARG evolution posed by the manufacture and application of EPs

TI Targeting integrated epigenetic and metabolic pathways in lethal
   childhood PFA ependymomas
SO SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Childhood posterior fossa group A ependymomas (PFAs) have limited treatment options and bear dismal prognoses compared to group B ependymomas (PFBs). PFAs overexpress the oncohistone-like protein EZHIP (enhancer of Zeste homologs inhibitory protein), causing global reduction of repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), similar to the oncohistone H3K27M. Integrated metabolic analyses in patient-derived cells and tumors, single-cell RNA sequencing of tumors, and noninvasive metabolic imaging in patients demonstrated enhanced glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism in PFAs. Furthermore, high glycolytic gene expression in PFAs was associated with a poor outcome. PFAs demonstrated high EZHIP expression associated with poor prognosis and elevated activating mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Genomic H3K27ac was enriched in PFAs at key glycolytic and TCA cycle-related genes including hexokinase-2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Similarly, mouse neuronal stem cells (NSCs) expressing wild-type EZHIP (EZHIP-WT) versus catalytically attenuated EZHIP-M406K demonstrated H3K27ac enrichment at hexokinase-2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase, accompanied by enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. AMPK alpha-2, a key component of the metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), also showed H3K27ac enrichment in PFAs and EZHIP-WT NSCs. The AMPK activator metformin lowered EZHIP protein concentrations, increased H3K27me3, suppressed TCA cycle metabolism, and showed therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived PFA xenografts in mice. Our data indicate that PFAs and EZHIP-WT-expressing NSCs are characterized by enhanced glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism. Repurposing the antidiabetic drug metformin lowered pathogenic EZHIP, increased H3K27me3, and suppressed tumor growth, suggesting that targeting integrated metabolic/epigenetic pathways is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating childhood ependymomas.

TI Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as a contaminant of emerging
   concern in surface water: A transboundary review of their occurrences
   and toxicity effects
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) due to their environmental impact. Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially. These compounds are also potentially associated with adverse impacts on human health, animals and biota.

TI Recent advances in data-mining techniques for measuring transformation
   products by high-resolution mass spectrometry
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Investigation on transformation products (TPs) of environmental contaminants is important for chemical exposure risk assessments. However, the task of identifying potential TPs in complex environmental matrices is very challenging. Advanced data-mining techniques have greatly accelerated the process of TP recognition and identification, which should be included as part of an integrated analytical workflow along with robust sample preparation and data acquisition protocols. In this review, the methods for enrichment of TPs from various sample matrix and the data acquisition modes by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are summarized. Further, advanced data-mining techniques including suspect screening by in-silico prediction, case-control strategy, stable isotope labeling, mass defect filtering, and product ion filtering are critically reviewed. The gaps in the current knowledge and future trends for the identification of TPs are also discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Trends in the Regulation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS):
   A Scoping Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Products containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used for decades in industrial and consumer products. These compounds are persistent in the environment, bioaccumulative, and some are toxic to humans and other animals. Since the early 2000s, laws, policies, and regulations have been implemented to reduce the prevalence of PFAS in the environment and exposures to PFAS. We conducted a scoping literature review to identify how PFAS are regulated internationally, at the U.S. national level, and at the U.S. state level, as well as drivers of and challenges to implementing PFAS regulations in the U.S. This review captured peer-reviewed scientific literature (e.g., PubMed), grey literature databases (e.g., SciTech Premium Collection), Google searches, and targeted websites (e.g., state health department websites). We identified 454 relevant documents, of which 61 discussed the non-U.S. PFAS policy, 214 discussed the U.S. national-level PFAS policy, and 181 discussed the U.S. state-level PFAS policy. The drivers of and challenges to PFAS regulation were identified through qualitative analysis. The drivers of PFAS policy identified were political support for regulation, social awareness of PFAS, economic resource availability, and compelling scientific evidence. The challenges to implementing PFAS regulations were political limitations, economic challenges, unclear scientific evidence, and practical challenges. The implications for PFAS policy makers and other stakeholders are discussed.</p>

TI The Implications of Membranes Used as Separators in Microbial Fuel Cells
SO MEMBRANES
AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are electrochemical devices focused on bioenergy generation and organic matter removal carried out by microorganisms under anoxic environments. In these types of systems, the anodic oxidation reaction is catalyzed by anaerobic microorganisms, while the cathodic reduction reaction can be carried out biotically or abiotically. Membranes as separators in MFCs are the primary requirements for optimal electrochemical and microbiological performance. MFC configuration and operation are similar to those of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)-both having at least one anode and one cathode split by a membrane or separator. The Nafion(R) 117 (NF-117) membrane, made from perfluorosulfonic acid, is a membrane used as a separator in PEMFCs. By analogy of the operation between electrochemical systems and MFCs, NF-117 membranes have been widely used as separators in MFCs. The main disadvantage of this type of membrane is its high cost; membranes in MFCs can represent up to 60% of the MFC's total cost. This is one of the challenges in scaling up MFCs: finding alternative membranes or separators with low cost and good electrochemical characteristics. The aim of this work is to critically review state-of-the-art membranes and separators used in MFCs. The scope of this review includes: (i) membrane functions in MFCs, (ii) most-used membranes, (iii) membrane cost and efficiency, and (iv) membrane-less MFCs. Currently, there are at least 20 different membranes or separators proposed and evaluated for MFCs, from basic salt bridges to advanced synthetic polymer-based membranes, including ceramic and unconventional separator materials. Studies focusing on either low cost or the use of natural polymers for proton-exchange membranes (PEM) are still scarce. Alternatively, in some works, MFCs have been operated without membranes; however, significant decrements in Coulombic efficiency were found. As the type of membrane affects the performance and total cost of MFCs, it is recommended that research efforts are increased in order to develop new, more economic membranes that exhibit favorable properties and allow for satisfactory cell performance at the same time. The current state of the art of membranes for MFCs addressed in this review will undoubtedly serve as a key insight for future research related to this topic.</p>

TI Associations between human internal chemical exposure to Persistent
   Organic Pollutants (POPs) and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes:
   Systematic review and evidence map of human epidemiological evidence
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB The impact of environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on reproductive health is still poorly understood, despite the high societal and economical costs. The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented 'serious' or 'very serious' risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we judged the level of evidence being "low". Given the high economical and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further well-designed research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps.

TI Hospital effluent guidelines and legislation scenario around the globe:
   A critical review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Laboratories, dialysis units, and other similar facilities are important sources of negative contribution to wastewater from healthcare facilities. They dispose of pharmaceutical residues as well as unsafe pollutants such as pharmaceutical remainders, hazardous chemical agents, pathogens, as well as radio-isotopes. Wastes from these departments may contain traces of pathogenic and cytotoxic microorganisms, as well as radioactive isotopes. This state of wastewater poses a chemical, physical and biological threat to the environment due to the significant amount of hazardous pollutants. It also poses a high risk to public health. Unfortunately, the juridical and legal system does not oblige them to take care of hospital effluents' safety before being discharged into the general sewer system or the environment. Since the risk associated with wastewater composition from medical institutions is enormous, leading us to ensure high-end preparation and treatment of such wastewater before it is discharged into the sewer. Many countries do not have strict standards and legal responsibility to discharge highhazard pollutants like those found in wastewater from medical institutions.
   Consequently, it is time for concern since there are increasing amounts of such effluents, and there is currently no legislative regulation and high-quality treatment for emerging contaminants. Unfortunately, even many developed countries do not regulate pharmaceutical residues at the legislative level. For this reason, this review aims to highlight key points in current regulations, legislation, and guidelines for the control of hazardous pharmaceutical wastewater and emerging contaminants. This review also purposes to focus the practitioners' attention to the development and strengthening of legislative norms regarding the medical institution's effluent.

TI Representation of Minority Groups in Key Pelvic Floor Disorder Trials
SO FEMALE PELVIC MEDICINE AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB Background Multicenter randomized clinical trials on pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) support evidence-based care. However, many of these studies include homogenous study populations lacking diversity. Heterogeneous sampling allows for greater generalizability while increasing knowledge regarding specific subgroups. The racial/ethnic makeup of key pelvic floor disorder (PFD) trials has not been examined. Objective This study aimed to investigate racial/ethnic representation in major PFD clinical trials in comparison to racial/ethnic distribution of PFD in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods Demographic data were extracted from completed PFD Network (PFDN) and Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network studies, which have resulted in nearly 200 publications. Prevalence of PFD by race/ethnicity was obtained from the NHANES. A representative index (Observed "n" by PFD study/Expected "n" based on the NHANES-reported prevalence) was calculated as a measure of representation. Meta-analyses were performed for each outcome and overall with respect to race/ethnicity. Results Eighteen PFDN/Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network studies were analyzed. White women comprised 70%-89% of PFD literature; Black women, 6%-16%; Hispanic women, 9%-15%; Asians, 0.5%-6%; and American Indians, 0%-2%. Representation of White women was higher in 13 of 18 PFDN studies compared with the NHANES prevalence data. Representation of Black women was either decreased or not reported in 10 of 18 index studies compared with the NHANES prevalence data. Hispanic women were absent or underrepresented in 7 of 18 PFDN studies compared with the prevalence data. Conclusions Our examination of PFDN and other landmark trials demonstrates inconsistent reporting of minority subgroups, limiting applicability with respect to minority populations. Our study suggests that PFD research would benefit from targeted sampling of minority groups.

TI Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure during pregnancy and adverse
   pregnancy and birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during pregnancy has been suggested to be associated with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes; however, the findings have been inconsistent. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of these associations.
   Methods: The online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched comprehensively for eligible studies from inception to February 2021. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random- or fixed-effects models, and dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible.
   Findings: A total of 29 studies (32,905 participants) were included. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluomoctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure during pregnancy was linearly associated with increased preterm birth risk (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00-1.02, P = 0.009) and perfluomnonanoate (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) exposure showed inverted U-shaped associations with preterm birth risk (P values for the nonlinear trend: 0.025 and 0.030). Positive associations were also observed for exposure to perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and miscarriage (pooled OR per 1-ng/ml increase: 1.87, 95% CIs: 1.15-3.03) and PFOS and preeclampsia (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 1.27, 95% CIs: 1.06-1.51), whereas exposure to perfluomundecanoate (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with preeclampsia risk (pooled OR per 1-log increase: 0.81, 95% CIs: 0.71-0.93). Based on individual evidence, detrimental effects were observed between PFDA exposure and small for gestational age and between PFOA and PFOS and intrauterine growth restriction. No significant associations were found between pregnancy PFAS exposure and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (i. e., gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight, and large and small for gestational age).
   Interpretation: Our findings indicated that PFOS, PFOA and PFNA exposure during pregnancy might be associated with increased preterm birth risk and that PFAS exposure might be associated with the risk of miscarriage and preeclampsia. Due to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to confirm these findings.

TI Stem Cells in Clinical Trials for Pelvic Floor Disorders: a Systematic
   Literature Review
SO REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES
AB Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) include a series of conditions that can be poorly tolerated, negatively affecting the quality of life. Current treatment options show unsatisfactory results and new ones are therefore needed. Stem cell (SC) therapy might be an alternative treatment strategy. This systematic review aims to define the state of art of SC therapy for PFDs in clinical trials, by systematically reviewing the available evidence. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to November 7, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. Preclinical studies on animal models were not considered. Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites. However, a clear beneficial impact of SC treatment for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders could not be demonstrated. Further larger targeted studies with control arms are needed before any conclusions can be made.

TI The integration of MS-based metabolomics and multivariate data analysis
   allows for improved quality assessment of Zingiber officinale Roscoe
SO PHYTOCHEMISTRY
AB Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is consumed for health-promoting effects and as a food condiment. Comprehensive phytochemical analysis, other than gingerols and shogaols, has not yet been deeply investigated. Hence, the current research aimed to establish a non-targeted metabolomics approach for the discrimination between fresh ginger rhizome samples collected from four different producing countries, i.e., China, India, Pakistan, and Peru. In addition, lab-dried samples were analyzed to trace drying-induced metabolites. A comprehensive extraction procedure was carried out resulting in production of polar and non-polar fractions. The polar fraction was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Fourier transform tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-C18-FT-MS/MS) and gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCTOF-MS) post derivatization. UPLC-C8-FT-MS/MS was used for analysis of non-polar fraction. Results revealed for identification of a total of 253 metabolites. In addition, multivariate data analysis (MVDA), including principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated clustering of Asian specimens. Several metabolites with a characteristic pattern for the origin revealing the highest contents of bioactive metabolites in the Peruvian product. Moreover, chemical markers identified, including [6]-gingerol and [6]-shogaol discriminating between fresh and dried samples. Furthermore, abundances of some primary metabolites, including amino acids and cinnamic acid, have confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of gingerols and their transformation upon drying to shogaols. The proposed approach can be applied as a potential candidate for quality assessment of ginger and other medicinal plants.

TI Metabolomic profiles of A-type procyanidin dimer and trimer with gut
   microbiota in vitro
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS
AB Although intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the metabolism of procyanidins, the microbial metabolic pathway of A-type procyanidins remains elusive. In this study, A-type dimer procyanidin A1 [EC-(28-O7,48-8)-C] and trimer PPD [EC-(48-6)-EC-(28-O-7,48-8)-C] were incubated with rat faecal microbiota in vitro, and their metabolomic profiles were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF/MS. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 24 and 30 discriminant metabolites for A1 and PPD, respectively. The C-ring opened catabolites of procyanidin A1 and PPD and the typical phenolic acid metabolites were identified, including phenylacetic acid, (4 '-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 3-phenylpropanoic acid, 3-(4 '-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 3-(3 ',4 '-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid, and 5-(3 ',4 '-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone. Notably, procyanidin A1 and (epi)catechin were identified from the metabolites of PPD; however, no (epi)catechin was found in the metabolites of procyanidin A1, indicating that the faecal microbiota can destroy B-type linkage (C4-C6 interflavan bond) but not A-type linkage (C4-C8 and additional C2-O-C7 interflavan bond) in the metabolism of A-type procyanidins.

TI Free throw shooting performance under pressure: a social psychology
   critical review of research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY
AB The Free-Throw Shot (FTS) in basketball is a unique uncontested closed skill undertaken during a stoppage in play at a uniform distance. In recent years, FTS has emerged as a prime target for stress research due to its highly controlled nature and its significant impact on the game outcome. In this narrative review, we appraise empirical research with a social-psychological focus on studying FTS success under pressure. This critical review comprises 44 empirical studies published up to June 2020. We first assess the importance of FTS within the game of basketball and study historical trends. We then elaborate on the unique psychological features of FTS. Subsequently, research on the undermining effects of pressure from both archival game studies and experiments is critically evaluated. We conclude with a discussion of performance in relationship to expertise and sources of threat. The review highlights current research deficiencies, provides recommendations for theoretical research and applied practice.

TI Rain Amplification of Persistent Organic Pollutants
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Scavenging of gas- and aerosol-phase organic pollutants by rain is an efficient wet deposition mechanism of organic pollutants. However, whereas snow has been identified as a key amplification mechanism of fugacities in cold environments, rain has received less attention in terms of amplification of organic pollutants. In this work, we provide new measurements of concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), organophosphate esters (OPEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rain from Antarctica, showing high scavenging ratios. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of previously published concentrations in air and rain was performed, with 46 works covering different climatic regions and a wide range of chemical classes, including PFAS, OPEs, PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine compounds, polybromodiphenyl ethers, and dioxins. The rain-aerosol (KRP) and rain-gas (KRG) partition constants averaged 105.5 and 104.1, respectively, but showed large variability. The high field-derived values of KRG are consistent with adsorption onto the raindrops as a scavenging mechanism, in addition to gas-water absorption. The amplification of fugacities by rain deposition was up to 3 orders of magnitude for all chemical classes and was comparable to that due to snow. The amplification of concentrations and fugacities by rain underscores its relevance, explaining the occurrence of organic pollutants in environments across different climatic regions.

TI Effect of microplastics on aquatic biota: A hormetic perspective
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) have been found globally in various freshwater and marine matrices. This study recompiled 270 endpoints of 3765 individuals from 43 publications, reporting the onset of enhanced biological performance and reduced oxidative stress biomarkers induced by MPs in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations (<= 1 mg/L, median = 0.1 mg/L). The stimulatory responses of consumption, growth, reproduction and survival ranged from 131% to 144% of the control, with a combined response of 136%. The overall inhibitory response of 9 oxidative stress biomarkers was 71% of the control, and commonly below 75%. The random-effects meta-regression indicated that the extents of MPs-induced responses were independent of habitat, MP composition, morphology, particle size and exposure duration. The results implied that the exposure to MPs at low and high concentrations might induce opposite/non-monotonic responses in aquatic biota. Correspondingly, the hormetic dose response relationships were found at various endpoints, such as reproduction, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity and behavioral alteration. Hormesis offers a novel perspective for understanding the dose response mode of aquatic organisms exposed to low and high concentrations of MPs, highlighting the necessity to incorporate the hormetic dose response model into the ecological/ environmental risk assessment of MPs.

TI Early-Life Exposure to Per- and Poly-Fluorinated Alkyl Substances and
   Growth, Adiposity, and Puberty in Children: A Systematic Review
SO FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a family of synthetic polyfluorinated compounds, are widely used in consumer products. Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories.

TI Perfluoroalkyl acids on suspended particles: Significant transport
   pathways in surface runoff, surface waters, and subsurface soils
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Eroded particles from the source zone could transport a high concentration of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) to sediments and water bodies. Yet, the contribution of suspended particles has not been systematically reviewed. Analyzing reported studies, we quantitatively demonstrate that suspended particles in surface water can contain significantly higher concentrations of PFAAs than the sediment below, indicating the source of suspended particles are not the sediment but particles eroded and carried from the source zone upstream. The affinity of PFAAs to particles depends on the particle composition, including organic carbon fraction and iron or aluminum oxide content. In soils, most PFAAs are retained within the top 5 m below the ground surface. The distribution of PFAAs in the subsurface varies based on site properties and local weather conditions. The depth corresponding to the maximum concentration of PFAA in soil decreases with an increase in soil organic carbon or rainfall amount received in the catchment areas. We attribute a greater accumulation of PFAAs near the upper layer of the subsurface to an increase in the accumulation of particles eroded from source zones upstream receiving heavy rainfall. Precursor transformation in the aerobic zone is significantly higher than in the anaerobic zone, thereby making the aerobic subsurface zone serve as a long-term source of groundwater pollution. Collectively, these results suggest that suspended particles, often an overlooked vector for PFAAs, can be a dominant pathway for the transport of PFAAs in environments.

TI Associations between Exposures to Perfluoroalkyl Substances and
   Diabetes, Hyperglycemia, or Insulin Resistance: A Scoping Review
SO JOURNAL OF XENOBIOTICS
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent environmental pollutants that are commonly found in the human body due to exposures via drinking water, surfactants used in consumer materials, and aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs). PFAS exposure has been linked to adverse health effects such as low infant birth weights, cancer, and endocrine disruption, though increasingly studies have demonstrated that they may perturb metabolic processes and contribute to dysfunction. This scoping review summarizes the chemistry of PFAS exposure and the epidemiologic evidence for associations between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the development of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and/or insulin resistance. We identified 11 studies on gestational diabetes mellitus, 3 studies on type 1 diabetes, 7 studies on type 2 diabetes, 6 studies on prediabetes or unspecified diabetes, and 15 studies on insulin resistance or glucose tolerance using the SCOPUS and PubMed databases. Approximately 24 reported positive associations, 9 negative associations, 2 non-linear associations, and 2 inverse associations, and 8 reported no associations found between PFAS and all diabetes search terms. Cumulatively, these data indicate the need for further studies to better assess these associations between PFAS exposure and diabetes.

TI Plant Feed Additives as Natural Alternatives to the Use of Synthetic
   Antioxidant Vitamins on Livestock Mammals' Performances, Health, and
   Oxidative Status: A Review of the Literature in the Last 20 Years
SO ANTIOXIDANTS
AB In the last two decades, the interest in natural plant feed additives (PFA) as alternatives to synthetic vitamins in livestock nutrition has increased. After a systematic review, a total of 19 peer-reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2020 were retained to evaluate the antioxidant effects of PFA compared to synthetic antioxidant vitamins (mainly vitamin E; VitE) in livestock nutrition. These studies demonstrated that PFAs could be as efficient as VitE in counteracting oxidative stress in pigs, rabbits, and ruminants. However, PFAs only positively affected animals' growth performance and feed efficiency in some monogastric studies. The PFA can affect antioxidant enzyme activity in a dose- and method of administration-dependent manner. The antioxidant capacity of both PFA and VitE were depressed in cows fed with diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Variability among studies could be related to species differences. Despite the interest of the feed industry sector in PFA, there are still very few studies evaluating their antioxidant effect in species other than poultry.

TI Surveying the Chemical Anthropocene Chemical Imaginaries and the

SO ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY-ADVANCES IN RESEARCH
AB Faced with the non-optional acceptance of toxic chemical artifacts, the ubiquitous interweaving of chemicals in our social fabric often exists out of sight and out of mind. Yet, for many, toxic exposures signal life-changing or life-ending events, phantom threats that fail to appear as such until they become too late to mitigate. Assessments of toxicological risk consist of what Sheila Jasanoff calls "sociotechnical imaginaries," arbitrations between calculated costs and benefits, known risks and scientifically wrought justifications of safety. Prevalent financial conflicts of interest and the socially determined hazards posed by chemical exposure suggest that chemical safety assessments and regulations are a form of postnormal science. Focusing on the histories of risk assessments of pesticides such as DDT, atrazine, PFAS, and glyphosate, this article critically reviews Michel Serres's notion of "appropriation by contamination."

TI Examining the Necessity of Postoperative Day-1 Review After Pars Plana
   Vitrectomy: A Meta-Analysis
SO OPHTHALMIC SURGERY LASERS & IMAGING RETINA
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the necessity of the postoperative day-1 (POD1) review after pars plana vitrectomy.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis included available literature that documented medical and surgical interventions performed on POD1 review after pars plana vitrectomy. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted using a binomial-normal model to analyze three data sets consisting of all interventions, medical interventions, and surgical interventions. Heterogeneity and publication bias analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: POD1 reviews of 2,262 patients across 14 studies were examined to yield a total POD1 intervention rate estimate of 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-13.9). When stratified by medical or surgical intervention, the intervention rate estimates were 4.1% (95% CI, 1.4-11.6) and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3-1.3), respectively. The most common complication requiring postoperative intervention was elevated intraocular pressure.
   CONCLUSION: Given the wide confidence intervals of the estimated intervention rates, variability in postoperative practices, and range of interventions performed, the POD1 review cannot be discarded in its entirety.

TI Radical-mediated rearrangements: past, present, and future
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Rearrangement reactions, one of the most significant transformations in organic chemistry, play an irreplaceable role in improving synthetic efficiency and molecular complexity. Concomitant cleavage and reconstruction of chemical bonds can display the great artistry and the glamour of synthetic chemistry. Over the past century, ionic rearrangement reactions, in particular those involving cationic pathways, have represented most of the research. Alongside the renaissance of radical chemistry, radical-mediated rearrangements have recently seen a rapid increase of attention from the chemical community. Many new radical rearrangements that extensively reveal the migratory behaviour of functional groups have been unveiled in the last decade. This Review provides a comprehensive perspective on the area from the past to present achievements, and brings up the prospects that may inspire colleagues to develop more useful synthetic tools based on radical rearrangements.

TI Changes in soil salinity under treated wastewater irrigation: A
   meta-analysis
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB In view of water shortages, the development and utilization of unconventional water resources have been studied extensively. Treated domestic or industrial wastewater used for agricultural irrigation is an unconventional water resource utilization method. Due to the particularities of water sources, previous studies have mainly focused on changes in soil heavy metals, microorganisms, and organic substances and crop responses to toxic elements; thus, attention to soil salinity is of secondary importance. After selecting qualifying research, a meta-analysis was performed to statistically analyze the data of seven variables (potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and yield) to 1) estimate the mean effects of treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation on the soil salinity, soil pH and crop yield; and 2) identify the wastewater treatment grade (primary treated wastewater (PTW), secondary treated wastewater (STW), and tertiary treated wastewater (TTW)) and soil texture (sandy texture, loamy texture and clayey texture) that benefit TWW irrigation. The results showed that TWW irrigation caused a significant accumulation of soil salinity, and the increase in cation content from high to low was K (90.1%), Na (59.9%), Mg (25.2%) and Ca (17.3%). EC also increased significantly by approximately 57.2%, while there was no significant change in pH, and even the crop yield presented an average reduction of nearly 6.5%. PTW contributed to the largest salt accumulation, followed by TTW and STW. STW showed a significant increase in EC but did not show a significant change for the four ions. In terms of yield, STW can increase yield, while TTW has the opposite effect. In general, the sandier the soil texture, the higher is the salt content detected, although the retention of salt in loamy textured soil may differ depending on the ions. The yield of crops grown increased in the clayey textured soil and decreased in the loamy textured soil. Our study elucidated the response of soil salinity accumulation under TWW irrigation and could provide a reference for unconventional water resource utilization.

TI Within and between breeding-season changes in contaminant occurrence and
   body condition in the Antarctic breeding south polar skua
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The Antarctic ecosystem represents a remote region far from point sources of pollution. Still, Antarctic marine predators, such as seabirds, are exposed to organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) which may induce adverse health effects. With increasing restrictions and regulations on OHCs, the levels and exposure are expected to decrease over time. We studied south polar skua (Catharacta maccormiciki), a top predator seabird, to compare OHC concentrations measured in whole blood from 2001/2002 and 2013/2014 in Dronning Maud Land. As a previous study found increasing organochlorine concentrations with sampling day during the 2001/2002 breeding season, suggesting dietary changes, we investigated if this increase was repeated in the 2013/2014 breeding season. In addition to organochlorines, we analyzed hydroxy-metabolites, brominated contaminants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 2013/2014, as well as dietary descriptors of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, to assess potential changes in diet during breeding. Lipid normalized concentrations of individual OHCs were 63%, 87% and 105% higher for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (pchlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), and n-ary sumation Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), respectively, in 2013/2014 compared to 2001/2002. South polar skuas males in 2013/2014 were in poorer body condition than in 2001/ 2002, and with higher pollutant levels. Poorer body condition may cause the remobilization of contaminants from stored body reserves, and continued exposure to legacy contaminants at overwintering areas may explain the unexpected higher OHC concentrations in 2013/2014 than 2001/2002. Concentrations of protein-associated PFAS increased with sampling day during the 2013/2014 breeding season, whereas the lipid-soluble chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) showed no change. OHC occurrence was not correlated with stable isotopes. The PFAS biomagnification through the local food web at the colony should be investigated further.

TI Fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones: An efficient reagent for the
   synthesis of fluoroalkylated compounds
SO SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY
AB Fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones are versatile reagents that can be used to synthesize a wide range of diverse fluoroalkylated organic molecules. Although it has been known since 1975, the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones has recently only received great attention from the scientific community. Generally, they are used as either safe and bench-stable diazo precursors in carbene transfer reactions or as 1,3-dipoles in cycloaddition and cyclization reactions. Notably, fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones to replace toxic fluoroalkyl diazo compounds in carbene transfer reactions reduce the risk of rapid accumulation of explosive diazo compounds and improve functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Given the growing importance of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones in chemical synthesis, a comprehensive review of this topic in the literature is essential to demonstrate their synthetic potential. In this review, we critically summarize and comprehensively analyze the publications in various literatures on the chemistry of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones starting from 1990 to date. The classification of the different reactivity profiles of fluoroalkyl N-sulfonyl hydrazones and the efficiencies of similar types of reactions or substrates with fluoroalkyl diazo compounds are compared.

TI Ultrasound as an Advanced Oxidative Process: A Review on Treating
   Pharmaceutical Compounds
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY
AB Ultrasound treatment, among the various existing water and effluent treatment techniques, is considered an emerging method in recent years due to the degradation of complex organic and inorganic contaminants. It offers substantial advantages, such as cleanliness, safety, and minor or non-existent secondary pollution products, when compared to other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). A systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature relating the use of ultrasound as an AOP is provided based on theoretical concepts and factors that influence sonochemical reactions. The synergistic effects of ultrasound with other degradation technologies for the oxidation of medications are investigated and the importance of assessing toxicity and biodegradability for the treatment of water and effluents with emerging pollutants is evaluated. The mechanistic understanding of the sonochemical effects in drugs, classification of intermediates, and the development of new treatment technologies are still the subject of future research, however, the synergy of treatments and cavitation studies must be considered.

TI Liquid Ventilation in the Management of Preterm Infants
SO CURRENT STEM CELL REPORTS
AB Purpose of Review Complications of prematurity consistently rank as the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 and as the leading cause of death in infants in North America according to Liu et al. Lancet (2016); 388: 3027-35 and Callaghan et al. Pediatrics (2006);118: 1566-73. Despite advances in prenatal care, prematurity remains a persistent clinical problem, with 1 in 8 births occurring prematurely (prior to 37 weeks of gestation) in the USA as discussed by Frey and Klebanoff Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2016);21: 68-73, . Advances in neonatology including gentle ventilation strategies, permissive hypercapnia, and the use of corticosteroids have led to substantial improvements in survival; however, long-term survivors of preterm birth face considerable morbidities affecting every major organ system. Chronic lung disease represents one of the most common and significant long-term complications of preterm birth and is attributable largely to iatrogenic injury due to the underdeveloped nature of the alveoli and lack of compliance of the immature lung as stated by Behrman and Butler (2007). Conventional gas-based ventilation of the premature lung leads to barotrauma, inflammation, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) as discussed by Sinha and Donn Semin Fetal Neonatal Med (2006);11: 166-73. Recent Findings Since the discovery of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) over 70 years ago, liquid ventilation has been examined as a viable alternative to conventional gas-based mechanical ventilation in a variety of disease models, including that of extreme prematurity. PFCs are biologically inert organofluorine compounds with remarkably high gas dissolving properties due to weak intermolecular attractive forces, allowing dissolution of up to twenty times the amount of oxygen and three times the amount of carbon dioxide than water as discussed by Wesseler, Iltis, and Clark J Fluor Chem. Elsevier Sequoia S.A (1977);9: 137-46. These compounds have low surface tension, have low viscosity, are relatively dense, and have low vapor pressure (11-85 torr), permitting rapid evaporation from the lungs. One perfluorocarbon liquid of particular clinical interest is perflubron, a PFC with a bromine substituted for a primary fluorine. This compound has been used as a contrast medium and is radiographically opaque, allowing clinicians to examine lung filling in real time according to the study of Kazerooni et al. Radiology (1962);198: 137-42 . Initial studies of liquid ventilation have shown increased gas exchange and alveoli recruitment, in addition to the return to fluid-filled physiology similar to that experienced during gestation, as discussed by Kylstram et al. Trans Am SOC Artif Intern Organs (1962;8: 378-83, Clark and Gollan (1966), and Schoenfisch Anid and Kylstra J Appl Physiol (1973);35: 117-21, leading to the identification of liquid ventilation as a promising intervention to support critically preterm infants. This review will summarize the history of clinical and translational research studies of liquid ventilation, with a focus on studies targeting prematurity, and will explore the areas requiring further study prior to widespread clinical implementation.

TI Association between maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), a class of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are widely used in consumer products due to their unique amphiphilic properties. Previous epidemiological studies suggest association of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, while evidences about the association are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified from three databases before 2020. The quality, heterogeneity and possibility of publication bias of included studies were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Q-statistic and Begg's test, respectively. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were obtained by means of random-effects meta-analysis models. Meta-analysis results revealed that maternal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) may have a positive association with preterm birth (OR - 1.20.95% G: 1.04, 1.38). The pooled estimates also showed limited evidence of association between maternal perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and miscarriage (OR - 1.48, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.38) with obvious heterogeneity (I-2 = 93.9, p < 0.01). However, no such significant associations were found between the other PFASs and miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. In addition, the subgroup analyses showed that studies on the relationship of maternal PFASs exposure and miscarriage were mainly contributed by developed countries. The meta-analysis results indicated maternal exposure to PFOS can increase the risk of preterm birth. The results of the included studies are inconsistent and the effects of PFASs on human health are complex. Further studies with enough samples are required to verify these findings.

TI Precision Biotransformation of Emerging Pollutants by Human Cytochrome
   P450 Using Computational-Experimental Synergy: A Case Study of
   Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) Phosphate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Precision biotransformation is an envisioned strategy offering detailed insights into biotransformation pathways in real environmental settings using experimentally guided high-accuracy quantum chemistry. Emerging pollutants, whose metabolites are easily overlooked but may cause idiosyncratic toxicity, are important targets of such a strategy. We demonstrate here that complex metabolic reactions of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) catalyzed by human CYP450 enzymes can be mapped via a three-step synergy strategy: (i) screening the possible metabolites via highthroughout (moderate-accuracy) computations; (ii) analyzing the proposed metabolites in vitro by human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP450 enzymes; and (iii) rationalizing the experimental data via precise mechanisms using high-level targeted computations. Through the bilateral dialogues from qualitative to semi-quantitative to quantitative levels, we show how TDCIPP metabolism especially by CYP3A4 generates bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) as an O-dealkylation metabolite and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) 3-chloro-1-hydroxy-2-propyl phosphate (alcohol(beta-dehalogen)) as a dehalogenation/reduction metabolite via the initial rate-determining H-abstraction from alpha C- and beta C-positions. The relative yield ratio [dehalogenation/reduction]/[O-dealkylation] is derived from the relative barriers of H-abstraction at the beta C- and alpha C-positions by CYP3A4, estimated as 0.002 to 0.23, viz., an in vitro measured ratio of 0.04. Importantly, alcohol(beta-dehalogen) formation points to a new mechanism involving successive oxidation and reduction functions of CYP450, with its precursor aldehyde(beta-dehalogen) being a key intermediate detected by trapping assays and rationalized by computations. We conclude that the proposed three-step synergy strategy may meet the increasing challenge of elucidating biotransformation mechanisms of substantial synthesized organic compounds in the future.

TI Polyaniline-based adsorbents for aqueous pollutants removal: A review
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Water contamination by a variety of pollutants, such as conventional pollutants (e.g. heavy metals and organics) and emerging micropollutants (e.g. personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds) is of great concern. Various technologies have been developed to address this critical challenge. Among them, adsorption by polyaniline (PANI)-based nanocomposites, has gained growing research interest recently due to their unique electrical characteristics and many other benefits, such as facile synthesis, low cost, excellent environmental stability, simple acid-base doping/dedoping process, reactive NH- groups, and tunable properties. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the typical PANI-based adsorbents and their properties. Moreover, the removal of various aqueous contaminants (including heavy metals and metalloids, organic dyes and emerging pollutants) by PANI-based adsorbents is discussed and assessed. The unique doping/dedoping of PANI-based adsorbents alters the morphology, pore size, surface charge and functional groups of the adsorbents, leading to enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate interactions and thus adsorption performance. The adsorption mechanisms of aqueous pollutants by PANI-based adsorbents include electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, pi-pi interactions, hydrogen bonding, chelating and/or complexation effects. Finally, the future outlooks on aqueous pollutants removal by PANI-based adsorbents are presented.

TI Perfluorooctane Sulfonate in US Ambient Surface Waters: A Review of
   Occurrence in Aquatic Environments and Comparison to Global
   Concentrations
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is one of the dominant perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) detected in aquatic ecosystems. It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam-use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non-point source-related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

TI Early-life exposure to widespread environmental toxicants and children's
   health risks: A focus on the post-vaccination antibody potency or
   immunoglobulin levels
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Early-life exposure to widespread environmental toxicants including organic pollutants (OPs), heavy metals, and air pollutants is detrimental to human health. The immunotoxicity of these environmental toxicants are well acknowledged and a few studies have focused on the relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and vaccine antibody potency or immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in children. Altered antibody titers or Ig levels in post-vaccination children were correlated with these environmental exposures; however, the effects of environmental toxicants on post-vaccination antibody potency or Ig levels in children have not been summarized. The objectives of this systematic review are therefore 1) to summarize the current studies concerning the associations of early-life exposure to environmental toxicants with vaccine antibody potency or Ig levels in children; and 2) to analyze the possible mechanisms underlying exposure-related alterations of antibody titers or Ig levels against different vaccines. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature with the key terms and included articles up to September 30, 2020. Based on the eligibility criteria, 28 articles were selected. These studies investigated the associations of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (5 studies), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) (6 studies), other OPs (4 studies), heavy metals (11 studies) and air pollutants, e.g. PM2.5, (3 studies) with the serum-specific antibody concentrations or Ig levels against different vaccines, such as anti-Hib, tetanus, diphtheria toxoid, IgA, IgE, etc. These studies suggest that exposure to these toxicants is generally associated with decreased potency of antibodies produced from childhood immunizations and overall deficiency in vaccines' provided protection. This systematic review provides evidence that exposure-induced changes to humoral immune-related tissue/cells/molecules response to vaccines may play predominant roles in the inverse associations between antibody responsiveness to vaccines and environmental toxicants. This review could thus also help us to conduct better immunization policies for children under environmental toxicant burdens. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Advanced Oxidation Processes Coupled with Nanomaterials for Water
   Treatment
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Water quality management will be a priority issue in the near future. Indeed, due to scarcity and/or contamination of the water, regulatory frameworks will be increasingly strict to reduce environmental impacts of wastewater and to allow water to be reused. Moreover, drinking water quality standards must be improved in order to account for the emerging pollutants that are being detected in tap water. These tasks can only be achieved if new improved and sustainable water treatment technologies are developed. Nanomaterials are improving the ongoing research on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This work reviews the most important AOPs, namely: persulfate, chlorine and NH2Cl based processes, UV/H2O2, Fenton processes, ozone, and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. A critical review of the current coupling of nanomaterials to some of these AOPs is presented. Besides the active role of the nanomaterials in the degradation of water contaminants/pollutants in the AOPs, the relevance of their adsorbent/absorbent function in these processes is also discussed.

TI Understanding the Impact of Perfluorinated Compounds on Cardiovascular
   Diseases and Their Risk Factors: A Meta-Analysis Study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are non-biodegradable synthetic chemical compounds that are widely used in manufacturing many household products. Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta-analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta-analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty-nine articles were included. Our meta-analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z = 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I-2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92-1.58, p < 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z = 4.03, p < 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I-2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00-1.14, p < 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long-term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients.

TI Comparative Assessment of Three Posterior Fossa Decompression Techniques
   and Evaluation of the Evidence Supporting the Efficacy of Syrinx
   Shunting and Filum Terminale Sectioning in Chiari Malformation Type I. A
   Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of posterior fossa decompression (PFD), posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD), and posterior fossa decompression with resection of tonsils (PFDRT) in Chiari malformation type I (CMI). Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy of filum terminale sectioning (FTS), syringosubarachnoid shunting (SSS), and syringoperitoneal shunting (SPS) in CMI.
   METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were screened for English-language studies published from inception until August 11, 2020. A total of 3593 studies were identified through the searching process. Fifteen cohort studies were included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. -
   RESULTS: No studies concerning FTS, SSS, and SPS were found eligible. Therefore, only PFD, PFDD, and PFDRT were compared. PFDD showed significantly higher incidence of complications (relative risk [RR], 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.54-5.64) cerebrospinal fluid leak (RR, 9.74; 95% CI, 2.33-40.78) and neurologic deficit (RR, 8.76; 95% CI, 2.08-36.90) than did PFD. Both PFDD and PFDRT achieved higher syringomyelia improvement (RR, 1.23, 95% CI, 1.09-1.39 and RR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.15-1.51, respectively) and greater clinical improvement (RR, 1.24, 95% CI, 1.10-1.39 and RR, 1.24, 95% CI, 1.08-1.44, respectively) than did PFD. No differences were found between PFDD and PFDRT.
   CONCLUSIONS: PFDD and PFDRTare superior to PFD, especially in patientswith syringomyelia-Chiari complex, because of greater syringomyelia reduction and better clinical improvement. However, PFDD and PFDRT can be considered equally efficient. There is no evidence pleading in favor of SFT, SSS, and SPS over any PFD technique.

TI Recent trends and future challenges of pesticide removal techniques - A
   comprehensive review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Extreme utilization of pesticides for agricultural purposes increases the level of pesticide content in water. Seasonal use of pesticides can cause increased concentrations at potable water abstraction sites as a shock load, which can be difficult for conventional treatment processes to deal with. Choosing the right water treatment method to remove pesticides hangs on the nature of pesticides and the effectiveness of the technique. The focus of this review is to discuss the current developments and progress in the use of various techniques for possible removal of pesticides from wastewater. Some of these processes include advanced oxidation, adsorption, activated sludge treatment, bioreactors and membrane technologies. The solo and mixed treatment techniques have been reviewed in detail and analyzed rigorously. The utilization of hybrid disposal technologies exhibit potential for the development of innovative pesticide removal techniques. Form the process effectiveness point of view, it is very important to thoroughly analyze the composition of the influent and identify the best removal technique. Furthermore, study emphasizes on designing of water treatment plant, the decentralization of water treatment and economical approaches for removal of various types of pesticides from wastewater are discussed.

TI Association between urinary per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances and
   COVID-19 susceptibility
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background and Objective: The growing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency of identifying individuals most at risk of infection. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are manufactured fluorinated chemicals widely used in many industrial and household products. The objective of this case-control study was to assess the association between PFASs exposure and COVID-19 susceptibility and to elucidate the metabolic dysregulation associated with PFASs exposure in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52-3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95-4.83], and total PFASs ( n-ary sumation (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05-4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39-2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71-4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97-3.51] for n-ary sumation (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASsassociated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined beta coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25-0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. Conclusion: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and further understand the underlying mechanisms of PFASs exposure in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection.

TI Sensors for detecting per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A
   critical review of development challenges, current sensors, and
   commercialization obstacles
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of compounds that have become environmental contaminants of emerging concern. They are highly persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, and ubiquitous which makes them important to detect to ensure environmental and human health. Multiple instrument-based methods exist for sensitive and selective detection of PFAS in a variety of matrices, but these methods suffer from expensive costs and the need for a laboratory and highly trained personnel. There is a big need for fast, inexpensive, robust, and portable methods to detect PFAS in the field. This would allow environmental laboratories and other agencies to perform more frequent testing to comply with regulations. In addition, the general public would benefit from a fast method to evaluate the drinking water in their homes for PFAS contamination. A PFAS sensor would provide almost real-time data on PFAS concentrations that can also provide actionable information for water quality managers and consumers around the planet. In this review, we discuss the sensors that have been developed up to this point for PFAS detection by their molecular detection mechanism as well as the goals that should be considered during sensor development. Future research needs and commercialization challenges are also highlighted.

TI A critical review of point-of-use drinking water treatment in the United
   States
SO NPJ CLEAN WATER
AB Ensuring safe water supply for communities across the United States is a growing challenge due to aging infrastructure, impaired source water, strained community finances, etc. In 2019, about 6% of public water utilities in the U.S. had a health-based violation. Due to the high risk of exposure to various contaminants in drinking water, point-of-use (POU) drinking water treatment is rapidly growing in popularity in the U.S. and beyond. POU treatment technologies include various combinations of string-wound sediment filters, activated carbon, modified carbon, ion exchange and redox media filters, reverse osmosis membranes, and ultraviolet lamps depending on the contaminants of concern. While the technologies are well-proven, highly commoditized, and cost-effective, most systems offer little in the way of real-time performance monitoring or interactive technology like other smart home appliances (e.g., thermostats, smoke detectors, doorbells, etc.). Herein, we review water quality regulations and violations in the U.S. as well as state-of-the-art POU technologies and systems with an emphasis on their effectiveness at removing the contaminants most frequently reported in notices of violations. We conclude by briefly reviewing emerging smart water technologies and the needs for advances in the state-of-the-art technologies. The smartness of commercially available POU water filters is critiqued and a definition of smart water filter is proposed.

TI Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals and Risk of Testicular Cancer: A
   Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB The incidence of many hormone-dependent diseases, including testicular cancer, has sharply increased in all high-income countries during the 20th century. This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase (R) was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed.

TI Water Security and Nutrition: Current Knowledge and Research
   Opportunities
SO ADVANCES IN NUTRITION
AB Water is an essential nutrient that has primarily been considered in terms of its physiological necessity. But reliable access to water in sufficient quantities and quality is also critical for many nutrition-related behaviors and activities, including growing and cooking diverse foods. Given growing challenges to water availability and safety, including climate change, pollution, and infrastructure degradation, a broader conceptualization of water and its diverse uses is needed to sustainably achieve global nutrition targets. Therefore, we review empirical and qualitative evidence describing the linkages between water security (the reliable availability, accessibility, and quality of water for all household uses) and nutrition. Primary linkages include water security for drinking, food production and preparation, infant and young child feeding, and limiting exposure to pathogens and environmental toxins. We then identify knowledge gaps within each linkage and propose a research agenda for studying water security and nutrition going forward, including the concurrent quantification of both food and water availability, accessibility, use, and stability. By making explicit the connections between water security and nutritional well-being, we aim to promote greater collaboration between the nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Interdisciplinary policies and programs that holistically address the water-nutrition nexus, versus those that focus on water and nutrition independently, are likely to significantly advance our ability to ensure equitable access to healthy foods and safe water for all.

TI Anion exchange resin removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS) from impacted water: A critical review
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB A key gap in the literature on the treatment of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in impacted water is the absence of a review article dedicated to anion exchange resin (AER) treatment. This gap is important because previous research has consistently shown adsorption by AER to be one of the most effective treatment processes for PFAS removal from impacted water, and AER is one of the most commonly deployed technologies in the field. Given the scope of the previous review articles on PFAS removal by various adsorbent types, the sections on AER do not explore the full depth of PFAS and AER interactions nor cover the breadth of AER testing conditions. Accordingly, the goal of this paper was to critically review the available peer-reviewed literature on PFAS removal from water by AER. The specific objectives of the review were to synthesize the previous literature results on (1) batch adsorption behavior, (2) impact of water chemistry conditions, (3) continuous-flow adsorption, (4) adsorption modeling, (5) regeneration, and (6) weak-base AER. Following from critical review of the literature, the future research priorities discussed include: (i) improving the underlying science that governs PFAS-resin interactions, (ii) improving methods for resin regeneration and management of PFAS-contaminated concentrate streams, and (iii) comparative life cycle environmental and economic analyses for ion exchange treatment systems relative to competing technologies.

TI Synthesis, structure, and performance of carbide phases in
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: A critical review
SO FUEL
AB Iron carbides are of burgeoning interest in both fundamental scientific research and fuel technology due to their electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties. They are arguably connected with the active phase in iron-based Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). In FTS, different phases of iron carbide have been identified, including Ha?gg carbide (?-Fe5C2), pseudo-hexagonal iron carbide (?-Fe2.2C), hexagonal iron carbide (?-Fe3C), cementite (?-Fe3C), and Eckstrom-Adcock iron carbide (Fe7C3). However, despite decades of existence of FTS technology, the exact roles played by carbide phases have been the subject of intense debate due to the complex and dynamic nature of carbide phases. This drawback usually frustrates the establishment of a clear-cut structure-perfomance relationship. In light of these concerns, it is very imperative to critically review the challenges and various approaches aimed at demystifying their roles and improving their performance in FTS for sustainable production of clean fuels. First, the structures and essential properties of iron carbides were evaluated and recent research advances in the synthesis of iron carbides were discussed and compared. Second, the structural elucidations of carbide phases using in situ studies, their performances and thermodynamic stability in FT reaction were discussed. Finally, outlooks on future research directions are outlined. This review provides insights into understanding the evolution and performance of carbide phases in FTS, and motivating researchers to further contribute towards designing iron-based FTS catalysts with highly active and selective carbide phase as the predominant phase.

TI A Comprehensive Non-targeted Analysis Study of the Prenatal Exposome
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent technological advances in mass spectrometry have enabled us to screen biological samples for a very broad spectrum of chemical compounds allowing us to more comprehensively characterize the human exposome in critical periods of development. The goal of this study was three-fold: (1) to analyze 590 matched maternal and cord blood samples (total 295 pairs) using non-targeted analysis (NTA); (2) to examine the differences in chemical abundance between maternal and cord blood samples; and (3) to examine the associations between exogenous chemicals and endogenous metabolites. We analyzed all samples with high-resolution mass spectrometry using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) in both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes (ESI+ and ESI-) and in soft ionization (MS) and fragmentation (MS/MS) modes for prioritized features. We confirmed 19 unique compounds with analytical standards, we tentatively identified 73 compounds with MS/MS spectra matching, and we annotated 98 compounds using an annotation algorithm. We observed 103 significant associations in maternal and 128 in cord samples between compounds annotated as endogenous and compounds annotated as exogenous. An example of these relationships was an association between three poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and endogenous fatty acids in both the maternal and cord samples indicating potential interactions between PFASs and fatty acid regulating proteins.

Sequence analysis revealed that EstXT1 belonged to the family VIII carboxylesterases and contained a characteristic conserved S-x-x-K motif and a deduced catalytic triad Ser56-Lys59-Tyr165. EstXT1 exhibited the strongest activity toward methyl ferulate at pH 8.0 and temperature 55 degrees C and retained over 80% of its original activity after incubation in the pH range of 7.0-10.6 buffers. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme showed that it was activated by Zn2+ and Co2+ metal ion, while inhibited by Cu2+ and CTAB. EstXT1 exhibited significant promiscuous acyltransferase activity preferred to the acylation of benzyl alcohol acceptor using short-chain pNP-esters (C2-C8) as acyl-donors. A structure-function analysis indicated that a WAG motif is essential to acyltransferase activity. This is the first report example that WAG motif plays a pivotal role in acyltransferase activity in family VIII carboxylesterases beside WGG motif. Further experiment indicated that EstXT1 successfully acylated cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in aqueous solution. The results from the current investigation provided new insights for the family VIII carboxylesterase and lay a foundation for the potential applications of EstXT1 in food and biotechnology fields.

TI The relationship between maternal perfluoroalkylated substances exposure
   and low birth weight of offspring: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Some studies have shown that maternal perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) exposure may be associated with low birth weight (LBW) of offspring. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between maternal PFASs exposure and LBW in offspring. The researchers searched PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase to find all the articles before October 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Finally, six articles were included for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed no significant correlation between maternal perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and LBW of offspring: odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.80-1.01, with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 18.4%, P = 0.289); there was a significant positive correlation between maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and LBW of offspring (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09-1.55) with no heterogeneity (I-2 = 0.00%, P = 0.570). The grouping analysis of PFOS showed was a significant positive correlation between maternal PFOS exposure and LBW of offspring in American (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15-1.72). This study provided a systematic review and meta-analysis evidence for the relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and LBW of offspring through a small number of studies. Researchers should conduct further studies between different regions.

TI The association between maternal perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and
   early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children: a systematic
   review and meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Some studies have shown that maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may be associated with early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to verify this association by reviewing existing studies and to provide a strong basis for preventing ADHD. The researchers searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase for all studies published before October 2020. Finally, we included nine articles for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal exposure to PFASs was not significantly associated with the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75-1.25; perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88-1.14; perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.80-1.09; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99-1.28; perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.15-2.32). Due to significant heterogeneity, we subsequently performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children's blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable. In conclusion, a causal relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and ADHD in children was unlikely. Among them, PFOS, PFNA, and ADHD might have positive associations worthy of further investigation.

TI Research Progress on On-Chip Fourier Transform Spectrometer
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB A Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is recognized as a highly precise analytical instrument for analyzing the constituent elements of matter in the fields of physics, chemistry, aerospace, and so on. With the emergence and development of miniaturized and portable devices in numerous scientific and technological fields, there has been an urgent need for on-chip FTSs due to their benefits of small size, portability, low energy consumption, and robustness. However, the small size of on-chip FTSs hinders the acquisition of a large optical path difference, resulting in a low resolution of the spectrometer. In addition, the sampler spacing is not sufficiently small to satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, directly influencing the bandwidth of the spectrometer. Therefore, studies have been performed to investigate the trade-off between the reduced size and performance of spectrometers. This paper aims to systematically review the progress in on-chip FTSs, especially in on-chip static FTSs, including spatially modulated, temporally modulated, and space-time comodulated FTSs, from the aspects of theories, implementations, and performance indicators. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of the challenges and a view of the prospective development of this exciting field.

TI Carbon xerogels combined with nanotubes as solid-phase extraction
   sorbent to determine metaflumizone and seven other surface and drinking
   water micropollutants
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Carbon xerogels (CXs) were synthesized by polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde, followed by thermal annealing, and subjected to hydrothermal oxidation. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were filled with CXs and tested for extraction of metaflumizone and other seven environmental micropollutants (acetamiprid, atrazine, isoproturon, methiocarb, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) before chromatographic analysis. The recoveries obtained with the pristine CX were low for most analytes, except for metaflumizone (69 +/- 5%). Moreover, it was concluded that the adsorption/desorption process of the micropollutants performed better on CXs with a less acidic surface (i.e., pristine CX). Thus, cartridges were prepared with pristine CX and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a multi-layer configuration. This reusable cartridge was able to simultaneously extract the eight micropollutants and was used to validate an analytical methodology based on SPE followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A widespread occurrence of 6/8 target compounds was observed in surface water collected in rivers supplying three drinking water treatment plants and in the resulting drinking water at the endpoint of each distribution system. Therefore, the first study employing CXs and MWCNTs as sorbent in multi-layer SPE cartridges is herein reported as a proof of concept for determination of multi-class water micropollutants.

TI Cement augmentation of internal fixation for trochanteric fracture: a
   systematic review and meta-analysis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB Purpose This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of cement augmentation for internally fixed trochanteric fractures through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to identify RCTs, published until July 2020 that examined the effects of cement augmentation of internal fixation of trochanteric fractures. The primary outcomes were reoperation and Parker Mobility Score, whereas the secondary outcomes were 1-year mortality rate, EuroQol 5 Dimension, fixation failures, and adverse events. We conducted meta-analyses of the outcome measures using the random-effects models. We evaluated the certainty of evidence based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results We included three RCTs (326 participants). No significant effect was observed in favor of cement augmentation on all these outcomes. The certainty of evidence for fixation failures was very low and that for the other outcomes was low. The overall risk of bias for each outcome was high or of some concern in all included studies. Conclusions The effect of cement augmentation of internal fixation of trochanteric fractures was uncertain for the clinical outcomes due to the low certainty of evidence. Further RCTs with a low risk of selection bias may present convincing conclusions on the efficacy and safety of cement augmentation.

TI A Roadmap to the Structure-Related Metabolism Pathways of Per- and
   Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in the Early Life Stages of Zebrafish (Danio
   rerio)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Thousands of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with diverse structures have been detected in the ambient environment. Apart from a few well-studied PFAS, the structure-related toxicokinetics of a broader set of PFAS remain unclear.
   OBJECTIVES: To understand the toxicokinetics of PFAS, we attempted to characterize the metabolism pathways of 74 structurally diverse PFAS sam -ples from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's PFAS screening library.
   METHODS: Using the early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we determined the bioconcentration factors and phenotypic toxicities of 74 PFAS. Then, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based nontargeted analysis to identify metabolites of PFAS in zebrafish larvae after 5 d of exposure by incorporating retention time and mass spectra. In vitro enzymatic activity experiments with human recombinant liver carboxyles-terase (hCES1) were employed to validate the structure-related hydrolysis of 11 selected PFAS.
   RESULTS: Our findings identified five structural categories of PFAS prone to metabolism. The metabolism pathways of PFAS were highly related to their structures as exemplified by fluorotelomer alcohols that the predominance of beta-oxidation or taurine conjugation pathways were primarily determined by the number of hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis was identified as a major metabolism pathway for diverse PFAS, and perfluoroalkyl carboxamides showed the highest in vivo hydrolysis rates, followed by carboxyesters and sulfonamides. The hydrolysis of PFAS was verified with recombinant hCES1, with strong substrate preferences toward perfluoroalkyl carboxamides.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the roadmap of the structure-related metabolism pathways of PFAS established in this study would provide a starting point to inform the potential health risks of other PFAS.

TI Emerging pollutants in Nigeria: A systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Emerging pollutants represent a group of synthetic or naturally occurring compounds that are not normally monitored within the environment but can enter into the environment and cause different adverse ecological and health effects. This systematic review identified the various emerging pollutants in Nigeria. The following databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) were searched to identify studies on pollutants of emerging concerns in Nigeria. A total of 933 articles were identified out of which 30 articles were selected to be eligible for the study. Over 250 emerging pollutants were identified and divided into 9 major groups which are personal care products, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, mycotoxins, radionuclides and electromagnetic radiations (Gamma radiation) and other pollutants of emerging concerns such as microbes, microplastics, and particulate matter. These pollutants are found in water bodies and underground waters, soils and sediments, biological systems, and ambient air at different concentrations with seasonal variations. Some of these pollutants act as endocrine disruptors, beta-adrenergic receptors agonist blockers, oxidative stress inducers and can cause genetic alterations in DNA and epigenetic reprogramming through global DNA methylation, gene-specific CpG methylation and microRNA expression. Emerging pollutants of public health concern in Nigeria are on the increase and are threat to both ecological and human health.

TI Onlay Patellofemoral Arthroplasty in Patients With Isolated
   Patellofemoral Arthritis: A Systematic Review
SO JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY
AB Background: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) remains controversial due to variable postoperative outcomes and high failure rates. Second-generation (2G) onlay prostheses have been associated with improved postoperative outcomes. This systematic review was performed to assess the current overall survivorship and functional outcomes of 2G PFA.
   Methods: A search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies published in the last 15 years (2005-2020) were included; of these 22 studies reported patient-reported outcome measures. Operative and nonoperative complications were analyzed. Pooled statistical analysis was performed for survivorship and functional scores using Excel 2016 and Stata 13.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.7. When analyzing all studies, weighted survival at mean follow-up of 5.52 was 87.72%. Subanalysis of studies with minimum 5 years of follow up showed a survival of 94.24%. Fifteen studies reported Oxford Knee Score with a weighted mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score of 33.59. Mean American Knee Society Score pain was 79.7 while mean American Knee Society Score function was 79.3. The most common operative complication was OA progression for all implants. The percentage of revisions and conversions reported after analyzing all studies was 1.37% and 7.82% respectively.
   Conclusion: Safe and acceptable results of functional outcomes and PFA survivorship can result from 2G PFAs at both short and mid-term follow-up for patients with isolated patellofemoral OA. However, longterm follow-up outcomes are still pending for the newer implants. More extensive studies using standardized functional outcomes and long-term cost benefits should be evaluated.

TI A review of the occurrence, transformation, and removal of poly- and
   perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in wastewater treatment plants
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise more than 4,00 0 anthropogenically manufactured compounds with widescale consumer and industrial applications. This critical review compiles the latest information on the worldwide distribution of PFAS and evaluates their fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). A large proportion (>30%) of monitoring studies in WWTPs were conducted in China, followed by Europe (30%) and North America (16%), whereas information is generally lacking for other parts of the world, including most of the developing countries. Short and long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were widely detected in both the influents (up to 1,00 0 ng/L) and effluents (15 to >1,500 ng/L) of WWTPs. To date, limited data is available regarding levels of PFAS precursors and ultra-short chain PFAS in WWTPs. Most WWTPs exhibited low removal efficiencies for PFAS, and many studies reported an increase in the levels of PFAAs after wastewater treatment. The analysis of the fate of various classes of PFAS at different wastewater treatment stages (aerobic and/aerobic biodegradation, photodegradation, and chemical degradation) revealed biodegradation as the primary mechanism responsible for the transformation of PFAS precursors to PFAAs in WWTPs. Remediation studies at full scale and laboratory scale suggest advanced processes such as adsorption using ion exchange resins, electrochemical degradation, and nanofiltration are more effective in removing PFAS (similar to 95-100%) than conventional processes. However, the applicability of such treatments for real-world WWTPs faces significant challenges due to the scaling-up requirements, mass-transfer limitations, and management of treatment by-products and wastes. Combining more than one technique for effective removal of PFAS, while addressing limitations of the individual treatments, could be beneficial. Considering environmental concentrations of PFAS, cost-effectiveness, and ease of operation, nanofiltration followed by adsorption using wood-derived biochar and/or activated carbons could be a viable option if introduced to conventional treatment systems. However, the large-scale applicability of the same needs to be further verified. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Comparative analysis of the physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and
   toxicological properties of ether-PFAS
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Perfluoropolyethers, also known as ether-PFAS, are linear or branched alkyl ether polymers, where the substituent hydrogens on the carbon atoms in the chain have been fully replaced by fluorine atoms. Some of these molecules may have a carboxylate functional group attached to one of the terminal carbon atoms to form an ether-PFAS carboxylate. Perfluoropolyethers are used as processing aids in the manufacture of various types of perfluorinated polymeric materials which are used in a variety of consumer applications. Although the physicochemical and toxicological properties of certain perfluoropolyether compounds have been extensively studied, data are relatively sparse for some members of this class of compounds. Moreover, the physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and toxicological properties of ether-PFAS as a class have not been elucidated in previous comprehensive review articles. This article reviews the nomenclature and uses of ether-PFAS and compares the physicochemical properties, toxicokinetic characteristics, apical effects in toxicological studies, and doseresponse profiles across four specific ether-PFAS compounds. This comparison, including a description of identified data gaps should help to inform the design of studies to further elucidate the characteristics of etherPFAS and to propose potential read-across assessment strategies for members of this class.

TI Nanoremediation technologies for sustainable remediation of contaminated
   environments: Recent advances and challenges
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB A major and growing concern within society is the lack of innovative and effective solutions to mitigate the challenge of environmental pollution. Uncontrolled release of pollutants into the environment as a result of urbanisation and industrialisation is a staggering problem of global concern. Although, the eco-toxicity of nanotechnology is still an issue of debate, however, nanoremediation is a promising emerging technology to tackle environmental contamination, especially dealing with recalcitrant contaminants. Nanoremediation represents an innovative approach for safe and sustainable remediation of persistent organic compounds such as pesticides, chlorinated solvents, brominated or halogenated chemicals, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and heavy metals.

TI A critical review on surface-pattern engineering of nafion membrane for
   fuel cell applications
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Surface-pattern engineering, as a key strategy to fabricate high-performance Nafion membranes for fuel cells, plays an important role in surface functionalization of the membrane, optimization of the three-phase boundary, water management, proton transport, etc. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to developing advancedpatterned Nafion membranes with single-scale (nanoscale or microscale) and multiscale-patterned structures which are believed to improve the performance of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for fuel cells. In this review, the recent progress in surface-patterned Nafion membranes (SPNMs) equipped with single-scalepatterned structures (including nanostructured and microstructured Nafion membranes) is firstly highlighted. The structural features and construction methods of SPNMs are discussed in detail. The effects of single-scale SPNMs on the construction and performance of fuel cells are also analyzed. Followed is an overview of the recent advances in fabricating multiscale SPNMs based on different strategies with a specific introduction on the membrane related effects on fuel cells. Finally, the future development direction and certain perspectives on the current issues of SPNMs are presented.

   Polymeric gas separation membranes have become a competent technology over the past few decades. This review focuses on the broad classifications of membrane materials and the criteria for the selection of membrane materials, describes the various synthesis routes adopted for membrane fabrication, and explains various gas transport mechanisms. A comparison of membrane-based separation technology with other conventional technologies has also been made. The review also discusses the current polymers used for gas separations, current commercially viable membrane-based gas separation processes, and various limitations associated with the development of membrane material and separation processes. Further, various new classes of membranes developed for gas separations, including thermally rearranged polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity, room temperature ionic liquids, perfluoro polymers, and mixed matrix membranes, that has high separation performance has also been discussed. Some of the emerging membrane-based gas separations are also reviewed.

TI Epigenetic changes by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Increasing studies are examining per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) induced toxicity and resulting health outcomes, including epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifi-cation, microRNA expression). We critically reviewed current evidence from human epidemiological, in vitro, and animal studies, including mammalian and aquatic model organisms. Epidemiological studies identified the associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure and epigenetic changes in both adult populations and birth cohorts. For in vitro studies, various cell types including neuroblasts, preadipocytes, and hepatocytes have been employed to understand epigenetic effects of PFAS. In studies with animal models, effects of early life exposure to PFAS have been examined using rodent models, and aquatic models (e.g., zebrafish) have been more frequently used in recent years. Several studies highlighted oxidative stress as a key mediator between epigenetic modi-fication and health effects. Collectively, previous research clearly suggest involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in PFAS induced toxicity, though these efforts have primarily focused on specific PFASs (i.e. mainly PFOS and PFOA) or endpoints (i.e. cancer). Additional studies are necessary to define specific linkages among epigenetic mechanisms and related biomarkers or phenotypical changes. In addition, future research is also needed for understudied PFAS and complex mixtures. Studies of epigenetic effects elicited by individual PFAS and mixtures are needed within an adverse outcome pathways framework, which will advance an understanding of PFAS risks to public health and the environment, and support efforts to design less hazardous chemicals.

TI Photocatalytic membranes: a new perspective for persistent organic
   pollutants removal
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The presence of conventional and emerging pollutants infiltrating into our water bodies is a course of concern as they have seriously threatened water security. Established techniques such as photocatalysis and membrane technology have proven to be promising in removing various persistent organic pollutants (POP) from wastewaters. The emergence of hybrid photocatalytic membrane which incorporates both photocatalysis and membrane technology has shown greater potential in treating POP laden wastewater based on their synergistic effects. This article provides an in-depth review on the roles of both photocatalysis and membrane technology in hybrid photocatalytic membranes for the treatment of POP containing wastewaters. A concise introduction on POP's in terms of examples, their origins and their effect on a multitude of organisms are critically reviewed. The fundamentals of photocatalytic mechanism, current directions in photocatalyst design and their employment to treat POP's are also discussed. Finally, the challenges and future direction in this field are presented.

TI Technologies towards antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) removal from
   aquatic environment: A critical review
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been recognized as emerging pollutants that are widely distributed and accumulated in most of aquatic environment. Although many ARGs-removal technologies are employed, a corresponding discussion of merits and limitations of known technologies is still currently lacking. More importantly, the removal mechanisms of ARGs remain unclear, hindering their ecological feasibility. Thus, further in-depth studies are highly required. In this review, the occurrence and risk of ARGs in aquatic environment are introduced, and the main routes and potential impacts of ARGs dissemination are enumerated. In addition, several novel ARGs detection methods are critically reviewed. Notably, to ensure greater applicability of these technologies, systematic information on how recent technologies impact the ARGs removal and control are comprehensively compared and summarized. Finally, future research directions to alleviate the risk of ARGs in aquatic environment are briefly introduced. Taken together, this review provides useful information to facilitate the development of innovative and feasible ARGs removal technologies and increase their economic viability and ecological sustainability.

TI Perfluorobutane contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for the diagnosis of
   HCC: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY
AB Objectives Perfluorobutane ultrasound contrast agent as a new type of contrast agent has a good performance in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aim to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of Perfluorobutane contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (P-CEUS) in the diagnosis of HCC with a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Clinical Key, Wan Fang, CBM and CNKI databases were systematically searched and checked for studies using P-CEUS in HCC, from 2007 to 2020. Data necessary to construct 2 x 2 contingency tables were extracted from included studies. The QUADAS tool was utilized to assess the methodologic quality of the studies. Meta-analysis included data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression and investigation of publication bias was comprehensively performed. Results Nine studies were included in this meta-analysis and the overall diagnostic accuracy in characterization of HCC was as follows: pooled sensitivity, 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.95); pooled specificity, 0.97 (0.93-0.98); pooled positive likelihood ratio, 27.2 (14.1 to - 52.3); and pooled negative likelihood ratio, 0.10 (0.06-0.18). The area under the comprehensive receiving operation characteristic curve was 0.98 (0.97-0.99). Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of P-CEUS are more valuable than other imaging techniques (such as computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). However, due to the large differences in the data samples collected in this study, statistical heterogeneity results. P-CEUS can significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency of previous contrast-enhanced ultrasound for HCC. PROSPERO registration number: PROSPERO (CRD42020200040).

TI Critical review on PFOA, kidney cancer, and testicular cancer
SO JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
AB The carcinogenicity of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been reviewed previously by several different regulatory agencies and researchers, with contradictory conclusions-especially regarding epidemiological findings on kidney cancer and testicular cancer. In addition, previous dose-response assessments have focused primarily on evidence from animal studies. This critical review summarizes peer reviewed epidemiological studies on PFOA and cancers of the kidneys and testes, using modified Hill's criteria to assess the evidence for causation. We converted exposures to a common scale based on serum PFOA concentrations and applied meta-analysis to estimate the average increase in cancer risk reported by the studies with sufficient information to estimate serum PFOA. Using random effects meta-analysis, we found that the average relative increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for these studies is 16% (95% CI: 3%, 30%) for kidney cancer and 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) for testicular cancer. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies.
   Implications: Our review meta-analysis indicates an average increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL increase in serum PFOA for kidney and testicular cancers. These associations are most likely causal, but results are limited by the small number of studies for testicular cancer, the overlapping study populations for several studies, and the lack of measured or modeled serum PFOA concentrations for several studies. The weight of evidence could be even stronger with the addition of future studies conducted in large cohorts.

TI The short-term effectiveness and safety of second-generation
   patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty on isolated
   patellofemoral osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB BackgroundWe aimed to compare second-generation patellofemoral arthroplasty (2G PFA) with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in treating isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) by assessing the percentages of revisions, complications, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).MethodsStudies that compared the outcomes of 2G PFA and TKA in the treatment of isolated PFOA were searched in electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Two researchers independently identified eligible studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the quality of the literature. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either fixed or random effects models. Descriptive analysis was used when data could not be pooled.ResultsA total of six studies were included in the review. For the revision percentage and complications, there were no significant differences between 2G PFA and TKA (RR = 2.29, 95% CI 0.69-7.58, P = 0.17; RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.23-1.40, P = 0.22, respectively). Second, the results demonstrated that the differences in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score between 2G PFA and TKA were not significant (WMD -4.68, 95% CI -16.32 to 6.97, p = 0.43; WMD 0.16, 95% CI -1.21 to 1.53, P = 0.82). The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the American Knee Society Score (AKSS), and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were presented in a narrative form due to methodological heterogeneity.ConclusionFor isolated PFOA, 2G PFA demonstrated similar results to TKA with respect to the percentages of revisions, complications, and PROMs.

TI Application of TiO2-Based Photocatalysts to Antibiotics Degradation:
   Cases of Sulfamethoxazole, Trimethoprim and Ciprofloxacin
SO CATALYSTS
AB The extensive application of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to their widespread occurrence in a natural aquatic environment. Global health crisis is associated with the fast development of antimicrobial resistance, as more and more infectious diseases cannot be treated more than once. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin are the most commonly detected antibiotics in water systems worldwide. The persistent and toxic nature of these antibiotics makes their elimination by conventional treatment methods at wastewater treatment plants almost impossible. The application of advanced oxidation processes and heterogeneous photocatalysis over TiO2-based materials is a promising solution. This highly efficient technology has the potential to be sustainable, cost-efficient and energy-efficient. A comprehensive review on the application of various TiO2-based photocatalysts for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin is focused on highlighting their photocatalytic performance under various reaction conditions (different amounts of pollutant and photocatalyst, pH, light source, reaction media, presence of inorganic ions, natural organic matter, oxidants). Mineralization efficiency and ecotoxicity of final products have been also considered. Further research needs have been presented based on the literature findings. Among them, design and development of highly efficient under sunlight, stable, recyclable and cost-effective TiO2-based materials; usage of real wastewaters for photocatalytic tests; and compulsory assessment of products ecotoxicity are the most important research tasks in order to meet requirements for industrial application.

TI Fate and transport of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the
   vadose zone
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a heterogeneous group of persistent organic pollutants that have been detected in various environmental compartments around the globe. Emerging research has revealed the preferential accumulation of PFASs in shallow soil horizons, particularly at sites impacted by firefighting activities, agricultural applications, and atmospheric deposition. Once in the vadose zone, PFASs can sorb to soil, accumulate at interfaces, become volatilized, be taken up in biota, or leach to the underlying aquifer. At the same time, polyfluorinated precursor species may transform into highly recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl acids, changing their chemical identity and thus transport behavior along the way. In this review, we critically discuss the current state of the knowledge and aim to interconnect the complex processes that control the fate and transport of PFASs in the vadose zone. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future research needs. Consequently, this review may serve as an interdisciplinary guide for the risk assessment and management of PFAScontaminated sites.

TI Biocompatibility of intraocular liquid tamponade agents: an update
SO EYE
AB Intraocular liquids tamponade agents, such as perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCLs), semifluorinated alkanes (SFAs), silicone oils (SOs) and heavy silicone oils (HSOs), are a crucial intraoperative and/or postoperative tool in vitreoretinal surgery, in particular for the management of complex vitreoretinal diseases. However, their use is not without complications, which are potentially severe. Consequently, a growing interest has been devoted to the biocompatibility of these compounds and the adequacy of current regulations that should guarantee their safety. Obviously, an updated knowledge on research findings and potential risks associated to the use of intraocular liquid compounds is essential, not only for vitreoretinal surgeons, but also for any ophthalmologist involved in the management of patients receiving intraocular liquid tamponades. In light of this, the review provides a comprehensive characterisation of intraocular liquid tamponades, in terms of physical and chemical properties, current clinical use and possible complications. Moreover, this review focuses on the safety profile of these compounds, summarising the existing regulation and the available evidence on their biocompatibility.

TI To which extent are per-and poly-fluorinated substances associated to
   metabolic syndrome?
SO REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings.

TI Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) caused oxidative stress and metabolic
   disorders in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) root
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Eliminating the critical knowledge gaps of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) effects in planta is the imperative target to accomplish accurate and meaningful exposure-risk assessment in the environment. Here, we investigated the effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA on the oxidative stress and metabolic regulation in lettuce (Lamas saliva) root. Under the exposure to 5 and 50 mu g/L PFOA for 10days, 137.5 and 1275.0 ng PFOA/g dry weight were accumulated to roots, respectively. H2O2. the dominant reactive oxygen species, was slightly overgenerated by 4.7%-9.5%. No signs of oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation, cell membrane integrity and soluble protein content, were observed. To deal with PFOA stress, the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase and the contents of glutathione were dose-dependently up-regulated. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed metabolite profiles were significantly altered by PFOA, involving the primary metabolism (e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose-6-phosphate, methionine, gamma-aminobutyric acid), and the biosynthesis of (poly) phenol (e.g., shikimate, naringenin) and alkaloid (e.g., geranyl diphosphate, dopamine). Our findings showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA significantly perturbed metabolisms in plant roots albeit no remarkable cell damage was induced. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI C-13 isotope-based metabolic flux analysis revealing cellular landscape
   of glucose metabolism in human liver cells exposed to perfluorooctanoic
   acid
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is well known to break glucose homeostasis. However, the effects of PFOA on glucose metabolism are difficult to be evaluated because related metabolites may be synthesized from other nutritional substrates. Here, the relative contribution of glucose to metabolites (e.g., pyruvate and citrate) in the PFOA-treated human liver cells (HepG2) was determined using the C-13 isotope-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA), i.e., pathway activities. The relative percentage of [U-C-13(6)] glucose-derived pyruvate in cells exposed to PFOA was not significantly different from that in the controls, indicating that the metabolic pattern of glycolysis was not substantially changed by PFOA. The pathway activity of [U-C-13(6)] glucose-driven tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was dramatically inhibited by PFOA. Consequently, mitochondrial respiratory function was phenotypically impaired by PFOA, as observed from the decreasing basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP-linked OCR and spare respiratory capacity. This study suggests that PFOA may cause the abnormal glucose metabolism via altering the metabolic pattern of TCA cycle instead of glycolysis. The MFA is strongly recommended as a promising and robust tool to address the toxicity mechanisms of contaminants associated with glucose metabolism. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Fingerprinting Plastic-Associated Inorganic and Organic Matter on
   Plastic Aged in the Marine Environment for a Decade
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The long-term aging of plastic leads to weathering and biofouling that can influence the behavior and fate of plastic in the marine environment. This is the first study to fingerprint the contaminant profiles and bacterial communities present in plastic-associated inorganic and organic matter (PIOM) isolated from 10 year-aged plastic. Plastic sleeves were sampled from an oyster aquaculture farm and the PIOM was isolated from the intertidal, subtidal, and sediment-buried segments to investigate the levels of metal(loid)s, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and explore the microbial community composition. Results indicated that the PIOM present on long-term aged high-density polyethylene plastic harbored high concentrations of metal(loid)s, PAHs, and PFAS. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the bacterial composition in the PIOM differed by habitat type, which consisted of potentially pathogenic taxa including Vibrio, Shewanella, and Psychrobacter. This study provides new insights into PIOM as a potential sink for hazardous environmental contaminants and its role in enhancing the vector potential of plastic. Therefore, we recommend the inclusion of PIOM analysis in current biomonitoring regimes and that plastics be used with caution in aquaculture settings to safeguard valuable food resources, particularly in areas of point-source contamination.

TI Organic farming: Does it contribute to contaminant-free produce and
   ensure food safety?
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Organic farming for higher ecological and human health benefits has been adopted in about 186 countries, covering a total area of 71.5 Mha worldwide. Because of the associated practices, the flows of several environmental pollutants into the organic products threaten food safety and human health. The contaminants that occur at higher concentrations in organic produce include persistent organic pollutants (61.3-436.9 ng g(-1) lamb meat, and 0.28 pg g(-1)-2.75 ng g(-1) bovine meat), heavy metals (05-33.0 mg kg(-1) lettuce), organochlorine pesticides (11-199 mu g g(-1) carrots). cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromocyclododecane (2-3 times higher than in conventionally produced porcine meat), hexachlorobenzene (138-14.49 ng g(-1) fat in milk), and non-brominated flame retardants (1.3-3.2 times higher than in conventional produce of greenhouse-grown tomato and cucumber). Moreover, some pollutants like per- and polyfluoroallcyl substances with a longer half-life (1.50-9.10 yrs) are reported to occur in several organic products. In fact, several legacy persistent organic pollutants are known for their significant trophic magnification in an urban terrestrial ecosystem. In addition, many plant functional ides are adversely affected in organic farming. Therefore, the long-term usage of organic products containing such pollutants poses a significant threat to human health. The major limitation in organic livestock production is the severe shortage of organic feed. Several variable standards and technical regulations set by the government and private agencies are the major obstacles in the global marketing of organic products. The present review critically addresses the impact of organic farming on hidden risks due to the use of composts as the amendment resources that enhance the phytoaccumulation and trophic transfer of pollutants, the functional diversity of the ecosystems, and poor harmonization among the policies and regulations in different countries for organic farming. The future directions of research have been suggested to mitigate unintended flows of pollutants into the organic products. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Combined effects of polyethylene and organic contaminant on zebrafish
   (Danio rerio): Accumulation of 9-Nitroanthracene, biomarkers and
   intestinal microbiota
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Microplastics, as emerging pollutant, are predicted to act as carriers for organic pollutants, but the carrier role and bio-toxic effects with other pollutants in environments are poorly acknowledged. In this study, both the single and combined effects of polyethylene (PE, 10 and 40 mg/L) with the particle size of 100 -150 mm and 9-Nitroanthracene (9-NAnt, 5 and 500 mg/L) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) had been investigated. The results illustrated that PE could be as 9-NAnt carrier to enter into zebrafish body, but significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of 9-NAnt, due to the occurrence of adsorption interactions between the simultaneous presence of both PE and 9-NAnt. After 4 days, the enzymes activity of cytochrome P4501A, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the abundance of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxide (LPO) responded strongly to low-dose PE exposure (10 mg/L). After 7 days exposure to PE-9-NAnt (40 mg/L), the P4501A activity increased significantly, but the activities of AChE and LDH were inhibited clearly, causing certain neurotoxicity and disorders of energy metabolism to zebrafish. The analysis of integrated biomarker response index (IBR) suggested that PE had greater bio-toxicity to zebrafish in all exposure groups after short-term exposure, but the PE-9-NAnt complex showed greater bio-toxicity after 7 days, which indicated that complex exposure of PE-9-NAnt had a delayed effect on the bio-toxicity of zebrafish. Furthermore, analysis of the intestinal microbiota exhibited that under the conditions of the exposure group with 9-NAnt, the relative abundance of the five dominant bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota) changed greatly. Overall, this study confirmed that PE could carry 9-NAnt into fish causing bioaccumulation, but in the case of coexisting exposures, PE reduced 9-NAnt bioaccumulation, suggesting that microplastics with other emerging pollutants in chronic toxicity are probably next objects in future works.

TI Current Situation and Challenges in Vitreous Substitutes
SO MACROMOLECULAR BIOSCIENCE
AB Vitreo-retinal disorders constitute a significant portion of treatable ocular diseases. These pathologies often require vitreo-retinal surgery and, as a consequence, the use of vitreous substitutes. Nowadays, the vitreous substitutes that are used in clinical practice are mainly divided into gases (air, SF6, C2F6, C3F8) and liquids (perfluorocarbon liquids, silicone oils, and heavy silicone oils). There are specific advantages and drawbacks to each of these, which determine their clinical indications. However, developing the ideal biomaterial for vitreous substitution continues to be one of the most important challenges in ophthalmology, and a multidisciplinary approach is required. In this sense, recent research has focused on the development of biocompatible, biodegradable, and injectable hydrogels (natural, synthetic, and smart), which also act as medium and long-term internal tamponade agents. This comprehensive review aims to cover the main characteristics and indications for use of the extensive range of vitreous substitutes that are currently used in clinical practice, before going on to describe the hydrogels that have been developed recently and which have emerged as promising biomaterials for vitreous substitution.

TI Microbiological Analysis of Two Deep Constructed Wetlands with Special
   Emphasis on the Removal of Pathogens and Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB With the global concern on the role of wastewater treatment technologies in manifesting the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), it has now become imperative to analyze the emerging technologies for handling them. This study assesses the efficiency of two deep constructed wetlands (CWs) receiving partially treated sewage from a residential complex and a hospital designed for the removal of organics and pathogens. These systems were further analyzed for the presence of major ARB to identify the role of CWs in mitigating antibiotic resistance among microbial communities. The bacterial community responsible for metabolic conversions was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. Finally, the efficiencies of deep CWs were analyzed for the removal of specific bacteria resistant to three antibiotics-piperacillin, colistin (polymixin E), and cefoperazone. The overall removal of extended spectrum beta lactamase producers and carbapenemase producers was also studied. Our results indicate that CWs offer decent BOD and COD removal efficiencies of 74.04-78.71% and 53.85-64.37% respectively. However, a zero-order reaction between loading rate and removal rate was obtained after loading rate of 170 g/m(2).day indicating the organic loading capacity of the system. Metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of bacteria with diverse metabolic potentials for substrate conversion. Removal of fecal coliforms was high in the CWs, but the most interesting observation was the attenuation in ARB, which was found to be comparable to, or even better, than the reported values from conventional moving bed bioreactor. This observation may be attributed to the high retention times offered by CWs compared to that of conventional systems making them an attractive future alternative for treating domestic as well as hospital sewage for emerging pollutants.

TI Modern, exogenous exposures associated with altered mammary gland
   development: A systematic review
SO EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
AB Background: Many women report low milk supply as the reason for premature breastfeeding cessation. Altered mammary gland development may impact a woman's lactation ability.
   Objective: This review identifies modern exogenous exposures which alter mammary gland development during embryonic life, puberty and pregnancy.
   Methods: A systematic review was undertaken whereby Medline, CINAHL and Embase articles published from January 1, 2005 to November 20, 2020 were searched using the keywords puberty or embry* or fetal or foetal or foetus or fetus or pregnan* or gestation* AND "mammary gland development" or "breast development" or "mammary development" or "mammary gland function" or "mammary function" or "insufficient glandular tissue" or "mammary hypoplasia" or "breast hypoplasia" or "mammary gland hypoplasia" or "tubular breast*" or "tuberous breast*" or "glandular tissue" or "breast composition" or "mammary composition" or &"mammary gland composition". After initial screening of 1207 records, 60 full texts were assessed for eligibility; 6 were excluded due to lack of information about exposure or outcome, leaving 54 studies.
   Results: The review included results from 52 animal (rats and mice, monkeys, rabbits, sheep, goats pigs and cows) and 2 human studies. Various endocrine disrupting chemicals and an obesogenic diet were found to be associated with altered mammary gland morphology during key development stages.
   Conclusions: To improve lactation outcomes, future studies need to focus on lactation as the endpoint and be conducted in a standardised manner to allow for a more significant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies.

TI Efficient photochemical vapor generation of bismuth using a coiled
   Teflon reactor: Effect of metal sensitizers and analytical performance
   with flame-in-gas-shield atomizer and atomic fluorescence spectrometry
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Photochemical vapor generation (PVG) of bismuth was accomplished in a simple flow?injection system with a standard Hg low-pressure tube lamp and a coiled Teflon reactor. The influence of a reaction medium flow rate (irradiation time) and composition was investigated using a miniature diffusion flame atomizer and highresolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry. Combination of 40% (v/v) acetic acid, 1.25% (v/v) formic acid and a metal sensitizer at a flow rate of 3 mL min? 1 (irradiation time of 90 s) was found optimal. The use of various metals as sensitizers was studied to initiate and enhance PVG substantially. The evident positive effect was found for four metal cations and the enhancement effect was in the following order: Cu2+ < Cd2+ < Fe2+ ? Co2+. At 50 mg L? 1 Co2+ as the sensitizer, the overall PVG efficiency of 54 ? 2% was determined from relative comparison of sensitivities obtained with PVG and liquid nebulization coupled simultaneously to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In order to reach low limits of detection (LOD) at low operation cost, a coupling of PVG to atomic fluorescence spectrometry was tested and conditions of atomization in two flame atomizers were optimized. A blank-limited LOD of 12 ng L? 1 was obtained with an advanced flame-in-gas-shield atomizer, which competes with PVG coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (5 ng L? 1). Interferences from commonly used inorganic acids (HNO3, HCl and H2SO4) and other elements (As3+, Pb2+, Sb3+, Se4+ and Te4+) were also investigated and the accuracy was verified by analysis of water Standard Reference Material NIST 1643f.

TI Male reproductive toxicity of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA): Rodent studies
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an artificial organic substance widely used for decades, which seriously threatens human health. This study aimed to identify human-relevant correlates between PFOA exposure and the male rodent reproductive system. We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOArelated reproductive toxicity was summarised as -0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, -0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Integrated analysis of physiological, transcriptomics and metabolomics
   provides insights into detoxication disruption of PFOA exposure in
   Mytilus edulis
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a persistent environmental contaminant, resists environmental degradation and bioaccumulates in food chains. Lots of literatures have proved that PFOA exposure could disrupt detoxifying function in a variety of organisms, however, it still remained poorly known about this in mollusk. Here, we examined physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic responses to PFOA in Mytilus edulis, a model organism frequently used in studies of aquatic pollution. We aimed to characterize PFOA-induced stress responses and detoxification mechanisms. PFOA exposure significantly altered antioxidant enzyme activity levels and the abundances of lipid peroxidation products. In addition, transcriptomic analysis indicated that several genes associated with oxidative stress and detoxication were differentially expressed after PFOA exposure. In combination, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that PFOA exposure disturbed several metabolic processes in M. edulis, including the lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism etc. Molecular examination and enzymes assay of PFOA-exposed M. edulis after a 7-day depuration period still did not recover to control levels. The Pathway enrichment analysis proved that several pathways related to detoxification, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) pathway etc, were obviously affected. The present work verifies firstly PFOA disruption to molluscan detoxification and identifies the key pathways to understand the molecular mechanisms thereof. This study provides new insights into the detoxication disruption invoked in response to PFOA exposure in M. edulis.

TI Climate change and industrial F-gases: A critical and systematic review
   of developments, sociotechnical systems and policy options for reducing
   synthetic greenhouse gas emissions
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Humanity has come to depend on synthetic, factory made gases that have extremely significant global warming potential. Fluorinated greenhouse gases, or F-gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) have been termed ?super pollutants? and ?super greenhouse gases? given their severe and powerful impact on the climate. They are the most potent greenhouse gases known to modern science, with global warming potentials far greater than carbon dioxide, some up to almost 24,000 times more so. Troublingly, they are also the fastest growing class of greenhouse gas emissions around the world, especially in developing countries. Research suggest that almost 40% of their emissions by 2050 will fall outside the scope of international agreements such as the Paris Accord, Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment. Without comprehensive and sustained interventions, uncontrolled growth in F-gas emissions could offset all of the gains made by the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, or the cornerstone of existing international climate governance, the Nationally Determined Contributions of the 2015 Paris Accord. This review asks: What options are available to mitigate the environmental impacts of F-gases and thus make their manufacturing or disposal far more sustainable? What technical solutions and innovations exist to make their industrial usage low to zero carbon? What benefits will accrue from F-gas mitigation, and what barriers will need addressed? It undertakes a comprehensive and critical review of more than 140,000 sources of evidence, and a short list of 855 studies on the topic. It utilizes a sociotechnical lens that examines the manufacturing and use of F-gases across multiple sectors (including refrigeration, electronics manufacturing, non-ferrous metals processing, and applications in consumer goods) and components of its lifecycle (including not only manufacturing, but also use, disposal and destruction). We find that there are several policies and regulations that can be employed to address this already serious and growing climate change challenge.

TI Caffeine removal from aqueous media by adsorption: An overview of
   adsorbents evolution and the kinetic, equilibrium and thermodynamic
   studies
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Caffeine is an emerging pollutant and is considered the most representative pollutant of the Pharmaceutical Active due to its high consumption by the general population. It can be used to track pollution caused by humans. Different technologies have been employed to remove the caffeine from aqueous media, however the adsorption has been preferred due to its simplicity, high removal efficiency, operational and implementation facility and low cost. This paper provides a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed literature concerned with caffeine removal by the adsorption process. The Scopus and SdenceDirect databases were used to identify relevant articles researches on caffeine removal. Many authors have studied caffeine's adsorption equilibrium in aqueous media, different conditions, and different adsorbents. This paper aims to uncover the overall trend of adsorbent used, kinetic and thermodynamic studies. The impact of pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage and competitive effect were presented and analyzed. It was observed that the adsorption capacities ranged between 10 and 1000 mg g(-1), according to the nature and properties of the adsorbent. The pseudo-second order (kinetic model) and the Langmuir isotherm model showed the best adjustment of the experimental data from caffeine adsorption in most studies. The mechanistic understanding of adsorption and the development of new adsorbents are still a matter of future research, as well as the use of other kinetic models based on statistical factors and the thermodynamic studies should be considered.

TI Thermal Regeneration of Spent Granular Activated Carbon Presents an
   Opportunity to Break the Forever PFAS Cycle
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Extensive use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has caused their ubiquitous presence in natural waters. One of the standard practices for PFAS removal from water is adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC); however, this approach generates a new waste stream, i.e., PFAS-laden GAC. Considering the recalcitrance of PFAS molecules in the environment, inadequate disposal (e.g., landfill or incineration) of PFAS-laden GAC may let PFAS back into the aquatic cycle. Therefore, developing approaches for PFAS-laden GAC management present unique opportunities to break its forever circulation within the aqueous environment. This comprehensive review evaluates the past two decades of research on conventional thermal regeneration of GAC and critically analyzes and summarizes the literature on regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs. Optimized thermal regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs may provide an opportunity to employ existing regeneration infrastructure to mineralize the adsorbed PFAS and recover the spent GAC. The specific objectives of this review are (i) to investigate the role of physicochemical properties of PFAS on thermal regeneration, (ii) to assess the changes in regeneration yield as well as GAC physical and chemical structure upon thermal regeneration, and (iii) to critically discuss regeneration parameters controlling the process. This literature review on the engineered regeneration process illustrates the significant promise of this approach that can break the endless environmental cycle of these forever chemicals, while preserving the desired physicochemical properties of the valuable GAC adsorbent.

TI Energy Evaluation of Electron Beam Treatment of Perfluoroalkyl
   Substances in Water: A Critical Review
SO ACS ES&T ENGINEERING
AB Due to their recalcitrant nature and ubiquitous use, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) will continue to be major water treatment hurdles. Although effective water treatment technologies exist for physical removal of many PFAS from water (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin), a PFAS-concentrated waste stream is generated as an end product that can potentially reintroduce PFAS back into the environment. Thus, there is an increased interest in developing destructive technologies to decompose and mineralize PFAS directly in water or in these waste streams. High energy electron beam (e-beam) accelerators have been used for water treatment to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant contaminants, including PFAS, since the 1960s. However, large-scale applications of e-beam for water treatment are restricted due to its high energy consumption and inability to treat large flow rates. Considering there are very few available technologies for destructive removal of PFAS, this study provides a critical review on the treatment of PFAS by direct irradiation of contaminated water by e-beam from an energy consumption point of view. To date, very limited studies have been conducted to investigate the success of this technology to treat PFAS. Results from the limited studies were not directly comparable due to the variation in operating conditions and water quality parameters used in the studies. Here, for the first time, we develop and apply the concept of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to assess the performance of e-beam for PFAS treatment. Results show that EE/O is a better performance parameter than the G value of e-beam for interstudy comparisons and to evaluate the effects of water quality and operating parameters on e-beam performance. We additionally developed a kinetic scheme to predict the performance of e-beam to treat PFAS and revealed that the competition between species to react with aqueous electrons is the determinant factor influencing PFAS degradation efficiency. Comparison of EE/O values of e-beam (range: 31-176 kWh m(-3) order(-1)) with other destructive technologies (range: 5-9595 kWh m(-3) order(-1)) suggest that e-beam, for PFAS treatment, is a promising approach under favorable conditions. This review further elucidates the feasibility and limitations of e-beam technology that could be improved upon to potentially make e-beam viable for large-scale water treatment applications.

TI Antibiotics in wastewater: From its occurrence to the biological removal
   by environmentally conscious technologies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB In this critical review, we explored the most recent advances about the fate of antibiotics on biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Although the occurrence of these pollutants in wastewater and natural streams has been investigated previously, some recent publications still expose the need to improve the detection strategies and the lack of information about their transformation products. The role of the antibiotic properties and the process operating conditions were also analyzed. The pieces of evidence in the literature associate several molecular properties to the antibiotic removal pathway, like hydrophobicity, chemical structure, and electrostatic interactions. Nonetheless, the influence of operating conditions is still unclear, and solid retention time stands out as a key factor. Additionally, the efficiencies and pathways of antibiotic removals on conventional (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic digestion, and nitrogen removal) and emerging bioprocesses (bioelectrochemical systems, fungi, and enzymes) were assessed, and our concern about potential research gaps was raised. The combination of different bioprocess can efficiently mitigate the impacts generated by these pollutants. Thus, to plan and design a process to remove and mineralize antibiotics from wastewater, all aspects must be addressed, the pollutant and process characteristics and how it is the best way to operate it to reduce the impact of antibiotics in the environment.

TI Chemical contaminants in Brazilian drinking water: a systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH
AB The goals of this research are to evaluate which chemical contaminations were detected in Brazil's drinking water reported in papers published from 2012 to 2019, to propose guideline values for emerging contaminants and assess which are the priority parameters from a health risk perspective. The methodology used was a systematic review. The chemical contaminants quantified were evaluated according to Brazilian's drinking-water standards, and Guideline Values were proposed for emerging pollutants using conservative endpoints from NOAEL and LOAEL available in literature. From 1351 articles evaluated, 15 reached the research goal. Seventy-seven parameters were quantified in Brazilian drinking water from underground, surface and rainwater sources. Soil composition, mining, sewage and agricultural activities were the main sources for the seven classes framed: pesticide, metal, organic, endocrine disruptor, drug, personal care product and illicit drug. Twenty-two parameters are listed in the current Brazilian drinking water quality standard and 54 are not. Water was not considered appropriate to drink due to cadmium, aluminum, iron, nickel, mercury, atrazine, propionaldehyde, beryllium, acetone and 17 a-ethinyl estradiol (carcinogenic). Measures to reduce chemical contamination in drinking water need to be taken such as the expansion of sewage treatment and upgrading to tertiary treatment, and controlling and reducing the application of pesticides.

TI Midterm results of modern patellofemoral arthroplasty versus total knee
   arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritis: systematic review
   and meta-analysis of comparative studies
SO ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY
AB Background Both Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) are accepted surgical options for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years' follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years' follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure.

TI Perfluorinated polymer modified vertical silicon nanowires as ultra low
   noise laser desorption ionization substrate for salivary metabolites
   profiling
SO TALANTA
AB Metabolites in the body fluid are becoming a rich source of disease biomarkers. Developing an effective and high throughput detection and analysis platform of metabolites is of great importance for potential biomarker discovery and validation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been successfully applied in rapid biomolecules detection in large scale. However, non-negligible background interference in low molecule-weight region still constitutes a main challenge even though various nanomaterials have been developed as an alternative to traditional organic matrix. In this work, a novel composite chip, silicon nanowires loaded with fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP@SiNWs) was fabricated. It can serve as an excellent substrate for nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) detection with ultra-low background noise in low molecular weight region (<500 Da). Ion desorption efficiency and internal energy transfer of FEP@SiNWs were studied using benzylpyridinium salt and tetraphenylboron salt as thermometer chemicals. The results indicated that a non-thermal desorption mechanism might be involved in the LDI process on FEP@SiNWs. Owing to the higher LDI efficiency and low background interference of this novel substrate, the metabolic fingerprint of complex bio-fluids, such as human saliva, can be sensitively and stably acquired. As a proof of concept, FEP@SiNWs chip was successfully used in the detection of salivary metabolites. With the assistance of multivariate analysis, 22 metabolic candidates (p < 0.05) which can discriminate type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM) and healthy volunteers were found and identified. The role of these feature metabolites in the metabolic pathway involved in 2-DM was confirmed by literature mining. This work demonstrates that FEP@SiNWs-based NIMS might be served as an efficient and high throughput platform for metabolic biomarker exploration and clinical diagnosis.

TI Catalytic Enantioselective Allylic C F Bond Functionalization
SO CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Catalytic enantioselective defluorinative functionalization of easily accessible allylic fluorines is well recognized as one of the most attractive strategies for creating allylic stereogenic centers with high enantioselectivity. This highlight review precisely aims to summarize the recent developments of this area mainly from the following six aspects: enantioselective defluoroarylation, enantioselective defluoroalkylation, enantioselective defluoroborylation, enantioselective defluorosilylation, enantioselective defluorohydrolation, and desymmetrization of difluoromethylene groups. Primarily, these reactions occur through two pathways, including beta-fluorine elimination and C-F oxidative addition. Despite this, the mechanisms and limitations of these strategies have been a focus, and it is hoped that this review will provide a comprehensive overview to evaluate the prospects of this rapidly emerging field.

TI Fragile-to-strong transitions in glass forming liquids
SO JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS
AB Since they were first reported almost two decades ago, fragile-to-strong (FTS) transitions have been observed in all categories of glass-forming systems including metallic, covalent, ionic and molecular liquids. In these systems, a transition from Arrhenius to non-Arrhenius viscosity behavior is observed in conjunction with anomalies in multiple thermodynamic variables including the heat capacity, the thermal expansion coefficient and the isothermal compressibility. A review of experimental evidences supporting the existence of FTS transitions is presented. In particular FTS transitions are found to be concomitant with a peak in heat-capacity as well as density extrema associated with a negative expansion coefficient in the region of the transition. Moreover, spectroscopic analyses also show distinct structural changes across these liquid-liquid transitions. Reports of FTS transitions in each category of liquid are reviewed.

TI Mixtures of persistent organic pollutants increase ovarian granulosa
   tumor cell line migration and spheroid invasion by upregulating MMP2
   expression and activity via IGF1R
SO TOXICOLOGY
AB Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) of the ovary have a good prognosis. Recurrence tends to be late; however, > 66 % of patients with recurrent GCT die from the disease. Most recurrences are abdominopelvic, although distant metastases have been documented. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a mixture of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) stimulates the invasion of GCT cells. We selected perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, 2 ng/mL), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS, 8 ng/mL), 2,2-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE, 1 ng/mL), polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB153, 100 pg/mL), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB, 50 pg/mL), which have the highest measured concentrations in follicular fluid of women undergoing treatment with assisted reproductive technology. The human GCT cell lines COV434 and KGN have been used as in vitro models of juvenile (JGCT) and adult (AGCT) GCT subtypes, respectively. Cells were treated with a mixture of the test compounds for 15 min prior to analysis of protein phosphorylation; for 4 h prior to analysis in a circular chemorepellent-induced defect assay; for 6 h prior to analysis of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity; for 24 h prior to analysis of migration, invasion, and gene expression; and for 48 h prior to analysis of protein expression. First, we showed that KGN cells migrated and exhibited invasive behavior. By contrast, COV434 cells lacked migration and invasion potential. Moreover, expression of mesenchymal genes and the gene encoding MMP2 was higher in KGN cells, and that of epithelial genes lower, than that in COV434 cells. Treatment of KGN cells with the EDC mixture stimulated cell migration, invasion, and lymphatic dissemination. The results suggest that the role of the EDC mixture in AGCT invasion is not related to changes in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes; rather, it is related to increased expression and activity of MMP2. Additionally, silencing insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1R) in AGCT abolished the stimulatory effect of the EDC mixture on KGN spheroid invasion. These results demonstrate that the EDC mixture increased KGN spheroid invasion by stimulating expression and activity of MMP2 via IGF1R.

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic.
   Objective
   To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk.
   Methods
   The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: "Endocrine disruptor(s)" OR "Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)" OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND "Breast cancer" to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables.
   Results
   We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements.
   Conclusion
   We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations.

TI Chemical Aspects of Human and Environmental Overload with Fluorine
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Over the last 100-120 years, due to the ever-increasing importance of fluorine-containing compounds in modern technology and daily life, the explosive development of the fluorochemical industry led to an enormous increase of emission of fluoride ions into the biosphere. This made it more and more important to understand the biological activities, metabolism, degradation, and possible environmental hazards of such substances. This comprehensive and critical review focuses on the effects of fluoride ions and organofluorine compounds (mainly pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals) on human health and the environment. To give a better overview, various connected topics are also discussed: reasons and trends of the advance of fluorine-containing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, metabolism of fluorinated drugs, withdrawn fluorinated drugs, natural sources of organic and inorganic fluorine compounds in the environment (including the biosphere), sources of fluoride intake, and finally biomarkers of fluoride exposure.

TI A review on contaminants of emerging concern in European raptors
   (2002-2020)
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Raptors (birds of prey and owls) have been widely used as suitable bioindicators of environmental pollution. They occupy the highest trophic positions in their food chains and are documented to bioaccumulate high concentrations of persistent pollutants such as toxic metals and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs).Whereas raptors played a critical role in developing awareness of and policy for chemical pollution, they have thus far played a much smaller role in current research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Given the critical knowledge obtained from monitoring 'legacy contaminants' in raptors, more information on the levels and effects of CECs on raptors is urgently needed. This study critically reviews studies on raptors fromEurope reporting the occurrence of CECs with focus on the investigated species, the sampled matrices, and the bioanalytical methods applied. Based on this, we aimed to identify future needs for monitoring CECs in Europe. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), novel flame retardants (NFRs), and to a lesser extent UV-filters, neonicotinoids, chlorinated paraffins, parabens and bisphenols have been reported in European raptors. White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) were the most frequently studied raptor species. Among matrices, eggs, feathers and plasmawere the most widely employed, although the potential role of the preen gland as an excretory organ for CECs has recently been proposed. This review highlights the following research priorities for pollution research on raptors in Europe: 1) studies covering all the main classes of CECs; 2) research in other European regions (mainly East Europe); 3) identification of the most suitable matrices and species for the analysis of different CECs; and 4) the application of alternative sample treatment strategies (e.g. QuEChERS or pressurized liquid extraction) is still limited and conventional solventextraction is the preferred choice.

TI In Situ X-ray Diffraction Investigation of the Crystallisation of
   Perfluorinated Ce-IV-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks with UiO-66 and
   MIL-140 Architectures**
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB We report on the results of an in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated Ce-IV-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated Zr-IV-based UiO-66 and MIL-140A, namely, F4_UiO-66(Ce) and F4_MIL-140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL-140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 degrees C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed-phased products are obtained. F4_UiO-66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO-66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate-determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL-140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO-66(Ce). Based on the in situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high-quality F4_MIL-140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 degrees C, 1 h) is also identified.

TI Enantioselective behavior of environmental chiral pollutants: A
   comprehensive review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Enantiomeric profiling of chiral environmental contaminants is an actual and imperative issue. Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities. Therefore the environmental fate of enantiomers always needs to be investigated.

TI Comparison of clinical outcomes with hip replacement versus PFNA in the
   treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly A systematic
   review and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
SO MEDICINE
AB Background: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of HR and PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. Methods: We carried out this review according to the principle of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies (RCSs), and case-control studies involving HR and PFNA in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly from 2000 to 2020 were compared by searching Web of Science, Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The quality of the included cohort study (CS) lines was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The quality of the included RCT lines was evaluated using Jadad. Forest plots were drawn by RevMan5.4 software based on the results and the data were analyzed. Results: After screening, a total of 9 articles were included, of which one was a clinical RCT and eight were RCSs with 1374 patients. The operative time of the PFNA group was shorter [WMD = 15.20; 95% CI (13.17, 17.23), P < .05] and the intraoperative blood loss was less [WMD = 178.81; 95% CI (97.24, 260.38), P < .05] than the HR group, while the first weight-bearing time of the HR group was shorter [WMD = -7.70; 95% CI (-10.54, -4.86), P < .05] than the PFNA group. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay, HHS, postoperative orthopedic complications, and postoperative medical complications between the 2 groups. Conclusion: With the development of HR technology and minimally invasive technology, the trauma caused by surgery is decreasing. Under the premise of improving perioperative management, such as optimizing the preoperative preparation and postoperative management, shortening the operative time, reducing intraoperative blood loss, and actively managing co-existing diseases, HR has more advantages than PFNA in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fractures.

TI Persistent organic pollutants and couple fecundability: a systematic
   review
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE
AB BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP).
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research.
   SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between I January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies.
   OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed.

TI PFAS and cancer, a scoping review of the epidemiologic evidence
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background: The number of studies addressing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cancer is increasing. Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure.
   Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge.
   Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an asso-ciation with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an as-sociation with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent.
   Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true asso-ciations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative.

TI Transition of aromatic volatile and transcriptome profiles during melon
   fruit ripening
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important diploid crop with a wide variety of flavors due to its distinct aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOC). To understand the development of VOC profiles during fruit development, we performed metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of two cantaloupe varieties over the course of fruit development. A total of 130 metabolites were detected in fruit samples, and 449014207 reads were mapped to the melon genome. A total of 4469 differentially expressed genes in fruits were identified and used to visualize the transition of VOC and transcriptomic profiles during the fruit development. A shift of VOC profiles in both varieties was observed from early-fruit profiles enriched in C5-C8 lipid-derived VOCs to late-fruit profiles abundant in C9 lipid-derived VOCs, apocarotenoids, and esters. The shift coincided with the expression of specific isoforms of lipid and carotenoid metabolizing enzymes as well as transcription factors involved in fruit ripening, metabolite regulation, and hormone signaling.

SO ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising hybrid thermal-membrane separation technology that can efficiently produce freshwater from seawater or contaminated wastewater. However, the relatively low flux and the presence of fouling or wetting agents in feed solution negate the applicability of MD for long term operation. In recent years, 'two-faced' membranes or Janus membranes have shown promising potential to decrease wetting and fouling problem of common MD system as well as enhance the flux performance. In this review, a comprehensive study was performed to investigate the various fabrication, modification, and novel design processes to prepare Janus membranes and discuss their performance in desalination and wastewater treatment utilizing MD. The promising potential, challenges and future prospects relating to the design and use of Janus membranes for MD are also tackled in this review. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Endocrine disrupting chemicals: Impacts on human fertility and fecundity
   during the peri-conception period
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than 1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans, dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity.

We describe the most common materials (silica, organic, and hybrid organic silica) and strategies for constructing monoliths in different moulds and shapes (tubes, cartridges, stir bars, fibers) published since 2015. The functionalization of the pore surfaces enhances their affinity towards different classes of pollutants. For instance, the incorporation of chelating groups enables the enrichment of potentially toxic metals and semi-metals in aquatic environments before the analyses by spectrometric techniques. Monolithic materials for extracting emerging pollutants, diverse classes of herbicides, and fungicides were proposed recently. Incorporation of carbon-based and magnetic nanoparticles, metal-organic frameworks, and ionic liquids enhanced their adsorption capacity by either increasing the surface area or providing multiple retention mechanisms. Monoliths with molecular recognition properties for highly selective extractions have been synthesized, including boronic functionalities and molecularly imprinted cavities. The final part describes the hybrid organic silica monoliths, emphasizing metal ions and speciation analysis hyphenated with ICP-MS. In the outlook section, we point to some fields we believe monoliths will benefit, such as their 3-D technologies preparation. We also pointed their potential applicability in portable chromatographic systems, restricted access materials, and enhanced use to preconcentrate viruses from aquatic environments.

TI Early-life perfluorooctanoic acid exposure induces obesity in male
   offspring and the intervention role of chlorogenic acid
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an emerging organic pollutant (EOP) hazardous to human health. Effects of maternal PFOA exposure on offspring as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, ICR mouse models of gestational low PFOA exposure (0.05 mg/kg/day) were established to investigate the roles on metabolic disorders of offspring. Body weight, body composition, hepatic lipid levels, transcriptome and metabolome were analyzed. Expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammasome formation and gut barrier integrity were measured. Furthermore, oral administration of chlorogenic acid (CGA) (100 mg/kg/day) was performed to observe the rescue effect on lipid disorders caused by PFOA exposure. Our findings demonstrated that gestational exposure to PFOA resulted in obesity, hepatic inflammation, disorders of lipid metabolism, and disruption of gut barrier integrity in male offspring. Notably, these adverse effects were attenuated by CGA supplementation. These data suggested that PFOA exposure during early life stage induced potential risks for later onset of obesity and metabolic disorder which could be ameliorated by CGA treatment.

TI Algae-induced photodegradation of antibiotics: A review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Antibiotics are a typical group of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) with emerging pollutant effects. The presence of residual antibiotics in the environment is a prominent issue owing to their potential hazards, toxic effects, and persistence. Several treatments have been carried out in aquatic environments in order to eliminate antibiotic residues. Among these, photodegradation is regarded as an environmentally-friendly and efficient option. Indirect photodegradation is the main pathway for the degradation of residual antibiotics in natural water, as opposed to direct photodegradation. Algae, working as photosensitizers, play an important role in the indirect photolysis of residual antibiotics in natural water bodies. They promote this reaction by secreting extracellular organic matters (EOMs) and inducing the generation of active species. In order to provide a thorough understanding of the effects of algae on residual antibiotic degradation in the environment, this paper comprehensively reviews the latest research regarding algae-induced antibiotic photodegradation. The summary of the different pathways and photosensitive mechanisms involved in this process show that EOMs are indispensable to antibiotic photodegradation. The influencing factors of algae-induced photodegradation are also discussed here: these include algae species, antibiotic types, and environmental variables such as light source, ferric ion presence, temperature, and ultrasound treatment. Based on the review of existing literature, this paper also considers several pathways for the future study of algae-induced antibiotic photodegradation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Structure-dependent absorption of atypical sphingoid long-chain bases
   from digestive tract into lymph
SO LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB Background Dietary sphingolipids have various biofunctions, including skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinoma properties. Long-chain bases (LCBs), the essential backbones of sphingolipids, are expected to be important for these bioactivities, and they vary structurally between species. Given these findings, however, the absorption dynamics of each LCB remain unclear. Methods In this study, five structurally different LCBs were prepared from glucosylceramides (GlcCers) with LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH and LCB 18:2(4E,8E);2OH moieties derived from konjac tuber (Amorphophallus konjac), from GlcCers with an LCB 18(9Me):2(4E,8E);2OH moiety derived from Tamogi mushroom (Pleurotus cornucopiae var. citrinopileatus), and from ceramide 2-aminoethyphosphonate with LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety and LCB 18(9Me):3(4E,8E,10E);2OH moiety derived from giant scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis), and their absorption percentages and metabolite levels were analyzed using a lymph-duct-cannulated rat model via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with a multistage fragmentation method. Results The five orally administered LCBs were absorbed and detected in chyle (lipid-containing lymph) as LCBs and several metabolites including ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingomyelins. The absorption percentages of LCBs were 0.10-1.17%, depending on their structure. The absorption percentage of LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH was the highest (1.17%), whereas that of LCB 18:3(4E,8E,10E);2OH was the lowest (0.10%). The amount of sphingomyelin with an LCB 18:2(4E,8Z);2OH moiety in chyle was particularly higher than sphingomyelins with other LCB moieties. Conclusions Structural differences among LCBs, particularly geometric isomerism at the C8-C9 position, significantly affected the absorption percentages and ratio of metabolites. This is the first report to elucidate that the absorption and metabolism of sphingolipids are dependent on their LCB structure. These results could be used to develop functional foods that are more readily absorbed.

TI The efficacy and safety of fast track surgery (FTS) in patients after
   hip fracture surgery: a meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB BackgroundFast track surgery (FTS) has been gradually applied in perioperative management of orthopedic surgery, but there still some research suspected that the prognosis of patients is not as expected and the cost is high, the effect of the FTS still urgently needed for support by evidence-based medicine.MethodsWe retrieved RCTs from medical research literature databases. Risk ratios (RR), standard mean difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the primary and safety endpoints.ResultsOverall, a total of 8886 patients were retrieved from 57 articles, of which 4448 patients (50.06%) were randomized to experimental group whereas 4438 patients (49.94%) were randomized to control group. The result showed that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay (LOS), decrease the visual analog scale (VAS), reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve Harris hip joint function score. The incidence of complications such as respiratory system infection, urinary system infection, venous thrombus embolism (VTE), pressure sore, incision infection, constipation, and prosthesis dislocation also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS improved patients' satisfaction apparently.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis reveals that FTS could significantly shorten the length of stay, alleviate the pain, reduce the leaving bed time and the hospitalization costs, and improve hip function. The incidence of complications also has been decreased significantly. Meanwhile, FTS has been spoken highly in patients in terms of nursing satisfaction. Its efficacy and safety were proved to be reliable.

TI A critical review of modeling Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)
   in the soil-water environment
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Due to their health effects and the recalcitrant nature of their C--F bonds, Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are widely investigated for their distribution, remediation, and toxicology in ecosystems. However, very few studies have focused on modeling PFAS in the soil-water environment. In this review, we summarized the recent development in PFAS modeling for various chemical, physical, and biological processes, including sorption, volatilization, degradation, bioaccumulation, and transport. PFAS sorption is kinetic in nature with sorption equilibrium commonly quantified by either a linear, the Freundlich, or the Langmuir isotherms. Volatilization of PFAS depends on carbon chain length and ionization status and has been simulated by a two-layer diffusion process across the air water interface. First-order kinetics is commonly used for physical, chemical, and biological degradation processes. Uptake by plants and other biota can be passive and/or active. As surfactants, PFAS have a tendency to be sorbed or concentrated on air-water or non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)water interfaces, where the same three isotherms for soil sorption are adopted. PFAS transport in the soil-water environment is simulated by solving the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) that is coupled to PFAS sorption, phase transfer, as well as physical, chemical, and biological transformations. As the physicochemical properties and concentration vary greatly among the potentially thousands of PFAS species in the environment, systematic efforts are needed to identify models and model parameters to simulate their fate, transport, and response to remediation techniques. Since many process formulations are empirical in nature, mechanistic approaches are needed to further the understanding of PFAS-soil-water-plant interactions so that the model parameters are less site dependent and more predictive in simulating PFAS remediation efficiency.

TI Organic solvent reverse osmosis membranes for organic liquid mixture
   separation: A review
SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
AB The separation of organic liquid mixtures by organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO) technology is promising owing to the high energy-efficiency. This article presents an overview of the endeavors made in the OSRO separation of organic liquid mixtures. First, the sub-nanometer separation characteristic of OSRO is introduced, and compared with pervaporation and organic solvent nanofiltration. Next, the mixtures of interest which may benefit from OSRO technology such as polar/nonpolar mixtures and their application scenarios are presented. The energy evaluation of OSRO, pervaporation, and distillation processes is also performed, highlighting the energy conservation feature of OSRO process. Subsequently, the OSRO membranes developed to date are comprehensively reviewed in term of their membrane materials, diving into organic (mainly cellulose types, polyethylene, polyamide, perfluompolymer), inorganic (carbon molecular sieves, silica, zeolite), and composite (polymers of intrinsic microporosity-1/AlOx) materials. The OSRO separation performances of the developed membranes are summarized and compared in term of flux and separation factor. Finally, we provide perspectives regarding the challenges and state the concluding remarks, in the hope that this review will inspire future studies to address efficient OSRO separations.

TI Integrated dual lag screws versus single lag screw cephalomedullary nail
   constructs: a meta-analysis and systematic review
SO HIP INTERNATIONAL
AB Background/Aim:
   This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of integrated dual lag screw (IDL) cephalomedullary nails (CMN) when compared with single lag screw (SL) constructs, in the internal fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures.
   Methods:
   The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed.
   Results:
   15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17-0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37-10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88-61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups.
   Conclusions:
   Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications. However, there is insufficient data to suggest that either nail construct is associated with better functional outcomes.

TI Network Analysis to Identify Communities Among Multiple Exposure
   Biomarkers Measured at Birth in Three Flemish General Population Samples
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Introduction: Humans are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals via different sources resulting in complex real-life exposure patterns. Insight into these patterns is important for applications such as linkage to health effects and (mixture) risk assessment. By providing internal exposure levels of (metabolites of) chemicals, biomonitoring studies can provide snapshots of exposure patterns and factors that drive them. Presentation of biomonitoring data in networks facilitates the detection of such exposure patterns and allows for the systematic comparison of observed exposure patterns between datasets and strata within datasets.
   Methods: We demonstrate the use of network techniques in human biomonitoring data from cord blood samples collected in three campaigns of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) (sampling years resp. 2002-2004, 2008-2009, and 2013-2014). Measured biomarkers were multiple organochlorine compounds, PFAS and metals. Comparative network analysis (CNA) was conducted to systematically compare networks between sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.
   Results: Network techniques offered an intuitive approach to visualize complex correlation structures within human biomonitoring data. The identification of groups of highly connected biomarkers, "communities," within these networks highlighted which biomarkers should be considered collectively in the analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies or in the design of toxicological mixture studies. Network analyses demonstrated in our example to which extent biomarker networks and its communities changed across the sampling campaigns, smoking status during pregnancy, and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.
   Conclusion: Network analysis is a data-driven and intuitive screening method when dealing with multiple exposure biomarkers, which can easily be upscaled to high dimensional HBM datasets, and can inform mixture risk assessment approaches.

TI Scoping Review-The Association between Asthma and Environmental
   Chemicals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups considered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma. Therefore, more research about exposure to environmental chemicals and risk of asthma is needed.

TI Low-cost adsorbents for environmental pollution control: a concise
   systematic review from the prospective of principles, mechanism and
   their applications
SO JOURNAL OF DISPERSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Nowadays, water scarcity is an identifiable problem facing society. However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%. Finally, the future development of further research and few suggestions are also prospected.

TI Meteorological patterns, technical validation, and chemical comparison
   of atmospheric dust depositions and bulk sand in the Arabian Gulf region
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB This study reports seasonal variations of meteorological parameters, atmospheric dust and dust-borne heavy metals concentrations measured, over a period of two years, next to two major airports (Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. On-line monitoring stations were installed at each location next to dust samplers used to frequently collect PM2.5 and PM10 on Teflon filters for metal analysis. Clear seasonal variation in meteorological parameters were identified. The particulate matter concentrations depicted from the two locations were continuously monitored. The PM2.5 concentration ranged from 50 to 100 mu g/m(3) on normal days but reached 350-400 mu g/m(3) per day during mild storms. The PM10 levels ranged between 100 and 250 mu g/m(3) during normal days and spiked to 750 mu g/m(3) during mild storms. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDS) revealed the presence of significant amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metals, which pose potential harm to aircraft engines. ICP analysis showed the presence of heavy and toxic metals in concentrations that may pose harm to human health. Bulk sand samples from Abu Dhabi sites showed chemical similarities to the atmospheric dust samples. The concentrations of heavy metals, PM2.5, and PM10 are at levels that require further monitoring due to their impact on human health. The two years meteorological monitoring, with the seasonal variations, provided additional regional data in the Arabian Gulf. Furthermore, the study concluded that Sand and Dust storms (SDS) occur more frequently at the northern Arabian Gulf compared to its southern region. The chemical correlation between atmospheric dust and regional desert sand suggests the localized origin of the smaller dust particles that may form by breaking apart of the ground sand grains. As a result of the ongoing urbanization in the region, it is essential to collect additional data from various locations for a longer period of time. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous research has mainly focused on different fermentation strategies, including the sequential feeding of xylose as the growth stage substrate and octanoic acid as the PHA-producing substrate, feeding glycerol as the sole carbon substrate, and co-feeding of lignin and glucose. This study developed a new strategy-co-feeding glycerol and lignin derivatives such as benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid in Pseudomonas putida KT2440-for the first time, which simultaneously improved both cell biomass and PHA production.ResultsCo-feeding lignin derivatives (i.e. benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid) and glycerol to P. putida KT2440 was shown for the first time to simultaneously increase cell dry weight (CDW) by 9.4-16.1% and PHA content by 29.0-63.2%, respectively, compared with feeding glycerol alone. GC-MS results revealed that the addition of lignin derivatives to glycerol decreased the distribution of long-chain monomers (C10 and C12) by 0.4-4.4% and increased the distribution of short-chain monomers (C6 and C8) by 0.8-3.5%. The H-1-C-13 HMBC, H-1-C-13 HSQC, and H-1-H-1 COSY NMR analysis confirmed that the PHA monomers (C6-C14) were produced when glycerol was fed to the bacteria alone or together with lignin derivatives. Moreover, investigation of the glycerol/benzoate/nitrogen ratios showed that benzoate acted as an independent factor in PHA synthesis. Furthermore, H-1, C-13 and P-31 NMR metabolite analysis and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics measurements suggested that the addition of benzoate stimulated oxidative-stress responses, enhanced glycerol consumption, and altered the intracellular NAD(+)/NADH and NADPH/NADP(+) ratios by up-regulating the proteins involved in energy generation and storage processes, including the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the reductive TCA route, trehalose degradation, fatty acid beta -oxidation, and PHA biosynthesis.ConclusionsThis work demonstrated an effective co-carbon feeding strategy to improve PHA content/yield and convert lignin derivatives into value-added products in P. putida KT2440. Co-feeding lignin break-down products with other carbon sources, such as glycerol, has been demonstrated as an efficient way to utilize biomass to increase PHA production in P. putida KT2440. Moreover, the involvement of aromatic degradation favours further lignin utilization, and the combination of proteomics and metabolomics with NMR sheds light on the metabolic and regulatory mechanisms for cellular redox balance and potential genetic targets for a higher biomass carbon conversion efficiency.

TI Environmental exposures and the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease:
   The potential role of BACE1 as a critical neurotoxic target
SO JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR TOXICOLOGY
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health crisis due to devastating cognitive symptoms, a lack of curative treatments, and increasing prevalence. Most cases are sporadic (>95% of cases) after the age of 65 years, implicating an important role of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis. Environmental neurotoxicants have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease and AD. Animal models of AD and in vitro studies have shed light on potential neuropathological mechanisms, yet the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of AD-relevant environmental neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a potentially critical pathogenic target of environmentally induced neurotoxicity. BACE1 clearly has a critical role in AD pathophysiology: It is required for amyloid beta production and expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the AD brain. Though the literature on BACE1 in response to environmental insults is limited, current studies, along with extensive AD neurobiology literature suggest that BACE1 deserves attention as an important neurotoxic target. Here, we critically review research on environmental neurotoxicants such as metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polyfluoroalkyl substances, heterocyclic aromatic amines, advanced glycation end products, and acrolein that modulate BACE1 and potential mechanisms of action. Though more research is needed to clearly understand whether BACE1 is a critical mediator of AD-relevant neurotoxicity, available reports provide convincing evidence that BACE1 is altered by environmental risk factors associated with AD pathology, implying that BACE1 inhibition and its use as a biomarker should be considered in AD management and research.

TI Progress on the photo aging mechanism of microplastics and related
   impact factors in water environment
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB As an emerging pollutant, microplastics (MPs. plastic particles with size < 5 mm) pollution in water has acquired extensive attention in recent years due to their small particle size and stable properties, which can act as a carrier for pollutants in water environment and have toxic hazards to aquatic organisms. After entering into water environment, MPs are readily undergone varied types of weathering processes (i.e.. hydrolysis, photo oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation), leading to shifted surface morphology (i.e., surface roughness, specific surface area, and size) and physicochemical properties (i.e.. melting temperature, surface charge, molecular weight, crystallinity, and hydrophobicity). Among different weathering processes of MI's in water, sunlight induced photo aging process has been considered as primary contributor, which will further impact the MPs behaviors, such as aggregation and deposition in water column, adsorption to organic and inorganic pollutants, leaching of additives. as well as toxicity to organisms in water. From the perspective of MPs aging mechanism. photo aging process of MPs in water environment is a free radical associated chain reaction process and readily to be affected by polymer types, plastic additives. halogen ions, and natural organic matters. These components are generally photochemical activated and prone to involved in the direct or free radical associated indirect photo aging process processed. However. limited information has referred the impact of plastic additives and water constitutes on the long term weathering process for MI's in water, which will pose a great difference between laboratory-accelerated weathering and long-term natural weathering. Studying the photo aging mechanism of MI's in water environment is of great significance for evaluating their formation process and potential ecological risks. Based on the above considerations. we systematically reviewed the photo aging and fragmentation processes of MPs in water environment. The content of this work contains: (1) Photo aging mechanism and changes of MI's physicochemical properties during aging process in water. Research results revealed that photo aging process could affect the molecular arrangement and mechanical properties of MPs, and further fragment into smaller size secondary MPs even in nano-scale particles, which is important to explain the formation of MI's in current water environment. (2) Critical effect of plastic properties. such as polymer type. size. and plastic additives on the aging of MI's in water, for the impact of plastic additives on the aging process of MI's. results in this work suggested that photo aging mechanism of MI's could be modified due to the presence of plastic additive (i.e., antioxidant and colorant). (3) Role of water constitutes (i.e., Cl-, Br, and NOM) on the photo aging process of MI's in water. The results emphasized the multiple impacts of water constitutes (halogen ions and natural organic matter) in the photo aging process of MPs in the water environment, illustrating that MI's may have different aging time and mechanisms in different water matrices.
   Moreover, impact of microorganism induced biodegradation for MPs in water is also proposed. In further study, more concentration should be concerned on the combined effects of plastic additives and water quality conditions on the aging process of MPs, which is helpful to shorten the distance between laboratory accelerated weathering and long-term aging process of MI's in natural waters. Besides, results of this paper can also provide theoretical support for comprehensively and systematically assessing the environmental behavior, toxicological effects and ecological risks of aged MPs in natural water environment.

TI On the Calculation of Optical Characteristics and Dimensional Shifts of
   Surface Plasmons of Spherical Bimetallic Nanoparticles
SO PHYSICS OF THE SOLID STATE
AB Formulas of efficient relaxation time are obtained for the cases when the free length of electrons is less or comparable with the characteristic dimensions of metallic regions. The frequency dispersion of optical characteristics of spherical bimetallic particles is calculated near plasma resonance in the absence of quantum-size effects. Retaining the style of common description of metallic particles based on the Mie-Drude theories, the frequency dependence of electric dipole polarizability of a two-layered metallic nanosphere was analyzed. The appearance of two polarizability maxima is the result of a difference in core and shell metals. The calculations are conducted for the following particles immersed into teflon: Au@Ag, Ag@Au, Au@Pt, Pt@Au, and Pt@Pd. It is demonstrated that the optical characteristics of bimetallic particles can be controlled by means of changing their composition and volumetric metal content. Cross-sections of absorption and scattering, as well as optical radiation efficiency of the particles in a wide spectrum range are calculated. Possible temperature of bimetallic particles at the absorption of an electromagnetic wave (for the photothermal therapy of malignant tumors) is estimated.

TI Environmental Substances Associated with Osteoporosis-A Scoping Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Introduction: Osteoporosis is a disease having adverse effects on bone health and causing fragility fractures. Osteoporosis affects approximately 200 million people worldwide, and nearly 9 million fractures occur annually. Evidence exists that, in addition to traditional risk factors, certain environmental substances may increase the risk of osteoporosis. Methods: The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a joint program coordinating and advancing human biomonitoring in Europe. HBM4EU investigates citizens' exposure to several environmental substances and their plausible health effects aiming to contribute to policymaking. In HBM4EU, 18 priority substances or substance groups were selected. For each, a scoping document was prepared summarizing existing knowledge and health effects. This scoping review is based on these chemical-specific scoping documents and complementary literature review. Results: A possible link between osteoporosis and the body burden of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and industrial chemicals such as phthalates and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) was identified. Conclusions: Evidence shows that environmental substances may be related to osteoporosis as an adverse health effect. Nevertheless, more epidemiological research on the relationship between health effects and exposure to these chemicals is needed. Study results are incoherent, and pervasive epidemiological studies regarding the chemical exposure are lacking.

TI From Environmental to Possible Occupational Exposure to Risk Factors:
   What Role Do They Play in the Etiology of Endometriosis?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder characterized by the presence of endometrial stroma and glands outside the uterine cavity. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the "PRISMA" statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role. In order to clarify the potential occupational risk of endometriosis development, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the potential association between chemical compounds and disease etiology.

TI A systematic review and ecological risk assessment for organic
   ultraviolet filters in aquatic environments
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB care (e.g. sunscreens) and plastic items. This review summarizes the available data regarding the toxic effects of OUVFs on marine and freshwater organisms and generates the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values necessary for assessing ecological risk. Through a systematic search of the literature, 89 studies were identified and ecotoxicological data extracted. Collectively, these studies described toxicity testing with 39 OUVF from 10 structural classes, with derivatives of benzophenones (49%) and camphors (16%) most studied. There was a bias towards selecting freshwater species (61%), and evaluating single OUVF effects (87%) rather than OUVF mixtures. Short-term (acute) experimentation (58%) was marginally more common than long-term (chronic) testing (42%). Reproductive, developmental, genetic, and neurological toxicity were the most commonly identified effects in aquatic organism, and were associated with molecular interactions with steroid receptors, DNA, or the production of reactive oxygen species. Species sensitivity distribution and/or assessment factors were used to calculate PNECs for 22 OUVFs and the risk quotients for 12 OUVFs. When using maximum concentrations, high risk was observed for six OUVFs in marine environments (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, octocrylene, padimate-O, benzophenone-1, and oxybenzone, ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate), and for four OUVFs in freshwater environments (ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, avobenzone and oxybenzone). When using median concentrations, a risk to marine environments was observed for oxybenzone. The results of this review underline that there is limited knowledge of the pathological effects of OUVFs and their metabolites in aquatic environments, and this inhibits the development of informed water-quality guidelines.

TI Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
   from indoor media: A systematic review protocol
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Human exposure to perand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. However, additional PFAS exposure pathways have been raised by a limited number of studies reporting correlations between commercial and industrial products and PFAS levels in human media and biomonitoring. Systematic review (SR) methodologies have been widely used to evaluate similar questions using an unbiased approach in the fields of clinical medicine, epidemiology, and toxicology, but the deployment in exposure science is ongoing. Here we present a systematic review protocol that adapts existing systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools to exposure science studies in order to investigate evidence for important PFAS exposure pathways from indoor media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and dust.
   Objectives: We will systematically review exposure science studies that present both PFAS concentrations from indoor exposure media and PFAS concentrations in blood serum or plasma. Exposure estimates will be synthesized from the evidence to answer the question, "For the general population, what effect does exposure from PFAS chemicals via indoor media have on blood, serum or plasma concentrations of PFAS?" We adapt existing systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools from the U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments and the Navigation Guide for exposure science studies, as well as present innovative developments of exposure pathway-specific search strings for use in artificial intelligence screening software.
   Data Sources: We will search electronic databases for potentially relevant literature, including Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest. Literature search results will be stored in EPA's Health and Environmental Research Online (HERO) database. Study eligibility and criteria: Included studies will present exposure measures from indoor media including con sumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and dust, paired with PFAS concentrations in blood, serum or plasma from adults and/or children in the general population. We focus on a subset of PFAS chemicals including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA).
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies will be prefiltered at the title and abstract level using computationally intelligent search strings to expedite the screening process for reviewers. Two independent reviewers will screen the prefiltered studies against inclusion criteria at the title/abstract level and then full-text level, after which the reviewers will assess the studies' risk of bias using an approach modified from established systematic review tools for exposure studies. Exposure estimates will be calculated to investigate the proportion of blood, serum or plasma) PFAS concentrations that can be explained by exposure to PFAS in indoor media.

TI "Drop-in" fuel production from biomass: Critical review on
   techno-economic feasibility and sustainability
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB This paper reviews the technological and economical feasibilities as well as sustainable assessment of approaches (thermochemical and biochemical) applied for sustainable "drop-in" fuel production from lignocellulosic sources. The challenges for each pathway to produce "drop-in" fuels are covered. Currently "drop-in" fuel production cost is approximately 2 times (similar to 5-6$/gallon) higher than fossil fuels (3$/gallon), especially with the use of 2nd generation feedstocks. The primary sources of cost with "drop-in" fuel production are feedstock cost (40-60% of the total production cost), syngas cleaning and conditioning to meet Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requirement (12-15% of the total production cost) and bio oil upgrading (14-18% of the total production cost) in the case of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The most influential factors on the life cycle analysis (LCA) were biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass pre-treatment, and transportation. Therefore, robust processes that can use local waste biomass are far more environmental and economically viable, especially as biofuel from second generation have a greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (50-100%) than first generation biofuels (50-90%) when land use changes are omitted in the LCA. The sustainability of biofuels is pre-dominantly dependant on the sustainability of the initial biomass, with 2nd generation feedstocks being more sustainable than 1st generation. Gasification-FTS is considered as the most promising technique for "drop-in" fuel production over pyrolysis and HTL due to its flexibility towards feedstock acceptance and the ability to produced high yields of liquid fuel together with other economically viable biofuels such as electricity and heat. Biochemical routes (i. e.fermentation) to "drop-in" fuels are still in their early development stages, and therefore require more studies and pilot-scale experiments in order to discover an economic and sustainable means of using these methods.

TI Biometric assessments of the posterior fossa by fetal MRI: A systematic
   review
SO PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS
AB Background Posterior fossa abnormalities (PFAs) are commonly identified within routine screening and are a frequent indication for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although biometric measurements of the posterior fossa (PF) are established on fetal ultrasound and MRI, qualitative visual assessments are predominantly used to differentiate PFAs.
   Objectives This systematic review aimed to assess 2-dimensional (2D) biometric measurements currently in use for assessing the PF on fetal MRI to delineate different PFAs.
   Methods The protocol was registered (PROSPERO ID CRD42019142162). Eligible studies included T2-weighted MRI PF measurements in fetuses with and without PFAs, including measurements of the PF, or other brain areas relevant to PFAs.
   Results 59 studies were included - 6859 fetuses had 62 2D PF and related measurements. These included linear, area and angular measurements, representing measures of PF size, cerebellum/vermis, brainstem, and supratentorial measurements. 11 measurements were used in 10 or more studies and at least 1200 fetuses. These dimensions were used to characterise normal for gestational age, diagnose a range of pathologies, and predict outcome.
   Conclusion A selection of validated 2D biometric measurements of the PF on fetal MRI may be useful for identification of PFA in different clinical settings. Consistent use of these measures, both clinically and for research, is recommended.

TI Environmental chemicals, breast cancer progression and drug resistance
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms.

TI Lithium-ion batteries - Current state of the art and anticipated
   developments
SO JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB Lithium-ion batteries are the state-of-the-art electrochemical energy storage technology for mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles. Accordingly, they have attracted a continuously increasing interest in academia and industry, which has led to a steady improvement in energy and power density, while the costs have decreased at even faster pace. Important questions, though, are, to which extent and how (fast) the performance can be further improved, and how the envisioned goal of truly sustainable energy storage can be realized.
   Herein, we combine a comprehensive review of important findings and developments in this field that have enabled their tremendous success with an overview of very recent trends concerning the active materials for the negative and positive electrode as well as the electrolyte. Moreover, we critically discuss current and anticipated electrode fabrication processes, as well as an essential prerequisite for "greener" batteries - the recycling. In each of these chapters, we eventually summarize important remaining challenges and propose potential directions for further improvement. Finally, we conclude this article with a brief summary of the performance metrics of commercial lithium-ion cells and a few thoughts towards the future development of this technology including several key performance indicators for the mid-term to long-term future.

TI Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in soil and sediments: Occurrence,
   fate, remediation and future outlook
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS5) are contaminants of great concern due to their widespread occurrence and persistence in the environments (i.e., in water, soil and sediment) and potential toxicology even at very low concentration. The main focus of this review is on the PFASs in soil and sediments. More specifically, this review systematically examines the occurrence and toxicological effects with associated risks, fate (i.e., PFASs adsorption by soil and sediment, transportation and transformation, and bioaccumulation), and remediation practices of PFASs in soil and sediment. Various models and equations such as fugacity-based multimedia fate and hydrodynamic models are used to study the fate, transport, and transformation of PFASs. Among different remediation practices, sorption is the dominant process for the removal of PFASs from soil and sediments. Results also indicate that PFASs adsorption onto activated carbon decrease with the increase of carbon chain length in the PFASs. The longer-chain PFASs have larger partition coefficient values than shorter-chained PFASs. Sorption of PFASs to soil and sediments are mainly governed by different electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds formation, hydrophobic interactions, organic content in soil and sediments, and ligand exchange. Other technology such as thermal treatment might be potential in the removal of PAFSs, but need further study to elucidate a conclusion. Finally, the associated challenges and future outlook have been included. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of clinical and radiological outcomes in intertrochanteric
   fractures treated with InterTAN nail against conventional
   cephalomedullary nails: a systematic review
SO FUTURE SCIENCE OA
AB Intertrochanteric fractures, accountable for 50% of hip fractures, can be fixed with cephalomedullary devices such as Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA (TM)), Gamma3 nailing system and TRIGEN (TM) InterTAN (TM) nail (IT). IT uniquely uses two cephalocervical screws that allow for linear compression and provide additional resistance to femoral head rotation. A literature review assessing clinical outcomes of these devices was conducted, with 14 studies enrolling 3104 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. PFNA and Gamma3 had better intraoperative outcomes compared with IT; however, IT had superior implant-related outcomes of cut-out and screw migration. No difference was found between IT and PFNA or Gamma3 in Harris Hip Scores, time to union, malunion and nonunion. Further long-term studies are needed to evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of cephalomedullary devices.
   Lay abstract
   Hip fractures remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality within healthcare systems, with an estimated global incidence of 1.6 million fractures annually. Certain intertrochanteric fractures - a specific subtype of hip fractures - are treated surgically using intramedullary nailing devices such as Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA (TM)), Gamma3 nailing system and InterTAN (TM) nail (IT). IT is unique, in that it uses two proximal screws. This study assessed the clinical and radiological outcomes of using IT over the traditional one-screw devices PFNA and Gamma3.

TI Does patellofemoral osteoarthritis affect functional outcomes and
   survivorship after medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty? A
   meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB Purpose The argument that patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is a contraindication to unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) remains to be resolved. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to determine whether PFOA affects functional outcomes and survivorship after medial UKA. Methods A literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and Web of science to identify studies published in English (the last search was updated on June 1, 2020). The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), whereas the secondary outcomes included range of motion (ROM) and the revision rate. Patients with patellofemoral joint narrowing or cartilage lesions as assessed intraoperatively or by radiography were assigned to the PFOA group. Results A total of 8 studies involving 3504 patients and 3975 knees were included in this meta-analysis. No patients had a severe lateral patellar groove. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the OKS, revision rate and ROM between PFOA patients and patients without PFOA. Conclusions No significant difference in functional outcomes and survivorship was found between patients with and without PFOA. Patients with PFOA assessed by radiographs or intraoperatively but without a lateral patellar groove should be considered candidates for medial UKA.

TI Uptake/release of organic contaminants by microplastics: A critical
   review of influencing factors, mechanistic modeling, and thermodynamic
   prediction methods
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The role of microplastics (MPs) as a vector of chemicals is generally recognized: a wide range of micropollutants have been detected in MPs sampled in different environmental compartments, and, due to their ubiquitous distribution, they can be transferred through aquatic and terrestrial organisms into the food chain. Providing representative models is challenging due to the intrinsic dynamic evolution characterizing the natural phenomena, which cannot be adequately investigated in lab experiments. On the other side, simulation/prediction tools are strongly required because of the long time-scale characterizing the MPs' persistence in the environment. This article provides a review of the updated literature on mechanistic models and predictive thermodynamic methods applied (or applicable), to describe the uptake/release processes of pollutants by MPs. Intrinsic and environmental factors influencing the process kinetics and the equilibrium distribution are discussed in detail. Mechanistic models and thermodynamic prediction methods are analyzed and their potentialities for application to MPs highlighted with specific examples. Finally, a critical analysis of the limitations related to the simplifying assumptions in modeling and to the representativeness of the lab-scale data is performed to evaluate their effects on the reliability of the predictions and to identify knowledge gaps and address future research needs.

TI A critical review of antibiotic removal strategies: Performance and
   mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Environmental pollution by antibiotics has severely affected human health and development. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have also been recognized as emerging pollutants because of their persistence and adverse impacts in aquatic ecosystems, even at low concentrations. For the alleviation and elimination of antibiotics stress, several approaches have been proposed, some of which have been applied in practice. This review systematically summarizes the removal strategies for various antibiotics and their corresponding mechanisms, including chemical, physical, biological, condition-based and combined strategies. Moreover, a comparison among these methods is made with a focus on the performance and efficiency. Further research needs are also proposed, which provides a guidance for the establishment of a control strategy to achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen, antibiotics and ARGs.

TI Work Conditions and Practices in Norwegian Fire Departments From 1950
   Until Today: A Survey on Factors Potentially In fl uencing Carcinogen
   Exposure
SO SAFETY AND HEALTH AT WORK
AB Background: Meta-analyses have shown firefighters to be at an increased risk of several cancer types. Occupational carcinogen exposure may explain these increased risks. This study aims to describe Norwegian fire departments' work conditions from 1950 until today, focusing on factors relevant for potential occupational carcinogen exposure.
   Methods: With the help of a reference group, we developed a questionnaire on topics related to occupational exposure to carcinogens for the period 1950-2018. Selected Norwegian fire departments provided department-specific responses.
   Results: Sixteen departments, providing fire services for 48% of the Norwegian population as of 2019 and mainly consisting of professional firefighters, responded to our questionnaire. The introduction of synthetic firefighting foams, more regular live fire training, the introduction of chemical diving, and a higher number of diesel-driven fire service vehicles were identified as changes thought to increase exposure to occupational carcinogens. Changes thought to decrease exposure included the switch from negative to positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatuses, the use of self-contained breathing apparatuses during all phases of firefighting, the use of ventilating fans during firefighting, increased attention to flammable materials used during live fire training, increased attention to handling and cleaning of turnout gear and other equipment, and installment of exhaust removal systems in apparatus bays.
   Conclusion: Norwegian fire departments' work conditions have seen several changes since 1950, and this could influence firefighters' occupational carcinogen exposure. A peak of carcinogen exposure may have occurred in the 1970s and 1980s before recent changes have reduced exposure.

TI Impurities in biogas: Analytical strategies, occurrence, effects and
   removal technologies
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB The growing concerns on the sustainability of our planet have been leading the way to the development of alternative and renewable forms of energy. One example is the use of waste (e.g. sewage sludge, forest residues, agroindustry and food processing) to produce biogas. Comprised mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, it can be used as fuel in cogeneration systems, automotive mobility and domestic heating, among other applications. The increasing interest in the use of biogas has raised some questions regarding its quality for energy valorization. To start, the carbon dioxide content must be adjusted to upgrade the calorific power and economic value and then common potentially hazardous and even toxic impurities such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfur, halogens, or ammonia should be removed to ensure a correct operation. Recently, a close attention was drawn to the presence of siloxanes. These widespread emerging pollutants compromise the use of biogas for energy production due to the formation of abrasive silicon oxides after combustion that deposit on and damage several engine parts. In addition, some of them are potentially toxic and persistent, involving a threat to humans and the environment, which increased drastically the literature devoted to them in the last years. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the literature available on biogas impurities, presenting their main effects, sampling and analytical strategies, and concentrations. A summary of removal methodologies is also presented to address the technological challenges to cope with these unwanted compounds.

TI Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and allergic outcomes in children:
   A systematic review and meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and widespread throughout the environment. Although exposure to PFASs may contribute to the development of allergic diseases in children, evidence about this association remains inconclusive.
   Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between PFASs exposure and allergic diseases in children based on current evidence.
   Methods: The databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to identify all observational studies that examined the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of childhood allergic diseases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of case-crossover studies, and a previously validated quality assessment framework was used for observational studies lacking control groups. Randomeffects meta-analysis models were applied to pool odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: From an initial 94 articles (after duplicate removal), 13 studies through full-text assessment were included for quantitative assessment and descriptive synthesis. They are ten cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. The pooled estimates showed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was associated with eczema (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.80-0.99), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01-1.58), and perfluomoctanoic acid (PFOA) with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13-1.56). However, no such significant associations were found for wheeze and asthma.
   Conclusions: The meta-analysis results suggest that PFASs exposure could potentially be associated with eczema, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis during childhood, but not with childhood asthma or wheeze. Future studies are needed to verify these findings.

TI Dysregulated lipid and fatty acid metabolism link perfluoroalkyl
   substances exposure and impaired glucose metabolism in young adults
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure is ubiquitous among the US population and has been linked to adverse health outcomes including cardiometabolic diseases, immune dysregulation and endocrine disruption. However, the metabolic mechanism underlying the adverse health effect of PFASs exposure is unknown.
   Objective: The aim of this project is to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and altered metabolic pathways linked to increased cardiometabolic risk in young adults.
   Methods: A total of 102 young adults with 82% overweight or obese participants were enrolled from Southern California between 2014 and 2017. Cardiometabolic outcomes were assessed including oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures, body fat and lipid profiles. High-resolution metabolomics was used to quantify plasma exposure levels of three PFAS congeners and intensity profiles of the untargeted metabolome. Fasting concentrations of 45 targeted metabolites involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism were used to verify untargeted metabolomics findings. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was used to examine the associations between PFAS exposure mixture and cardiometabolic outcomes adjusting for covariates. Mummichog pathway enrichment analysis was used to explore PFAS-associated metabolic pathways. Moreover, the effect of PFAS exposure on the metabolic network, including metabolomic profiles and cardiometabolic outcomes, was investigated.
   Results: Higher exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was associated with higher 30-minute glucose levels and glucose area under the curve (AUC) during the OGTT (p < 0.001). PFAS exposure was also associated with altered lipid pathways, which contributed to the metabolic network connecting PFOA and higher glucose levels following the OGTT. Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that higher PFOA exposure was associated with higher levels of glycerol (p = 0.006), which itself was associated with higher 30-minute glucose (p = 0.006).
   Conclusions: Increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation could contribute to the biological mechanisms linking PFAS exposure and impaired glucose metabolism among young adults. Findings of this study warrants future experimental studies and epidemiological studies with larger sample size to replicate.

TI Review: Evolution of evidence on PFOA and health following the
   assessments of the C8 Science Panel
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: The C8 Science Panel was composed of three epidemiologists charged with studying the possible health effects of PFOA in a highly exposed population in the mid-Ohio Valley. The Panel determined in 2012 there was a 'probable link' (i.e., more probable than not based on the weight of the available scientific evidence) between PFOA and high cholesterol, thyroid disease, kidney and testicular cancer, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and ulcerative colitis.
   Objective: Here, former C8 Science Panel members and collaborators comment on the PFOA literature regarding thyroid disorders, cancer, immune and auto-immune disorders, liver disease, hypercholesterolemia, reproductive outcomes, neurotoxicity, and kidney disease. We also discuss developments regarding fate and transport, and pharmacokinetic models, and discuss causality assessment in cross-sectional associations among low-exposed populations.
   Discussion: For cancer, the epidemiologic evidence remains supportive but not definitive for kidney and testicular cancers. There is consistent evidence of a positive association between PFOA and cholesterol, but no evidence of an association with heart disease. There is evidence for an association with ulcerative colitis, but not for other auto-immune diseases. There is good evidence that PFOA is associated with immune response, but uneven evidence for an association with infectious disease. The evidence for an association between PFOA and thyroid and kidney disease is suggestive but uneven. There is evidence of an association with liver enzymes, but not with liver disease. There is little evidence of an association with neurotoxicity. Suggested reductions in birthweight may be due to reverse causality and/or confounding. Fate and transport models and pharmacokinetic models remain central to estimating past exposure for new cohorts, but are difficult to develop without good historical data on emissions of PFOA into the environment.
   Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiologic evidence remains limited. For a few outcomes there has been some replication of our earlier findings. More longitudinal research is needed in large populations with large exposure contrasts. Additional cross-sectional studies of low exposed populations may be less informative.

TI A Critical Review of a Recommended Analytical and Classification
   Approach for Organic Fluorinated Compounds with an Emphasis on Per- and
   Polyfluoroalkyl Substances
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
AB Organic fluorinated compounds have been detected in various environmental media and biota. Some of these compounds are regulated locally (e.g., perfluorononanoic acid maximum contaminant level in drinking water by the New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection), nationally (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid maximum acceptable concentration in drinking water by Health Canada), or internationally (e.g., Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants). Globally, regulators and researchers seek to identify the organic fluorinated compounds associated with potential adverse effects, bioaccumulation, mobility, and persistence to manage their risks, and, to understand the beneficial attributes they bring to products such as first responder gear, etc. Clarity is needed to determine the best analytical method for the goal of the analyses (e.g., pure research or analysis to determine the extent of an accidental release, monitoring groundwater for specific compounds to determine regulatory compliance, and establish baseline levels in a river of organic fluorinated substances associated with human health risk prior to a clean-up effort). Analytical techniques that identify organic fluorine coupled together with targeted chemical analysis will yield information sufficient to identify public health or environmental hazards.

TI Uptake and accumulation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in plants
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a class of persistent organic contaminants that are ubiquitous in the environment and have been found to be accumulated in agricultural products. Consumption of PFAS-contaminated agricultural products represents a feasible pathway for the trophic transfer of these toxic chemicals along food chains/webs, leading to risks associated with human and animal health. Recently, studies on plant uptake and accumulation of PFASs have rapidly increased; consequently, a review to summarize the current knowledge and highlight future research is needed. Analysis of the publications indicates that a large variety of plant species can take up PFASs from the environment. Vegetables and grains are the most commonly investigated crops, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as the most studied PFASs. The potential sources of PFASs for plant uptake include industrial emissions, irrigation with contaminated water, land application of biosolids, leachates from landfill sites, and pesticide application. Root uptake is the predominant pathway for the accumulation of PFASs in agricultural crops, and uptake by plant aboveground portions from the ambient atmosphere could play a minor role in the overall PFAS accumulation. PFAS uptake by plants is influenced by physicochemical properties of compounds (e.g., perfluorocarbon chain length, head group functionality, water solubility, and volatility), plant physiology (e.g., transpiration rate, lipid and protein content), and abiotic factors (e.g., soil organic matters, pH, salinity, and temperature). Based on literature analysis, the current knowledge gaps are identified, and future research prospects are suggested. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Drinking water pollutants may affect the immune system: concerns
   regarding COVID-19 health effects
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The current coronavirus pandemic is leading to significant impacts on the planet, changing our way of life. Although the COVID-19 virus mechanisms of action and pathogenesis are still under extensive research, immune system effects are evident, leading, in many cases, to respiratory distress. Although apparent pollution reduction has been noticed by the population, environmental and human health impacts due to the increased use of plastic waste and disinfectants is concerning. One of the main routes of human exposure to pollutants is through drinking water. Thus, this point of view discusses some major contaminants in drinking water known to be immunotoxic, exploring sources and drinking water routes and emphasizing the known mechanisms of action that could likely compromise the effective immune response of humans, particularly raising concerns regarding people exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Based on a literature review, metals, plastic components, plasticizers, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances may display the potential to exacerbate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, although epidemiological studies are still required to confirm the synergistic effects between these pollutants and the virus.

TI Recent US State and Federal Drinking Water Guidelines for Per- and
   Polyfluoroalkyl Substances
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of synthetic chemicals produced for over 70 years, are of increasing concern because of their widespread environmental presence, extreme persistence, bioaccumulative nature, and evidence for health effects from environmentally relevant exposures. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established nonregulatory drinking water Health Advisories of 70 ng/L for individual and total concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the 8-carbon perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) that are the most thoroughly studied PFAS. As of May 2020, 9 US states had concluded that the USEPA Health Advisories are insufficiently protective and developed more stringent PFOA and PFOS guidelines. In addition, 10 states had developed guidelines for other PFAS, primarily PFAAs. This Critical Review discusses the scientific basis for state and USEPA drinking water guidelines for PFOA and PFOS; the same principles apply to guidelines for other PFAS. Similarities and differences among guidelines arise from both toxicity and exposure considerations. The approximately 4-fold range among state guidelines (8-35 ng/L for PFOA, 10-40 ng/L for PFOS) is not large or unexpected for guidelines developed by different scientists at different time points, especially when compared with older USEPA and state guidelines that were generally several orders of magnitude higher. Additional state guidelines for PFOA, PFOS, and other PFAS are expected to become available. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-14. (c) 2020 SETAC

TI Are concentrations of pollutants in sharks, rays and skates
   (Elasmobranchii) a cause for concern? A systematic review
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB This review represents a comprehensive analysis on pollutants in elasmobranchs including meta-analysis on the most studied pollutants: mercury, cadmium, PCBs and DDTs, in muscle and liver tissue. Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products. Wider screening studies are recommended to determine the risk to elasmobranchs from emerging pollutants and more robust studies are recommended to assess the risks to human health.

TI Genomic and Resistance Epidemiology of Gram-Negative Bacteria in Africa:
   a Systematic Review and Phylogenomic Analyses from a One Health
   Perspective
SO MSYSTEMS
AB Antibiotic resistance (AR) remains a major threat to public and animal health globally. However, AR ramifications in developing countries are worsened by limited molecular diagnostics, expensive therapeutics, inadequate numbers of skilled clinicians and scientists, and unsanitary environments. The epidemiology of Gramnegative bacteria, their AR genes, and geographical distribution in Africa are described here. Data were extracted and analyzed from English-language articles published between 2015 and December 2019. The genomes and AR genes of the various species, obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and NCBI were analyzed phylogenetically using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) and annotated with Figtree. The geographic location of resistant clones/clades was mapped manually. Thirty species from 31 countries and 24 genera from 41 countries were analyzed from 146 articles and 3,028 genomes, respectively. Genes mediating resistance to beta-lactams (including bla(TEM-1), bla(CTX-M), bla(NDM), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), and bla(OXA)(-48/181)), fluoroquinolones (oqxAB, qnrA/B/D/S, gyrA/B, and parCE mutations, etc.), aminoglycosides (including armA and rmtC/F), sulfonamides (sul1/2/3), trimethoprim (dfrA), tetracycline (ter(A/B/C/D/G/O/M/39)], colistin (rncr-1), phenicols (catA/B, crnIA), and fosfomycin (fosA) were mostly found in Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and also in Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coil, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter baumannii, etc., on mostly IncF-type, IncX(3/4), CoIRNAI, and IncR plasmids, within lnt/1 gene cassettes, insertion sequences, and transposons. Clonal and multiclonal outbreaks and dissemination of resistance genes across species and countries and between humans, animals, plants, and the environment were observed; Escherichia coil ST103, K. pneumoniae ST101, S. enterica ST1/2, and Vibrio cholerae ST69/515 were common strains. Most pathogens were of human origin, and zoonotic transmissions were relatively limited.
   IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the major public health threats and challenges to effective containment and treatment of infectious bacterial diseases worldwide. Here, we used different methods to map out the geographical hot spots, sources, and evolutionary epidemiology of AR. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Neisseria meningitis/gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, etc., were common pathogens shuttling AR genes in Africa. Transmission of the same clones/strains across countries and between animals, humans, plants, and the environment was observed. We recommend Enterobacter spp. or K. pneumoniae as better sentinel species for AR surveillance.

TI A Critical Review on Metal-Organic Frameworks and Their Composites as
   Advanced Materials for Adsorption and Photocatalytic Degradation of
   Emerging Organic Pollutants from Wastewater
SO POLYMERS
AB Water-borne emerging pollutants are among the greatest concern of our modern society. Many of these pollutants are categorized as endocrine disruptors due to their environmental toxicities. They are harmful to humans, aquatic animals, and plants, to the larger extent, destroying the ecosystem. Thus, effective environmental remediations of these pollutants became necessary. Among the various remediation techniques, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation have been single out as the most promising. This review is devoted to the compilations and analysis of the role of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites as potential materials for such applications. Emerging organic pollutants, like dyes, herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and perfluorinated alkyl substances, have been extensively studied. Important parameters that affect these processes, such as surface area, bandgap, percentage removal, equilibrium time, adsorption capacity, and recyclability, are documented. Finally, we paint the current scenario and challenges that need to be addressed for MOFs and their composites to be exploited for commercial applications.

TI Identification of Emerging Hazards in Mussels by the Galician Emerging
   Food Safety Risks Network (RISEGAL). A First Approach
SO FOODS
AB Emerging risk identification is a priority for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The goal of the Galician Emerging Food Safety Risks Network (RISEGAL) is the identification of emerging risks in foods produced and commercialized in Galicia (northwest Spain) in order to propose prevention plans and mitigation strategies. In this work, RISEGAL applied a systematic approach for the identification of emerging food safety risks potentially affecting bivalve shellfish. First, a comprehensive review of scientific databases was carried out to identify hazards most quoted as emerging in bivalves in the period 2016-2018. Then, identified hazards were semiquantitatively assessed by a panel of food safety experts, who scored them accordingly with the five evaluation criteria proposed by EFSA: novelty, soundness, imminence, scale, and severity. Scores determined that perfluorinated compounds, antimicrobial resistance, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), and antimicrobial residues are the emerging hazards that are considered most imminent and severe and that could cause safety problems of the highest scale in the bivalve value chain by the majority of the experts consulted (75%). Finally, in a preliminary way, an exploratory study carried out in the Galician Rias highlighted the presence of HEV in mussels cultivated in class B production areas.

TI Medical Interventions for Patellofemoral Pain and Patellofemoral
   Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) are common, persistent conditions that may lie along a pathological spectrum. While evidence supports exercise-therapy as a core treatment for PFP and PFOA, primary care physicians commonly prescribe medication, or refer for surgical consults in persistent cases. We conducted a systematic review of medical interventions (pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and surgical) for PFP and PFOA to inform primary care decision making. Methods: Following protocol registration, we searched seven databases for randomized clinical trials of our target interventions for PFP and PFOA. Our primary outcome was pain. We assessed risk of bias, calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) and determined the level of evidence for each intervention. Results: We included 14 publications investigating pharmaceutical or nutraceutical interventions, and eight publications investigating surgical interventions. Two randomized control trials (RCTs) provided moderate evidence of patellofemoral arthroplasty having similar pain outcomes compared to total knee arthroplasty in isolated PFOA, with SMDs ranging from -0.3 (95% CI -0.8, 0.2, Western Ontario McMaster Pain Subscale, 1 year post-surgery) to 0.3 (-0.1, 0.7, SF-36 Bodily Pain, 2 years post-surgery). Remaining studies provided, at most, limited evidence. No efficacy was demonstrated for oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or arthroscopic surgery. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical and nutraceutical prescriptions, and surgical referrals are currently being made with little supporting evidence, with some interventions showing limited efficacy. This should be considered within the broader context of evidence supporting exercise-therapy as a core treatment for PFP and PFOA.

TI Emerging disinfection byproducts: A review on their occurrence and
   control in drinking water treatment processes
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB The occurrence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) is related both to drinking water treatment (DWT) processes and to raw water's characteristics. Emerging pollutants typically occur in low concentrations and are not removed by conventional DWT processes. Emerging DBPs appear within the DWT or in the distribution system due to the combination of disinfection agents (especially chlorine) with precursors as: natural organic matter (NOM), algal organic matter (AOM), anthropogenic contaminants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, detergents etc.), brominated and iodinated compounds.
   This study has as main goal a consistent analysis of the major problems caused by emerging DBPs to drinking water supplies. It presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to emerging DBPs considering three viewpoints: 1. an overview of their classification, legislative framework, methods of analysis, disinfection operational conditions and removal processes; 2. their occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts; 3. the analysis of the advanced DWT processes that might be used for the removal and control of precursors and DBPs, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies considered pollutants removed, process conditions and efficiencies, and a critical assessment of processes based on membranes, advanced oxidation and adsorption on activated carbon or other materials. The main challenges of the control and removal of emerging DBPs are their low concentrations and the technical and economic sustainability of their application at full-scale, which need to be carefully adapted to local boundary conditions.

TI Comparison of clinical outcomes with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation
   versus InterTAN nail for intertrochanteric femoral fractures: a
   meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB Background A meta-analysis to access the pros and cons of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) versus InterTAN nail for intertrochanteric femoral fractures including available evidence extracted from literature. Methods According to the Cochrane systemic analysis method, randomized control trials (RCTs) and retrospective comparative observational studies which were related to the comparison of PFNA and InterTAN nail in the treatment of the elderly with intertrochanteric fractures were retrieved. Data were independently extracted from the included studies by two reviewers and analyzed using RevMan 5.3, and the quality of the studies was assessed. Results Two RCTs and seven observational studies were recruited, which consisted of 681 patients with PFNA and 651 patients with InterTAN nail. The meta-analyses showed no significant differences between the two approaches on Harris Hip Score, operation time, blood loss, time to union, mean hospital stay, union problems, intraoperative complications, hematoma, infection, and other complications in both RCTs and observational studies. In terms of other outcomes, for the RCTs, results showed that there were shorter tip-apex distance and reduced pain at thigh or hip in InterTAN nail than in PFNA; however, InterTAN nail was not superior to PFNA in cutout, reoperation, and femoral shaft fracture; for observational studies, the risk of the screw migration (RR = 5.13, 95%CI [1.33,19.75], P = 0.02), cutout (RR = 3.26, 95%CI [1.64,6.47], P = 0.0008), the varus collapse of the femoral head (RR = 7.19, 95%CI [2.18,23.76], P = 0.001), femoral shaft fracture (RR = 5.73, 95%CI [2.24,14.65], P = 0.0003) treated by InterTAN nail were significantly decreased, compared with those by PFNA; however, no significant differences were observed in the aspects of tip-apex distance and pain at thigh or hip between these two groups. Conclusion Analysis of a large number of relevant clinical indicators available shows that InterTAN nail has better clinical manifestation than PFNA in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures.

TI Nickel-Catalyzed Four-Component Carbocarbonylation of Alkenes under 1
   atm of CO
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Transition-metal-catalyzed carbonylation is one of the most straightforward strategies to prepare carbonyl compounds. However, compared to well-established noble-metal-catalyzed carbonylation reactions, analogue coupling via base-metal, nickel catalysis has received less attention because of the easy formation of highly toxic and unreactive Ni(CO)(4) species between Ni(0) and CO. To date, the use of inexpensive and widely available carbon monoxide (CO) gas for nickel-catalyzed carbonylation reaction remains challenging, and nickel-catalyzed four-component carbonylative reaction has not been reported yet. Here, we report a highly selective nickel-catalyzed four-component carbocarbonylation of alkenes under 1 atm (1 atm) of CO gas to efficiently achieve an array of complex carbonyl compounds, including fluorinated amino acids and oligopeptides of great interest in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. This reaction relies on a nickel-catalyzed one-pot cascade process to assemble CO, arylboronic acids, and difluoroalkyl electrophiles across the carbon-carbon double bond of alkenes, paving a new way for base-metal-catalyzed carbonylative cascade reaction.Y

TI Are Fluoropolymers Really of Low Concern for Human and Environmental
   Health and Separate from Other PFAS?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Fluoropolymers are a group of polymers within the class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the evidence regarding the environmental and human health impacts of fluoropolymers throughout their life cycle(s). Production of some fluoropolymers is intimately linked to the use and emissions of legacy and novel PFAS as polymer processing aids. There are serious concerns regarding the toxicity and adverse effects of fluorinated processing aids on humans and the environment. A variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomers, are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of fluoropolymers. There are further concerns regarding the safe disposal of fluoropolymers and their associated products and articles at the end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluoropolymers is performed on some industrial waste, there are only limited options for their recycling from consumer articles. The evidence reviewed in this analysis does not find a scientific rationale for concluding that fluoropolymers are of low concern for environmental and human health. Given fluoropolymers' extreme persistence; emissions associated with their production, use, and disposal; and a high likelihood for human exposure to PFAS, their production and uses should be curtailed except in cases of essential uses.

TI Oxalic Acid in Root Exudates Enhances Accumulation of Perfluorooctanoic
   Acid in Lettuce
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is bioaccumulative in crops. PFOA bioaccumulation potential varies largely among crop varieties. Root exudates are found to be associated with such variations. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in root exudates from a PFOA-high-accumulation lettuce variety are observed significantly higher than those from PFOA-low-accumulation lettuce variety (p < 0.05). Root exudates and their LMWOAs components exert great influences on the linear sorption-desorption isotherms of PFOA in soils, thus activating PFOA and enhancing its bioavailability. Among root exudate components, oxalic acid is identified to play a key role in activating PFOA uptake, with >80% attribution. Oxalic acid at rhizospheric concentrations (0.02-0.5 mM) can effectively inhibit PFOA sorption to soils by decreasing hydrophobic force, electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange, and cation-bridge effect. Oxalic acid enhances dissolution of metallic ions, iron/aluminum oxides, and organic matters from soils and forms oxalate-metal complexes, based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, ultraviolet spectra, and analyses of metal ions, iron/aluminum organometallic complexes, and dissolved organic carbon. The findings not only reveal the activation process of PFOA in soils by root exudates, particularly oxalic acid at rhizospheric concentrations, but also give an insight into the mechanism of enhancing PFOA accumulation in lettuce varieties.

TI Pelvic floor: vaginal or caesarean delivery? A review of systematic
   reviews
SO INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Introduction and hypothesis In recent years the number of caesarean sections has increased worldwide for different reasons. to review the scientific evidence relating to the impact of the type of delivery on pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) such as urinary and faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Methods A review of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, drawn from the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and LILACS (Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud/Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) prior to January 2019. The directives of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were used in assessing article quality. Results Eleven systematic reviews were evaluated, 6 of which found a significantly decreased risk of urinary incontinence associated with caesarean section and 3 meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in POP for caesarean section, compared with vaginal delivery. Of 5 reviews that examined delivery type and faecal incontinence, only one indicated a lower incidence of faecal incontinence associated with caesarean delivery. However, most of the studies included in these reviews were not adjusted for important confounding factors and the risk of PFDs was not analysed by category of caesarean delivery (elective or urgent). Conclusion When compared with vaginal delivery, caesarean is associated with a reduced risk of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. These results should be interpreted with caution and do not help to address the question of whether elective caesareans are protective of the maternal pelvic floor.

TI Environmental levels and human body burdens of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
   substances in Africa: A critical review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known organic pollutants with adverse health effects on humans and the ecosystem. This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic add (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Early-life exposure to widespread environmental toxicants and
   maternal-fetal health risk: A focus on metabolomic biomarkers
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Prenatal exposure to widespread environmental toxicants is detrimental to maternal health and fetal development. The effects of environmental toxicants on maternal and fetal metabolic profile changes have not yet been summarized. This systematic review aims to summarize the current studies exploring the association between prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants and metabolic profile alterations in mother and fetus. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature conducted up to September 18, 2019 with some key terms. From the initial 155 artides, 15 artides met the inclusion and exclusion aiteria, and consist of highly heterogeneous research methods. Seven studies assessed the effects of multiple environmental pollutants (metals, organic pollutants, nicotine, air pollutants) on the maternal urine and blood metabolomic profile; five studies evaluated the effects of arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nicotine, and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the cord blood metabolomic profile; and one study assessed the effects of smoking exposure on the amniotic fluid metabolomic profile. The alteration of metabolic pathways in these studies mainly involve energy metabolism, hormone metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. No population study investigated the association between environmental toxicants and placental metabolomics. This systematic review provides evidence that prenatal exposure to a variety of environmental pollutants can affect maternal and fetal metabolomic characteristics. Integration of environmental toxicant exposure and metabolomics data in maternal-fetal samples is helpful to understand the interaction between toxicants and metabolites, so as to reveal the pathogenesis of fetal disease or diseases of fetal origin.

TI Fluorometer for Screening of Doxorubicin in Perfusate Solution and
   Tissue with Solid-Phase Microextraction Chemical Biopsy Sampling
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The recent development of an in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method capable of analyzing drugs and metabolic products in biofluids and living tissues holds great promise. The standard in vivo SPME protocol based on mass spectrometry is a very powerful analytical approach, but it is not practical for on-site analysis in many cases. In this paper, we present a fluorescence-based SPME method and a prototype of a portable fluorometer that is capable of quickly quantifying concentrations of the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The instrument uses thin coated, biocompatible SPME fibers, which we have previously presented as a chemical biopsy tool for use during in vivo lung perfusion (IVLP) procedures within a hospital setting. In this research, we test SPME fibers with C8-SCX, C18, and HLB coatings with our fluorometer. The mixed-mode C8-SCX fibers showed the best sensitivity of the three and were therefore used to examine DOX extraction from perfusate solution and a homogenized lamb lung tissue. The maximum concentration of free active sites in the C8-SCX fiber and the adsorption equilibrium constant were determined to be (9.1 +/- 0.3) x 10(-7) mol m(-2) and 420 +/- 30 m(3) mol(-1), respectively. Finally, the detection limits for DOX extracted from buffer, perfusate, and lung tissue were 40, 100, and 3700 mu g L-1, respectively.

TI Microtubule Cytoskeleton and Spermatogenesis-Lesson From Studies of
   Toxicant Models
SO TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Studies have shown that mammalian testes, in particular the Sertoli cells, are highly susceptible to exposure of environmental toxicants, such as cadmium, perfluorooctanesulfonate, phthalates, 2,5-hexanedione and bisphenol A. However, important studies conducted by reproductive toxicologists and/or biologists in the past have been treated as toxicology reports per se. Yet, many of these studies provided important mechanistic insights on the toxicant-induced testis injury and reproductive dysfunction, relevant to the biology of the testis and spermatogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that findings obtained from toxicant models are exceedingly helpful tools to unravel the biology of testis function in particular spermatogenesis, including specific cellular events associated with spermatid transport to support spermiogenesis and spermiation. In this review, we critically evaluate some recent data, focusing primarily on the molecular structure and role of microtubules in cellular function, illustrating the importance of toxicant models to unravel the biology of microtubule cytoskeleton in supporting spermatogenesis, well beyond information on toxicology. These findings have opened up some potential areas of research which should be carefully evaluated in the years to come.

TI Functional traits in macrophyte studies: Current trends and future
   research agenda
SO AQUATIC BOTANY
AB The use of functional traits (FTs) can provide quantitative information to explain macrophyte ecology more effectively than traditional taxonomic-based methods. This research aims to elucidate the trait-based approaches used in recent macrophyte studies to outline their applications, shortcomings, and future challenges. A systematic literature review focused on macrophytes and FTs was carried out on Scopus database (last accessed May 2020). The latest 520 papers published from 2010 to 2020, which represent 70 % of the whole literature selected since 1969, were carefully screened. Reviewed studies mainly investigated: 1) the role of FTs in shaping communities; 2) the responses of macrophytes to environmental gradients; 3) the application of FTs in monitoring anthropic pressures; and 4) the reasons for success of invasive species. Studied areas were concentrated in Europe (41 %) and Asia (32 %), overlooking other important biodiversity hotspots, and only 6.2 % of the world macrophytes species were investigated in dedicated single species studies. The FTs most commonly used include leaf economic and morphological traits, and we noticed a lack of attention on root traits and in general on spatial traits patterns, as well as a relatively poor understanding of how FTs mediate biotic interactions. Highthroughput techniques, such as remote sensing, allow to map fine-scale variability of selected traits within and across systems, helping to clarify multiple links of FTs with ecological drivers and processes. We advise to promote investigations on root traits, and to push forward the integration of multiple approaches to better clarify the role of macrophytes at multiple scales.

TI Endoscopic stapes surgery outcomes and complication rates: a systematic
   review
SO EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
AB Objective These days, the gold standard procedure for otosclerosis treatment is stapes surgery. The endoscopic approach of the procedure is gaining popularity as endoscopic ear surgery develops across the globe. The main objective of this study is to gather and compile well-documented and reliable data regarding surgical outcomes for the endoscopic approach to stapes surgery up to this date. Materials and methods Publications in English were searched in the PUBMED/MEDLINE database and were systematically reviewed. A total of 16 articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria, obtaining a total of 573 patients managed surgically for otosclerosis, using an endoscopic approach. Data were systematically extracted and compared across variables. Results Data were obtained as follows: mean age of 43 years; female proportion of 60%; 3 mm endoscope diameter of 51%, 4 mm of 39%; titanium piston-type prostheses of 52% and Teflon of 48%; length of the prosthesis (mode) was 4.5 mm; 0.6 mm diameter of the piston of 81% and 0.4 mm of 19%; mean surgical time was 55 min. Hearing results, mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) 31 dB; mean postoperative ABG 9 dB; ABG improvement of 22 dB; an ABG closure rate to 20 dB or less of 92% and an ABG closure rate to 10 dB or less of 77%. Complication rates: intraoperative tympanic membrane perforation of 5%; postoperative vertigo of 11%; postoperative dysgeusia of 10%; reported a postoperative neurosensorial hearing loss of 0.2%; reported gusher phenomenon of one case (0.2%). Conclusion Endoscopic stapes surgery is completely achievable using 0o angle and 4-mm-diameter sinus surgery endoscope. Instrument availability should not be an obstacle to the development of this type of surgery in any otolaryngology department. Audiological outcomes are comparable to microscopic approaches.

   using multifunctional materials:a review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have gained heightened attentions in recent years owing to their persistent property and hazard influence on wild life and human beings. Removal of POPs using varieties of multifunctional materials have shown a promising prospect compared with conventional treatments. Herein, three main categories, including thermal degradation, electrochemical remediation, as well as photocatalytic degradation with the use of diverse catalytic materials, especially the recently developed prominent ones were comprehensively reviewed. Kinetic analysis and underlying mechanism for various POPs degradation processes were addressed in detail. The review also systematically documented how catalytic performance was dramatically affected by the nature of the material itself, the structure of target pollutants, reaction conditions and treatment techniques. Moreover, the future challenges and prospects of POPs degradation by means of multiple multifunctional materials were outlined accordingly. Knowing this is of immense significance to enhance our understanding of POPs remediation procedures and promote the development of novel multifunctional materials. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI On-line microcolumn-based dynamic leaching method for investigation of
   lead bioaccessibility in shooting range soils
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB In this work, a miniaturized flow-through leaching test is presented for rapid screening of potential chemical extractants to explore the bioaccessibility of lead (Pb) in contaminated shooting range soils in Valkeala, Finland. The method combines the versatility of microcolumn-based extraction methods with on-line inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) analysis for expedient assessment of the magnitude of the bioaccessible pools and the leaching kinetics of lead from polluted soils under variable physicochemical scenarios. Acids and salt solutions were studied as potential extractants. The efficiency of the extractants relative to the initial total amount of lead in the soil sample (509 +/- 21 mg/kg) were found to increase in the following order: 0.11 M acetic acid (55%) < 1 M MgCl2 (58%) < 0.1 M NH2OH center dot HCl (61%) < 0.1 M citric acid (93%) < 0.1 M HCl (96%). The proposed on-line microcolumn-based method was further explored for implementation of the modified BCR (now termed Standards, Measurements and Testing Programme, SM&T) sequential extraction procedure to avail the information about different fractions available in the solid sample, and validated by mass balance calculations. The equivalent sequential procedure in a batch format was then studied and compared against the on-line microcolumn extraction method.
   The on-line dynamic extraction system presented in this work accepts a substantial amount of sample (2.5 g) as compared to previous flow-through mini-column setups (generally accommodating < 0.25 g of sample), thus maintaining sample representativeness and fostering comprehension of the extraction patterns for non-homogenous soil materials. The use of cotton buds and Teflon membranes and holders in the microcolumn setup facilitates the repeatable flow-through leaching of trace elements and restrict formation of preferential channels. Monitoring of the leachable trace elements in real time delivers detailed insight into the ongoing extraction process and provides a time-saving assessment of potential chemical extractants.

TI Urbanization in China is associated with pronounced perturbation of
   plasma metabolites
SO METABOLOMICS
AB Introduction Urbanization is associated with major changes in environmental and lifestyle exposures that may influence metabolic signatures. Objectives We investigated cross-sectional urban and rural differences in plasma metabolome analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry platform in 500 Chinese adults aged 25-68 years from two neighboring southern Chinese provinces. Methods We first examined the overall metabolome differences by urban and rural residential location, using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest classification. We then tested the association between urbanization status and individual metabolites using a linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and province and conducted pathway analysis (Fisher's exact test) to identify metabolic pathways differed by urbanization status. Results We observed distinct overall metabolome by urbanization status in OPLS-DA and random forest classification. Using linear regression, out of a total of 1108 unique metabolite features identified in this sample, we found that 266 metabolites were differed by urbanization status (positive false discovery rate-adjusted p-value, q-value < 0.05). For example, the following metabolites were positively associated with urbanization status: caffeine metabolites from xanthine metabolism, hazardous pollutants like 4-hydroxychlorothalonil and perfluorooctanesulfonate, and metabolites implicated in cardiometabolic diseases, such as branched-chain amino acids. In pathway analysis, we found that xanthine metabolism pathways differed by urbanization status (q-value = 1.64E-04). Conclusion We detected profound differences in host metabolites by urbanization status. Urban residents were characterized by metabolites signaling caffeine metabolism and toxic pollutants and metabolites on known pathways to cardiometabolic disease risks, compared to their rural counterparts. Our findings highlight the importance of considering urbanization in metabolomics analysis.

TI Updates on molecular and environmental determinants of luteal
   progesterone production
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Progesterone, a critical hormone in reproduction, is a key sex steroid in the establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy and serves as an intermediary for synthesis of other steroid hormones. Progesterone production from the corpus luteum is a tightly regulated process which is stimulated and maintained by multiple factors, both systemic and local. Multiple regulatory systems, including classic mediators of gonadotropin stimulation such as the cAMP/PKA pathway and TGFp-mediated signaling pathways, as well as local production of hormonal factors, exist to promote granulosa cell function and physiological fine-tuning of progesterone levels. In this manuscript, we provide an updated narrative review of the known mediators of human luteal progesterone and highlight new observations regarding this important process, focusing on studies published within the last five years. We will also review recent evidence suggesting that this complex system of progesterone production is sensitive to disruption by exogenous environmental chemicals that can mimic or interfere with the activities of endogenous hormones.

TI Recent progress in adsorptive removal of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) from water/wastewater
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Due to chemical and physiological inertness and wide usage in nearly every aspect of our daily life, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now ubiquitous in the environment, including drinking water sources. As most biological and chemical destruction methods have so far shown limited efficiencies, adsorption, a simple and cost-effective treatment, is widely adopted for the removal of PFAS from water/wastewater. This paper aims to review the recent progress in PFAS adsorption using various adsorbents. The performance of different types of adsorbents, including the traditional carbonaceous materials and resins as well as the newly-synthesized minerals, biomaterials, and polymers, in PFAS removal was summarized. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms were critically reviewed. Real-life adsorption applications (large-scale setups, adsorption-involved treatment trains and point-of-use/point-of-entry systems) were also examined. Learned lessons, current challenges and recommendations on future research were provided regarding results of tests in real environmental matrices, pilot and/or field scale studies of promising newly-developed adsorbents, and the improvement of the removal of alternative PFAS (mostly short-chained ones).

TI MSC-based therapy in female pelvic floor disorders
SO CELL AND BIOSCIENCE
AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also referred to as multipotent stromal cells or mesenchymal stromal cells, are present in multiple tissues and capable of differentiating into diverse cell lineages, holding a great promise in developing cell-based therapy for a wide range of conditions. Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is a common degenerative disease in women and may diminish a woman's quality of life at any age. Since the treatments for this disease are limited by the high rates of recurrence and surgical complications, seeking an ideal therapy in the restoration of pelvic floor function is an urgent issue at present. Herein, we summarize the cell sources of MSCs used for PFDs and discuss the potential mechanisms of MSCs in treating PFDs. Specifically, we also provide a comprehensive review of current preclinical and clinical trials dedicated to investigating MSC-based therapy for PFDs. The novel therapy has presented promising therapeutic effects which include relieving the symptoms of urinary or fecal incontinence, improving the biological properties of implanted meshes and promoting the injured tissue repair. Nevertheless, MSC-based therapies for PFDs are still experimental and the unstated issues on their safety and efficacy should be carefully addressed before their clinical applications.

TI Optimal surgical methods to treat intertrochanteric fracture: a Bayesian
   network meta-analysis based on 36 randomized controlled trials
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB BackgroundThere are several surgical methods to treat intertrochanteric fracture: dynamic hip screw (DHS), compression hip screw (CHS), percutaneous compression plate (PCCP), Medoff sliding plate, less invasive stabilization system (LISS), Gamma nail, proximal femoral nail (PFN), and proximal femoral nail anti-rotating (PFNA). We therefore conducted a network meta-analysis to compare eight surgical interventions, including DHS, CHS, PCCP, Medoff sliding plate, LISS, Gamma nail, PFN, and PFNA, to provide the optimal surgical intervention for intertrochanteric fracture.MethodsAn electronic search of 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science) from inception to July 2020. Two or more of the eight surgical interventions, including the DHS, CHS, PCCP, Medoff sliding plate, LISS, Gamma nail, PFN, and PFNA, for intertrochanteric fracture were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (ROB) tool. Network meta-analysis was conducted by using R-3.5.1 software with the help of package "gemtc". The odd ratios (ORs) with 95% credibility interval (CrI) were used to assess complications and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CrI to calculate the continuous outcomes (operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and Harris hip score). Surfaces under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) were used to rank the intervention.ResultsA total of 36 RCTs were included in this study. The results of this network meta-analysis showed that, compared with the CHS and DHS group, PFNA exhibited a beneficial role in reducing the blood loss (SMD, 152.50; 95% CrI, 72.93 to 232.45; and SMD, 184.40; 95% CrI, 132.99 to 235.90, respectively). PFNA achieved the lowest value for the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for the blood loss (SURCA = 0.072) and highest of Harris hip score (SURCA = 0.912). PCCP may have the lowest probability of the operative time (SURCA = 0.095). There were no significant differences among the eight surgical procedures in complications.ConclusionPFNA technique is the optimal treatment method for intertrochanteric fracture. Larger, longitudinal RCTs addressing current limitations, including sources of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, are needed to provide more robust and consistent evidence.

TI Assessment of transcriptomic constraint-based methods for central carbon
   flux inference
SO PLOS ONE
AB Motivation Determining intracellular metabolic flux through isotope labeling techniques such as(13)C metabolic flux analysis (C-13-MFA) incurs significant cost and effort. Previous studies have shown transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling can determine intracellular fluxes that correlate highly with(13)C-MFA measured fluxes and can achieve higher accuracy than constraint-based metabolic modeling alone. These studies, however, used validation data limited toE.coliandS.cerevisiaegrown on glucose, with significantly similar flux distribution for central metabolism. It is unclear whether those results apply to more diverse metabolisms, and therefore further, extensive validation is needed. Results In this paper, we formed a dataset of transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding(13)C-MFA flux data for 21 experimental conditions in different unicellular organisms grown on varying carbon substrates and conditions. Three computational flux-balance analysis (FBA) methods were comparatively assessed. The results show when uptake rates of carbon sources and key metabolites are known, transcriptomic data provides no significant advantage over constraint-based metabolic modeling (average correlation coefficients, transcriptomic E-Flux2 0.725 and SPOT 0.650 vs non-transcriptomic pFBA 0.768). When uptake rates are unknown, however, predictions obtained utilizing transcriptomic data are generally good and significantly better than those obtained using constraint-based metabolic modeling alone (E-Flux2 0.385 and SPOT 0.583 vs pFBA 0.237). Thus, transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling is a promising method to obtain intracellular flux estimates in microorganisms, particularly in cases where uptake rates of key metabolites cannot be easily determined, such as for growth in complex media orin vivoconditions.

TI Evidence-Based Women's Health Physical Therapy Across the Lifespan
SO CURRENT PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION REPORTS
AB Purpose of ReviewThe aim of this paper is to review the current evidence for physical therapy (PT) in the treatment of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) in women throughout the female lifespan.Recent FindingsAlthough trials are small and heterogeneous, there is an increase in evidence to support PT as a safe, effective treatment option for women with PFDs at various life stages. Evidence to support PT interventions for pelvic floor conditions including dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause are discussed. Clinicians are recommended to consider prevention and wellness strategies to promote pelvic health for women and screen for PFDs for early intervention.SummaryAt various stages along the lifespan, a woman may be at risk for PFDs, impacting function, and quality of life. Knowledge of the potential risk factors based on a women's history and life stage to appropriately screen for PFDs may facilitate early intervention. Pelvic health PT is considered to be a low risk, effective treatment option for women with PFDs. Future research is needed to determine longer term outcomes and potential prevention strategies for women on a larger scale.

TI Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects
   on the ovary
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE
AB BACKGROUND Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are found widespread in drinking water, foods, food packaging materials and other consumer products. Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health.
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function.
   SEARCH METHODS A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms.
   OUTCOMES Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality.

TI Occurrence, fate, sources and toxicity of PFAS: What we know so far in
   Florida and major gaps
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that have been the subject of several investigations worldwide due to their persistence and significant adverse health effects to humans and animals. In Florida, high PFAS levels have been detected in the ground water, surface water, soils and sediments near military bases, airports, and firefighting training facilities. Recently, a drinking water assessment conducted by the EWG has identified Miami, Florida as the U.S city with the third highest levels of PFAS among 44 locations assessed. This critical review presents a summary of the recent literature, databases, and investigations of PFAS contamination in Florida, focusing on PFAS occurrence, major sources and treatment methods. The major PFAS sources identified are divided into the usage of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), landfills, and wastewater treatment plants. Despite the lack of comprehensive studies in Florida, toxicity concerns are also discussed. Major knowledge gaps and future research needs are considered. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Current state and future perspectives of engineered and artificial
   peroxygenases for the oxyfunctionalization of organic molecules
SO NATURE CATALYSIS
AB Peroxygenases are attractive biocatalysts for the selective introduction of oxygen into organic molecules under mild conditions with hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen source. In addition to the identification of primary peroxygenases, different classes of enzymes were shown to display promiscuous peroxygenase activity. Even though enzymes with peroxygenase activity are promising industrial biocatalysts, further optimization of their properties is required for their effective use in industrial applications. Here we give a comprehensive overview of enzymes with peroxygenase activity and review diverse strategies, including directed evolution, rational approaches and the assistance of small functional molecules to improve the expression, catalytic activity, substrate scope or selectivity of these promising enzymes. Furthermore, we discuss the exploration of modified or unnatural cofactors to design artificial peroxygenases for desired reactions. The rapidly expanding field of hydrogen peroxide-utilizing enzymes bears a great potential to provide biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization chemistry, contributing to the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable oxidation processes.
   Peroxygenases are promising enzymes to contribute to more environmentally friendly and sustainable oxidation reactions in industry. This Review Article gives a comprehensive overview about enzymes with peroxygenase activity and strategies to engineer them for desired reactions and enhanced performances.

TI Metagenomic analysis of soil microbial community under PFOA and PFOS
   stress
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) contamination of soil has attracted global attention in recent years but influences of PFCs on microorganisms in the soil environment have not been fully described. In this study, the effects of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) on bacterial communities were determined by Illumina Miseq sequencing and Illumina Hiseq Xten. The stimulation of PFCs pollutants on soil bacterial richness and community diversity were observed. Sequencing information indicated that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes were the dominant bacterial phyla. Two genera, Bacillus and Sphingomonas, exhibited adverse responses toward PFCs pollution. Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and NCBI databases were used to elucidate the proteins and function action of soil microbial to PFCs pollution. Pathways such as Carbohydrate metabolism, Global and overview maps and Membrane transport in the soil microbes were affected by PFCs stress. CAZy analysis revealed that glycosyl transferases (GTs) in PFCs-polluted soils showed more active, while glycoside hydrolases (GHs) were inhibited severely.

TI Biomonitoring in firefighters for volatile organic compounds,
   semivolatile organic compounds, persistent organic pollutants, and
   metals: A systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Firefighters are exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to combustion, with numerous biomonitoring studies completed that have assessed exposure. Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial.

SO JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY
AB A 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-3-oxide-1-oxyl lithium derivative was found to react with 5,6,7,8-tetrafluoro- or 5,7,8-trifluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)quinoline-N-oxides with the formation of products of aromatic nucleophilic substitution of the H atom at position 2 of the quinoline ring. The reaction regioselectivity is supported by the data of quantum-chemical calculations. Molecular and crystal structures of the obtained nitronyl nitroxides were solved by monocrystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and the nature of the radical was ascertained by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Heterospin complexes of Cu(hfac)(2) with the synthesized quinoline-substituted nitronyl nitroxides were prepared. According to X-ray diffraction analysis, seven-membered metallocycles are formed in the complexes owing to simultaneous coordination of the nitroxyl and N-oxide groups by the Cu atom.

TI A review of the in fluences of microplastics on toxicity and
   transgenerational effects of pharmaceutical and personal care products
   in aquatic environment
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB PPCPs (pharmaceutical and personal care products) and microplastics (MPs) are two types of emerging pollutants that are ubiquitous and widely concerned in the environment. Both of them can accumulate in fish or aquatic invertebrates and transfer to offspring, thereby producing toxic effects on both parents and offspring, in which the characteristics of MPs also enable them to adsorb PPCPs thus producing carrier effects. In this study, we have conducted a comprehensive review of MPs and PPCPs and found that MPs can act as a carrier of PPCPs to influence the bioaccumulation of PPCPs. MPs and PPCPs have toxicity and transgenerational effects on both fish and aquatic invertebrates in many aspects, and MPs can also affect the toxicity and transgenerational effects of PPCPs due to their carrier effects. This paper revealed that MPs may have an important impact on the bioavailability of PPCPs and the interaction between MPs and PPCPs is a hot topic in future research. This study also puts forward the shortcomings of the current research and related suggestions, and relevant research should be carried out as soon as possible to provide the basis for the prevention and treatment of fresh water.

TI Uptake, accumulation and metabolism of PFASs in plants and health
   perspectives: A critical review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are man-made persistent organic compounds of significant health and environmental concern because of their resistance to degradation, tendency for global transport, and ability to bioaccumulate. The widespread use and stability of PFASs provide many opportunities for human exposure to these contaminants. In recent years, our understanding of PFASs as contaminants in vegetation has increased considerably. PFASs are taken up, transformed and accumulated in various compartments of plants, and the rate of these processes depends on environmental conditions, compound-specific characteristics, plant species, and other competing factors. This review summarizes the recent findings on the uptake, accumulation, distribution and metabolism of PFASs in higher plants, with a specific focus on plant metabolism pathways of representative polyfluoroalkyl compounds. The potential risk of PFASs in plant-origin food for human exposure is also discussed. Further studies on plant metabolism of polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are in urgent need to fill the data gaps and allow a comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism pathways. Additional research questions are proposed, including the behavior and fate of new PFASs and PFOS/PFOA replacements in environmental systems in the presence of plants, and the phytoremediation potential of different plant species.

TI Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and Their Effects on the Placenta,
   Pregnancy, and Child Development: a Potential Mechanistic Role for
   Placental Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs)
SO CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS
AB Purpose of Review This review summarizes studies highlighting perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their effects on the placenta, pregnancy outcomes, and child health. It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms. This review summarizes how PFAS, critical environmental contaminants, may contribute to diseases of pregnancy as well as early and later child health.

   systematic review of the epidemiological evidence
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS
AB Exposure to environmental pollutants may produce impairment of male reproductive health. The epidemiological literature evaluating potential consequences of human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has grown in recent years with concerns for both pre- and postnatal influences. The aim of this systematic review was to assess available evidence on associations between PFAS exposures in different stages of life and semen quality, reproductive hormones, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. A systematic search of literature published prior to March 9th, 2020, was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase (R). Predefined criteria for eligibility were applied by two authors screening study records independently. Among the 242 study records retrieved in the literature search, 26 studies were eligible for qualitative assessment. While several investigations suggested weak associations for single compounds and specific outcomes, a lack of consistency across studies limited conclusions of overall evidence. The current gap in knowledge is particularly obvious regarding exposures prior to adulthood, exposure to combinations of both PFAS and other types of environmental chemicals, and outcomes such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer. Continued efforts to clarify associations between PFAS exposure and male reproductive health through high-quality epidemiological studies are needed.

AB A comprehensive review of the kinetic models for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with cobalt and iron catalysts was developed. Various kinetic models have been proposed to predict the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction behavior, as well as to study the products distribution under the use of cobalt and iron-based catalysts, with different configurations of catalytic supports and promoters. The kinetic models that have been addressed today range from the simplest based on the power-law formulation to the most complex ones based on the formulation of rigorous reaction mechanisms, such as those of Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson.

TI Use of natural sorbents as alternative and green extractive materials: A
   critical review
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB The increasing concern about environmental degradation and resource depletion has inspired the analytical chemistry community to develop analytical methods that comply as much as possible with the principles of Green Analytical Chemistry. Significant progress has been made in greening sample preparation strategies by miniaturizing sampling devices and decreasing the amount of sorptive phase needed for efficient extraction of targeted molecules. In this context, the use of natural sorbents represents an additional and convenient option for green sample preparation. The advantages of using natural sorbents for extraction include their availability from renewable sources, low toxicity and biodegradability. In this review, we describe the use of various natural sorbents for metals and organic molecules extraction, focusing on the most innovative applications within the decade 2009-2019. Particular emphasis is given to the description of commonly used biopolymers - e.g. cellulose, chitin, and lignin - and their use in a variety of sample preparation strategies. We also refer to different functionalization approaches that enhance the extraction efficiency of natural sorbents. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A critical review on recent proton exchange membranes applied in
   microbial fuel cells for renewable energy recovery
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper proposes a critical review of the proton exchange membranes currently available or under development for use in batch-mode microbial fuel cell (MFC) systems in order to suggest a suitable cost-effective membrane in terms of energy recovery. To prepare the present review, the relevant papers were identified by searching the Scopus database and extracting papers from 2007 to 2020. There is a wide variety of different membranes, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Perfluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes were evaluated based on different properties, including proton conductivity, power density (PD), water uptake, and ion exchange capacity. Results reveal that non-fluorinated membranes such as sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), graphene oxide/SPEEK (GO/SPEEK), polyethersulfone (PES) and polysulfone (PS) and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (S-OPBI) are a good choice to replace the commonly used membrane Nafion (TM) because of their lower cost and higher energy recovery. Sulfonated membranes such as polyethersulfone/SPEEK (PES/SPEEK) and Sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) show the highest normalized energy recovery. Although Nafion (TM) has the highest proton conductivity and is an excellent choice as proton exchange membrane (PEM) for MFCs, its energy recovery capacity is lower than that of porous and microfiltration membranes. It can also be very sensitive to biofouling. In the following, different parameters of membrane characterization and also wastewater treatment are discussed. The energy recovery of the membranes and systems studied was measured in order to recommend a suitable membrane for MFCs to improve the efficiency of these systems in terms of clean electricity generation and wastewater treatment.

TI Anesthetic Considerations in Facial Transplantation: Experience at NYU
   Langone Health and Systematic Review
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
AB Background: Anesthetic considerations are integral to the success of facial transplantation (FT), yet limited evidence exists to guide quality improvement. This study presents an institutional anesthesia protocol, defines reported anesthetic considerations, and provides a comprehensive update to inform future directions of the field.
   Methods: An institutional "FT Anesthesia Protocol" was developed and applied to 2 face transplants. A systematic review of 3 databases captured FTs in the peer-reviewed literature up to February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to include all clinical articles with FT recipient and/or donor-specific preoperative, intraoperative, and relevant postoperative anesthetic variables. Data charting guided a narrative synthesis, and quantitative synthesis reported variables as median (range).
   Results: Our institutional experience emphasizes the importance of on-site rehearsals, anticipation of patient-specific anesthetic and resuscitative requirements, and long-term pain management. Systematic search identified 1092 unique records, and 129 met inclusion criteria. Reports of 37 FTs in the literature informed the following anesthetic axes: donor pre- and intraoperative management during facial allograft procurement, recipient perioperative care, immunotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and pain management. Quantitative synthesis of 30 articles showed a median operative time of 18 hours (range, 9-28) and fluid replacement with 13 L (5-18) of crystalloids, 13 units (0-66) of packed red blood cells, 10 units (0-63) of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit (0-9) of platelets.
   Conclusions: Anesthetic considerations in FT span the continuum of care. Future efforts should guide standard reporting to establish evidence-based strategies that promote quality improvement and patient safety.

TI Disposable and Low-Cost Electrode Based on Graphene Paper-Nafion-Bi
   Nanostructures for Ultra-Trace Determination of Pb(II) and Cd(II)
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB There is a huge demand for rapid, reliable and low-cost methods for the analysis of heavy metals in drinking water, particularly in the range of sub-part per billion (ppb). In the present work, we describe the preparation, characterization and analytical performance of the disposable sensor to be employed in Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV) for ultra-trace simultaneous determination of cadmium and lead. The electrode consists of graphene paper-perfluorosulfonic ionomer-bismuth nano-composite material. The electrode preparation implies a key step aimed to enhance the Bi(3+)adsorption into nafion film, prior to the bismuth electro-deposition. Finely dispersed bismuth nanoparticles embedded in the ionomer film are obtained. The electrode was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The electrode shows a linear response in the 5-100 ppb range, a time-stability tested up to almost three months, and detection limits up to 0.1 ppb for both Pb(2+)and Cd2+. The electrode preparation method is simple and low in cost and the obtained analytical performance is very competitive with the state of art for the SWASV determination of Pb(2+)and Cd(2+)in solution.

TI In silicoco-factor balance estimation using constraint-based modelling
   informs metabolic engineering inEscherichia coli
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as "factories" that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells' native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termedco-factor balance, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and theEscherichia coli(E.coli) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on the final product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074-1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by(13)C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.

TI Environmental exposures and breast cancer risk in the context of
   underlying susceptibility: A systematic review of the epidemiological
   literature
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background: The evidence evaluating environmental chemical exposures (ECE) and breast cancer (BC) risk is heterogeneous which may stem in part as few studies measure ECE during key BC windows of susceptibility (WOS). Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE.
   Objectives: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3).
   Methods:We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019.
   Results: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes.
   Discussion: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk.

TI Maternal exposure to a human relevant mixture of persistent organic
   pollutants reduces colorectal carcinogenesis in A/J Min/ plus mice
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB An increased risk of developing colorectal cancer has been associated with exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and alteration in the gut bacterial community. However, there is limited understanding about the impact of maternal exposure to POPs on colorectal cancer and gut microbiota. This study characterized the influence of exposure to a human relevant mixture of POPs during gestation and lactation on colorectal cancer, intestinal metabolite composition and microbiota in the A/J Min/+ mouse model. Surprisingly, the maternal POP exposure decreased colonic tumor burden, as shown by light microscopy and histopathological evaluation, indicating a restriction of colorectal carcinogenesis. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis identified alterations in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, glycerophospholipids and energy in intestinal tissue. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota indicated that maternal exposure modified fecal bacterial composition. In conclusion, the results showed that early-life exposure to a mixture of POPs reduced colorectal cancer initiation and promotion, possibly through modulation of the microbial and biochemical environment. Further studies should focus on the development of colorectal cancer after combined maternal and dietary exposures to environmentally relevant low-dose POP mixtures. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI Decanoic Acid and Not Octanoic Acid Stimulates Fatty Acid Synthesis in
   U87MG Glioblastoma Cells: A Metabolomics Study
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are dietary components with a chain length ranging from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. MCFA can cross the blood-brain barrier and in the brain can be oxidized through mitochondrial beta-oxidation. As components of ketogenic diets, MCFA have demonstrated beneficial effects on different brain diseases, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, drug-resistant epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer. Despite the interest in MCFA effects, not much information is available about MCFA metabolism in the brain. In this study, with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach, coupled with multivariate data analyses, we followed the metabolic changes of U87MG glioblastoma cells after the addition of octanoic (C8), or decanoic (C10) acids for 24 h. Our analysis highlighted significant differences in the metabolism of U87MG cells after the addition of C8 or C10 and identified several metabolites whose amount changed between the two groups of treated cells. Overall, metabolic pathway analyses suggested the citric acid cycle, Warburg effect, glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and ketone body metabolism as pathways influenced by C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells. Our data demonstrated that, while C8 affected mitochondrial metabolism resulting in increased ketone body production, C10 mainly influenced cytosolic pathways by stimulating fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, glutamine might be the main substrate to support fatty acids synthesis in C10-treated cells. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic signature associated with C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells that can be used to decipher metabolic responses of glioblastoma cells to MCFA treatment.

TI Nexus between perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) and human thyroid
   dysfunction: A systematic review evidenced from laboratory
   investigations and epidemiological studies
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) have attracted massive attention in recent years for their endocrine-disrupting potential. This review summarizes the underlying evidence on the primary fate andin vitro/vivotoxic effects of PFCs and their interactions and relationships with thyroid dysfunction and cancer induction in exposed groups, including the general population, occupationally exposed groups, highly exposed individuals, and prone subjects (pregnant women and neonates). The potential endocrine-disrupting mechanism of PFCs may include multiple processes of thyroid malfunction or hormonal imbalance. The increased level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed as the most consistent outcome of PFC exposure among generally exposed populations. Specifically, the levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and TSH were significantly correlated among pregnant women. In some instances, the maternal PFC level was negatively correlated with the neonatal thyroxine (T4) level in serum. The PFCs and thyroid malfunction or thyroid hormone (TH) levels also revealed a potential association among the population under high-level environmental exposure, albeit not always following a strict exposure-response relationship. Moreover, occupational exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed a probable link with TH (excluding TSH) alterations in serum. Importantly, no concrete and statistically significant evidence highlighted the risk of thyroid cancer in humans exposed to PFCs.

TI A Critical Review on the Ubiquitous Role of Filamentous Fungi in
   Pollution Mitigation
SO CURRENT POLLUTION REPORTS
AB Propose of Review Anthropogenic activities are saturating wastewater treatment plants and the environment with an increasing range of organic and inorganic compounds, impairing ecosystems and health. Filamentous fungi, with characteristic filamentous growth, array of extracellular and intracellular enzymes, production of surfactants, cell wall biosorption properties, and symbiotic momentum, can contribute to a paradigm shift on the perception of anthropogenic pollution. This review provides a critical analysis of the main bottlenecks for feasible filamentous fungus-including processes and proposes a holistic approach for pollution mitigation using filamentous fungi. Recent Findings Filamentous fungi can convert ordinary sidestreams into, e.g., feed proteins and biofuels. Economic and environmental studies support integration in established processes. Intersectoral initiatives, and economic and environmental studies, need to be motivated to increase the range of processes. Although massively studied, the transfer of fungal processes for the removal of micropollutants into real matrices is difficult. It needs to be supported by omics technologies for the study of microbial networks, and by efficient analytical techniques to clarify detoxification potential. The area can benefit from knowledge integration from fungal growth in ordinary sidestreams, and from economic and environmental studies. The interest in filamentous fungi for pollution mitigation is corroborated by an overwhelming amount of research; however, no full-scale applications are currently known. Environmental pollution is a reality and production of ordinary sidestreams and micropollutant-rich wastewaters continuous. The establishment of filamentous fungal processes needs collaboration among governmental authorities, industries, and academics in order to tackle knowledge gaps within the area and propose a holistic approach.

TI Emerging pollutants (EPs) in Latin America: A critical review of under-
   studied EPs, case of study -Nonylphenol
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Emerging contaminants (EPs) represent a significant risk to human, ecological and environmental health. Although progress has been made in establishing monitoring in environmental matrices, health effects, legislation and control, there are still problems associated with regional bias and the types of EPs commonly assessed, which may underestimate the risk to health. In Latin America there are limited reports on environmental monitoring of EPs and it is generally focused on wastewater. This review identifies the current research deficiencies for emerging contaminants in the Latin American region, and we address the case of nonylphenol as an under-studied EP in the region. Nonylphenol is a degradation product of nonylphenol ethoxylate, which is a surfactant widely used in the manufacture of detergents in Latin America, environmental concentrations have been reported, predominantly in water, and the possible effects on species in this region have been also described. The importance of the review of this compound in the region lies in the fact that the Rotterdam Convention has catalogued nonylphenol as a severely restricted compound, so it is necessary to establish measures for its restriction and change to a sustainable technology.
   Finally, the example of NP presented in this review highlights the lack of regulation in Latin America regarding to EPs, resulting in the contamination of wastewater, effluents, rivers and drinking water. It is imperative to determine the potential effects, occurrence and concentration levels to improve the regulation of these pollutants in a timely manner.

TI Adsorption, degradation, and mineralization of emerging pollutants
   (pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals) by nanostructures: a comprehensive
   review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB This review discusses a fresh pool of research findings reported on the multiple roles played by metal-based, magnetic, graphene-type, chitosan-derived, and sonicated nanoparticles in the treatment of pharmaceutical- and agrochemical-contaminated waters. Some main points from this review are as follows: (i) there is an extensive number of nanoparticles with diverse physicochemical and morphological properties which have been synthesized and then assessed in their respective roles in the degradation and mineralization of many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, (ii) the exceptional removal efficiencies of graphene-based nanomaterials for different pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals molecules support arguably well a high potential of these nanomaterials for futuristic applications in remediating water pollution issues, (iii) the need for specific surface modifications and functionalization of parent nanostructures and the design of economically feasible production methods of such tunable nanomaterials tend to hinder their widespread applicability at this stage, (iv) supplementary research is also required to comprehensively elucidate the life cycle ecotoxicity characteristics and behaviors of each type of engineered nanostructures seeded for remediation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals in real contaminated media, and last but not the least, (v) real wastewaters are extremely complex in composition due to the mix of inorganic and organic species in different concentrations, and the presence of such mixed species have different radical scavenging effects on the sonocatalytic degradation and mineralization of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Moreover, the formulation of viable full-scale implementation strategies and reactor configurations which can use multifunctional nanostructures for the effective remediation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals remains a major area of further research.

TI Application of a fluorous derivatization method for characterization of
   glutathione-trapped reactive metabolites with liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB The glutathione (GSH) trapping assay is commonly utilized for the screening and characterization of reactive metabolites produced by drug metabolism. This study describes a fluorous derivatization method for a more sensitive and selective analysis of reactive metabolites trapped by GSH using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In this study, the GSH-trapped reactive metabolites, which were obtained after incubation of the test compounds with human liver microsome (HLM) in the presence of GSH and NADPH, were derivatized using the perfluoroalkylamine reagent through oxazolone chemistry. Since this reaction enabled the selective modification of the cz-carboxyl group in GSH, the structural compositions of the metabolites were not affected by the derivatization. Furthermore, the selective analysis of the resulting derivatives could be performed using perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC separation via the interaction between the perfluoroalkyl-containing compounds, such as fluorous affinity, followed by detection with the precursor ion and/or enhanced product ion scan modes in MS/MS. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of this method by analyzing perfluoroalkyl derivatives of some drug metabolites trapped by GSH in HLM incubation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI Adsorptive removal of trace thallium(I) from wastewater: A review and
   new perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Thallium is an emerging pollutant reported in wastewater along with the increasing mining and smelling of thallium-containing ores in recent years. The complete removal of Tl(I) from wastewater is of significant emergency due to its high toxicity and mobility, however, Tl(I) removal is always confronted with numerous technical difficulties because of the extremely low Tl(I) concentration in wastewater and the disturbances of many accompanying impurity ions. Adsorption is currently the most widely used method for Tl(I) removal on industrial scale and varied kinds of adsorbents such as Prussian blue analogues, biosorbents, and metal oxides have been developed. However, the adsorption process of Tl(I) is always affected by the co-existing cations, resulting in low Tl(I) removal efficiency. Recently, the development of a variety of novel adsorbents or ion sensors based on macrocyclic compounds for enrichment and accurate determination of trace Tl(I) in aqueous solutions exhibits great potential for application in Tl(I) removal from wastewater with high selectivity and process efficiency. This paper provides an overview of the adsorption methods for Tl(I) removal from wastewater with emphasis on complexation properties between varied types of adsorbents and Tl(I). Future directions of research and development of adsorptive Tl(I) removal from industrial wastewater are proposed.

TI Recent Developments of PFAS-Detecting Sensors and Future Direction: A
   Review
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have recently been labeled as toxic constituents that exist in many aqueous environments. However, traditional methods used to determine the level of PFASs are often not appropriate for continuous environmental monitoring and management. Based on the current state of research, PFAS-detecting sensors have surfaced as a promising method of determination. These sensors are an innovative solution with characteristics that allow for in situ, low-cost, and easy-to-use capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent developments in PFAS-detecting sensors, and why the literature on determination methods has shifted in this direction compared to the traditional methods used. PFAS-detecting sensors discussed herein are primarily categorized in terms of the detection mechanism used. The topics covered also include the current limitations, as well as insight on the future direction of PFAS analyses. This paper is expected to be useful for the smart sensing technology development of PFAS detection methods and the associated environmental management best practices in smart cities of the future.

TI Intestinal environmental disorders associate with the tissue damages
   induced by perfluorooctane sulfonate exposure
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a recently identified and persistent organic pollutant that becomes enriched in living organisms via bioaccumulation and the food chain. PFOS can induce various disorders, including liver toxicity, neurotoxicity and metabolic dysregulation. Most recent studies have shown a close association of the gut microbiota with the occurrence of diseases. However, few studies have explored the effects of PFOS on the gut environment, including the intestinal flora and barrier. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PFOS in C57BL/6J male mice and explored the relationship between tissue damage and the gut environment. Mice were orally exposed to PFOS for 16 days. Liver damage was assessed by examining the inflammatory reaction in the liver and serum liver enzyme concentrations. Metabolic function was assessed by the hepatic cholesterol level and the serum concentrations of glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Intestinal environmental disorders were assessed by evaluating the gut microbiota, SCFAs production, inflammatory reactions and intestinal tight junction protein expression. Our results indicated that PFOS affected inflammatory reactions in the liver and colon and promoted the development of metabolic disorders (especially of cholesterol and glucose metabolism). Moreover, PFOS dysregulated various populations in the gut microbiota (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridiales, Enterobacteriales, Lactobacillales, Erysipelotrichaceae, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Blautia) and induced a loss of gut barrier integrity by reducing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and intestinal tight junction protein expression. A Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis mainly identified metabolic pathways (e.g., the adipocytokine signalling pathway), endocrine system pathways (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis), the latter of which is widely considered to be associated with metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that PFOS damages various aspects of the gut environment, including the microbiota, SCFAs and barrier function, and thereby exacerbates the toxicity associated with liver, gut and metabolic disorders.

   Stability
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Pharmacological activation of NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) arises from blocking the interaction of NRF2 with its negative regulator, KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1). We previously reported an isoquinoline-based NRF2 activator, but this compound showed negative logD(7.4) and a -2 charge at physiological pH, which may have limited its membrane permeability. In this work, we report potent, metabolically stable analogs that result from replacing a carboxymethyl group at the 4-position with a fluoroalkyl group.

TI Mesh-related complications in paraoesophageal repair: a systematic
   review
SO SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB Background Paraoesophageal hernias (PEH) have a high recurrence rate, prompting surgeons to consider the use of mesh reinforcement of the hiatus. The risks and benefits of mesh augmentation in PEH repair are debated. Mesh-related complications including migration and erosion are considered in this publication. Design A systematic literature review of articles published between 1970 and 2019 in Medline, OVID, Embase, and Springer database was conducted, identifying case reports, case series and observational studies of PEH repair reporting mesh-related complications. Results Thirty-five case reports/series of 74 patients and 20 observational studies reporting 75 of 4200 patients with mesh complications have been included. The incidence of mesh-related erosions in this study is 0.035%. PTFE, ePTFE, composite and synthetic meshes were frequently associated with mesh erosion requiring intervention. Complete erosions are often managed endoscopically while partial erosions may require surgery and resection of the oesophagus and/or stomach. Conclusions Mesh-related complication is rare with dysphagia a common presenting feature. Mesh erosion is associated with synthetic mesh more frequently in the reported literature. A mesh registry with long-term longitudinal data would help in understanding the true incidence of mesh-related complications.

TI Worldwide bottled water occurrence of emerging contaminants: A review of
   the recent scientific literature
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have recently been detected in bottled water and have brought about discussions on possible risks for human health. However, a systematic review of CECs in bottled water is currently lacking due to the relatively new introduction and/or detection of these pollutants. Hence, this paper reviews the existing studies on the presence of six major groups of emerging contaminants including microplastics (MPs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, alkylphenols (APs), and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in bottled water from different countries. Also, the findings related to CECs' levels, their possible sources, and their risks are summarized. The gathered data indicate that MPs within the size range of 1 - 5 mu m are the most predominant and potentially toxic classes of MPs in bottled water. In addition, PPCPs, PFASs, APs, and BPA occur in concentration levels of ng/L, while phthalates occur in the mu g/L level in bottled water. The bottle type plays an important role in the contamination level. As expected, water in plastic bottles with plastic caps is more polluted than in glass bottles. However, other sources of contamination such as contact materials during cleaning, bottling, and storage are not negligible. Based on the gathered data in this review, the CEC levels except for MPs (no threshold values) in bottled water of most countries do not raise a safety concern for the human. However, the occurrence of individual CECs and their association in bottled water need more accurate data to understand their own/synergistic effects on human health.

TI A Narrative and Critical Review of Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trials
   on Patent Foramen Ovale Closure for Reducing the Risk of Stroke
   Recurrence
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common cardiac anatomic variant that has been increasingly found in young (<60 years) cryptogenic stroke patients. Despite initial neutral randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs), there have been four recent RCTs providing consistent data in favor of the efficacy and safety of PFO closure compared to medical therapy for secondary stroke prevention. However, taking into consideration the high prevalence of PFO, the low risk of stroke recurrence under medical treatment and the uncommon yet severe adverse events of the intervention, patient selection is crucial for attaining meaningful clinical benefits. Thorough workup to exclude alternative causes of stroke and identification of high-risk PFOs through clinical, neuroimaging and echocardiographic criteria are essential. Cost effectiveness of the procedure cannot be proven for the time being, since there are no robust data on clinical outcome after PFO-associated stroke but only limited anecdotal data suggesting low risk for long-term disability.

TI Synthesis and Gas Transport Properties of Addition Polynorbornene with
   Perfluorophenyl Side Groups
SO POLYMERS
AB Polynorbornenes represent a fruitful class of polymers for structure-property study. Recently, vinyl-addition polynorbornenes bearing side groups of different natures were observed to exhibit excellent gas permeation ability, along with attractive C4H10/CH(4)and CO2/N(2)separation selectivities. However, to date, the gas transport properties of fluorinated addition polynorbornenes have not been reported. Herein, we synthesized addition polynorbornene with fluoroorganic substituents and executed a study on the gas transport properties of the polymer for the first time. A norbornene-type monomer with a C(6)F(5)group, 3-pentafluorophenyl-exo-tricyclononene-7, was successfully involved in addition polymerization, resulting in soluble, high-molecular-weight products obtained in good or high yields. By varying the monomer concentration and monomer/catalyst ratio, it was possible to reach M(w)values of (2.93-4.35) x 10(5). The molecular structure was confirmed by NMR and FTIR analysis. The contact angle with distilled water revealed the hydrophobic nature of the synthesized polymer as expected due to the presence of fluoroorganic side groups. A study of the permeability of various gases (He, H-2, O-2, N-2, CO2, and CH4) through the prepared polymer disclosed a synergetic effect, which was achieved by the presence of both bulky perfluorinated side groups and rigid saturated main chains. Addition poly(3-pentafluorophenyl-exo-tricyclononene-7) was more permeable than its metathesis analogue by a factor of 7-21, or the similar polymer with flexible main chains, poly(pentafluorostyrene), in relation to the gases tested. Therefore, this investigation opens the door to fluorinated addition polynorbornenes as new potential polymeric materials for membrane gas separation.

Although evidence in children is scarce since very few prospective studies exist even in adults, evidence that EDCs might be involved in the development of insulin resistance and related diseases such as obesity and diabetes is accumulating. We reviewed the literature on both cross-sectional and prospective studies in humans and experimental studies. Epidemiological studies show a statistical link between exposure to pesticides, polychlorinated bisphenyls, bisphenol A, phthalates, aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbides, or dioxins and insulin resistance.

TI Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Neurotoxicity in Sentinel and
   Non-Traditional Laboratory Model Systems: Potential Utility in
   Predicting Adverse Outcomes in Human Health
SO TOXICS
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemicals that were widely used in manufacturing and are now present in the environment throughout the world. It is known that various PFAS are quantifiable in human in blood, but potential adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Sentinel and non-traditional model species are useful to study potential toxicity of PFAS in order to understand the relationship between environmental and human health. Here, we present a critical review of studies on the neurotoxicity of PFAS in sentinel and non-traditional laboratory model systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans(nematode),Dugesia japonica(planarian),Rana pipiens(frogs),Danio rerioand Oryzias melastigma(fish), and Ursus maritimus(polar bears). PFAS have been implicated in developmental neurotoxicity in non-traditional and traditional model systems as well as sentinel species, including effects on neurotransmitter levels, especially acetylcholine and its metabolism. However, further research on the mechanisms of toxicity needs to be conducted to determine if these chemicals are affecting organisms in a similar manner. Overall, findings tend to be similar among the various species, but bioaccumulation may vary, which needs to be taken into account in future studies by quantifying target organ concentrations of PFAS to better compare different species. Furthermore, data on the majority of PFAS is lacking in neurotoxicity testing, and additional studies are needed to corroborate findings thus far.

TI Impact of enhanced recovery after surgery or fast track surgery pathways
   in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and
   meta-analysis
SO TRANSLATIONAL ANDROLOGY AND UROLOGY
AB Background: The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and fast track surgery (FTS) protocols have been applied to a variety of surgeries and have been proven to reduce complications, accelerate rehabilitation, and reduce medical costs. However, the effectiveness of these protocols in minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (miRP) is still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of ERAS and FTS protocols in miRP. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases to collect randomized and observational studies comparing ERAS/FTS versus conventional care in miRP up to July 1, 2019. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment by two independent reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In total, 11 studies involving 1,207 patients were included. Pooled data showed that ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) (WMD:-2.41 days, 95% CI:-4.00 to -0.82 days, P=0.003), time to first anus exhaust (WMD:-0.74 days, 95% CI:-1.14 to-0.34 days, P=0.0003), and lower incidence of postoperative complications (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.92, P=0.01). No significant differences were found between groups for operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative pain, blood transfusion rate, and readmission rate (P 0.01). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that the ERAS/FTS protocol is safe and effective in miRP. However, more extensive, long-term, prospective, multicenter follow-up studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to validate our findings.

TI The effects of postnatal exposure of endocrine disruptors on testicular
   function: a systematic review and a meta-analysis
SO HORMONES-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM
AB Background Despite many epidemiological studies having been conducted, the impact of postnatal exposure of endocrine disruptors (EDs) on testicular function remains a controversial issue. Aim To systematically review the literature and perform a quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effect of EDs on testicular function. Materials and methods A comprehensive search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases. Eligible for the systematic review were observational (cross-sectional and cohort) studies with (i) adult men who had a high probability of postnatal exposure to EDs ("exposed"), (ii) adult men who had a low probability of postnatal exposure to EDs ("non-exposed"), and (iii) an outcome of interest [seminal parameters and reproductive hormone concentrations]. The continuous outcomes in each of the studies were synthesized by the random effects model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Thirteen studies, including 959 exposed and 907 non-exposed men, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Exposure to EDs was associated with decreased LH [SMD - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.33 to - 0.02, 10 studies (616 exposed, 563 non-exposed), I-2 40%, p = 0.09], progressive motility [SMD - 0.45, 95% CI - 0.77 to - 0.13, three studies (133 cases, 153 controls), I-2 38%, p = 0.20], and normal morphology [SMD - 0.50, 95% CI - 0.85 to - 0.14, eight studies (562 cases, 540 controls), I-2 87%, p < 0.01] compared with non-exposure. No difference was observed between the other study groups. Conclusions Postnatal exposure to EDs is associated with decreased semen quality. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that a disruption of testicular function mediates the deterioration in semen quality.

TI Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and anthropometric measures
   of obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Objective Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are viewed as a major potential link between the environment and obesity development. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity.
   Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias.
   Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements.
   Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184).
   Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

TI Prenatal Diagnosis of Glutaric Acidemia I Based on Amniotic Fluid
   Samples in 42 Families Using Genetic and Biochemical Approaches
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Direct mutation analysis is the major method for glutaric acidemia I (GA-I) prenatal diagnosis, while systemic application of a biochemical strategy is rare. We describe our experiences with metabolite measurement together with mutation analysis in GA-I prenatal diagnosis at a single center over 10 years. The data of genetic analysis and metabolite measurement using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry(GC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) in amniotic fluid samples of 44 fetuses from 42 GA-I families referred to our center from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Among these 44 fetuses, genetic and biochemical results were both available in 39 fetuses. Of these, 6 fetuses were judged as affected and 33 fetuses as unaffected by mutation analysis. The levels of glutarylcarnitine (C5DC), C5DC/octanoylcarnitine (C8), and glutaric acid in the supernatant of amniotic fluid from affected fetuses were significantly higher than those in unaffected fetuses [1.73 mu mol/L (0.89-4.19) vs. 0.16 mu mol/L (0.06-0.37), 26.26 (12.4-55.55) vs. 2.23 (1.04-8.44), and 103.94 mmol/mol creatinine (30.37-148.31) vs. 1.01mmol/mol creatinine (0-9.81), respectively; all P < 0.0001]. Among all families, two were found to have one causative mutation in the proband, in four pregnancies from these two families, three fetuses were judged as "unaffected" and one was judged as "affected" according to metabolites results. Postnatal follow-up showed a normal phenotype in all unaffected fetuses judged by mutation or metabolite analysis. C5DC, C5DC/C8, and glutaric acid levels in the supernatant of amniotic fluid showed significant differences and no overlap between the affected and unaffected fetuses. Biochemical strategy could be implemented as a quick and convenient method for the prenatal diagnosis of GA-I.

TI Metabolomic profiles of the endangered St. Lawrence Estuary beluga
   population and associations with organohalogen contaminants
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The endangered beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population residing in the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE; Eastern Canada) is declining. The elevated tissue concentrations of a wide range of organohalogen contaminants might play a role in the non-recovery of this whale population. Organohalogens have been reported to impair the regulation of several metabolic products from cellular reactions in mammals such as amino acids and fatty adds. The objective of this study was to investigate a suite of organohalogens including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and selected emerging flame retardants in blubber (biopsy) collected from 40 SLE male belugas, and their relationships to skin concentrations of targeted metabolites (i.e., 21 amino acids, 22 biogenic amines, 18 fatly acids, and 17 energy metabolites). A cluster analysis based on metabolomic profiles distinguished two main subgroups of belugas in the upper and lower sector of their summer habitat in the SLE. These results indicate that ecological factors such as local prey availability and diet composition played a role in shaping the metabolite profiles of belugas. Moreover. SCCP concentrations in SLE male belugas correlated negatively with those of four unsaturated fatty adds (C16:1 omega 7, C22:5 omega 3c1, C22:5 omega 3c2, and C22:6 omega 3), and positively with those of acetylornithine (biogenic amine). These findings suggest that biological functions such as lipid metabolism represent potential targets for organohalogens in this population, and further our understanding on potential health risks associated with elevated organohalogen exposure in cetaceans. Our results also underscore the necessity of considering ecological factors (e.g., diet and habitat use) in metabolomic studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Waste materials for wastewater treatment and waste adsorbents for
   biofuel and cement supplement applications: A critical review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A pragmatic shift is ongoing in waste material management and wastewater treatment technology due to the large amount of waste production worldwide and the necessity for cheap adsorbents to reduce wastewater treatment costs. Improvements in the circular economy and energy recovery from waste materials is another fast-growing concept for promoting sustainability and a greener environment. This review study endeavours to integrate the concept of wastewater treatment by waste materials (agricultural residue, industrial and municipal waste, organic and inorganic sources) and utilization of the used waste adsorbents for value-added products through further treatment. Although very few experimental studies were performed on this concept, this study summarizes the potential valuable products such as regenerated adsorbents, biofuel, soil amendment supplements and cementitious material by utilizing waste adsorbent. Production mechanisms of valuable products is discussed comprehensively. This review also documents the major emerging contaminants, the diverse waste materials as potential adsorbent candidates and conversion processes from waste into adsorbents. The outcome of this review promotes the utilization of waste into multiple useful products generation which may improve waste management and boost the circular economy. The integrated applications of this review describe the commercial window available to accumulate waste materials for large scale applications. Further, sources of energy and nutrients extracted from waste materials after treating polluted water in industries, municipal units and animal husbandries can be a significant contributor to commercial viability in the future.

TI Molecular Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Contrast Agents for Assessment
   of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review
SO CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB Background and Aims. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has taken an important role in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In the wake of current advances in nanotechnology, the drug delivery industry has seen a surge of nanoparticles advertising high specificity in target imaging. Given the rapid development of the field, this review has assembled related articles to explore whether molecular contrast agents can improve the diagnostic capability on gastrointestinal imaging, especially for IBD. Methods. Relevant articles published between 1998 and 2018 from a literature search of PubMed and EMBASE were reviewed. Data extraction was performed on the studies' characteristics, experimental animals, modelling methods, nanoparticles type, magnetic resonance methods, and means of quantitative analysis. Results. A total of 8 studies were identified wherein the subjects were animals, and all studies employed MR equipment. One group utilized a perfluorocarbon solution and the other 7 groups used either magnetic nanoparticles or gadolinium- (Gd-) related nanoparticles for molecular contrast. With ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles and Gd-related nanoparticles, signal enhancements were found in the mucosa or with focal lesion of IBD-related model in T1-weighted images (T1WI), whereas superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles showed a signal decrease in the intestinal wall of the model in T1WI or T2-weighted images. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was employed to analyze bowel intensity in 3 studies. And the percentage of normalized enhancement was used in 1 study for assessing the severity of inflammation. Conclusion. Molecular MRI with contrast agents can improve the early diagnosis of IBD and quantitate the severity of inflammation in experimental studies.

TI Early Life Exposure to Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and ADHD: A
   Meta-Analysis of Nine European Population-Based Studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB INTRODUCTION: To date, the evidence for an association between perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is inconclusive.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between early life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and ADHD in a collaborative study including nine European population-based studies, encompassing 4,826 mother-child pairs.
   METHODS: Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal serum/plasma during pregnancy, or in breast milk, with different timing of sample collection in each cohort. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model of pregnancy and lactation to estimate concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children at birth and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. We classified ADHD using recommended cutoff points for each instrument used to derive symptoms scores. We used multiple imputation for missing covariates, logistic regression to model the association between PFAS exposure and ADHD in each study, and combined all adjusted study-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 399 children were classified as having ADHD, with a prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 7.3% in the studies. Early life exposure to PFOS or PFOA was not associated with ADHD during childhood [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.06) to 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.11)]. Results from stratified models suggest potential differential effects of PFAS related to child sex and maternal education.
   CONCLUSION: We did not identify an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with early life exposure to PFOS and PFOA. However, stratified analyses suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of ADHD in association with PFAS exposure in girls, in children from nulliparous women, and in children from low-educated mothers, all of which warrant further exploration.

TI Cobalt hybrid catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
SO REVIEWS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Currently, cobalt and zeolites are used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons (GRHs) that constitute dean and environmentally friendly fuels. This technology has earned a great deal of attention from researchers across the world, as it provides a substitute for fuel derived from fossil crudes, which have hitherto been the sole source of the petrol and diesel required by the industry. However, owing to the depletion of the earth's oil and coal reserves and the unfavourable environmental impact of conventional fuel production, an alternative source of fuel is needed. This article provides a critical review of the technological challenges involved in producing middle isoparaffins and olefins (gasoline hydrocarbons) by FTS. These involve combining cobalt-based catalysts and zeolites to form hybrid catalysts. In this review, we address most of these by setting out each method of creating cobalt and zeolite hybrid catalysts in turn, so that researchers can identify which applications are most effective for producing GRHs.

TI Occupational and dietary differences in hydroxylated and methoxylated
   PBDEs and metals in plasma from Puget Sound, Washington, USA region
   volunteers
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Electronic waste (E-waste) recycling is a rapidly growing occupation in the USA with the potential for elevated exposure to flame retardants and metals associated with electronic devices. We previously measured polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in plasma from E-waste workers and found them similar to non-E-waste workers. This study focused on structurally related PBDE derivatives, the hydroxylated (OH-PBDEs) and methoxylated (MeO-PBDEs) forms along with metals known to occur in E-waste. Humans can metabolize PBDEs and some MeO-PBDEs into OH-PBDEs, which is a concern due to greater health risks associated with OH-PBDEs. We measured 32 different OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs in plasma samples provided by 113 volunteers living in the greater Puget Sound region of Washington State, USA. We measured 14 metals in a subset of 10 E-waste and 10 non-E-waste volunteers. Volunteers were selected based on occupational and dietary habits: work outdoors and consume above average amounts of seafood (outdoor), electronic waste recycling (E-waste) or non-specific indoor occupations (indoor). A two-week food consumption diary was obtained from each volunteer prior to blood sampling. OH-PBDEs were detected in all volunteers varying between 0.27 and 102 ng/g/g-lipid. The MeO-PBDEs were detected in most, but not all volunteers varying between n.d. 60.4 ng/g/g-lipid. E-waste recyclers had OH-PBDE and MeO-PBDE plasma levels that were similar to the indoor group. The outdoor group had significantly higher levels of MeO-PBDEs, but not OH-PBDEs. Comparison of plasma concentrations of BDE-47 with its known hydroxylated metabolites suggested OH-PBDE levels were likely determined by biotransformation and at least two subpopulations identified differing in their apparent rates of OH-PBDE formation.

TI Interpretive search of optimal isocratic and gradient separations in
   micellar liquid chromatography in extended organic solvent domains
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB Micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) is a reversed-phase mode with mobile phases containing an organic solvent and a micellised surfactant. Most procedures developed in MLC are implemented in the isocratic mode, since the general elution problem in chromatography is less troublesome. However, gradient elution may be still useful in MLC to analyse mixtures of compounds within a wide range of polarities, in shorter times. MLC using gradients is attractive to determine by direct injection moderate to low polar compounds in physiological samples. In these analyses, the use of initial micellar conditions (isocratic or gradient) with a fixed amount of surfactant above the critical micellar concentration, keeping the organic solvent content low, will provide better protection of the column against the precipitation of the proteins in the physiological fluid. Once the proteins are swept away, the elution strength can be increased using a positive gradient of organic solvent to reduce the analysis time. This may give rise to the transition from the micellar to the submicellar mode, since micelles are destroyed at sufficiently high concentration of organic solvent. In this work, several retention models covering extended solvent domains in MLC are developed and tested, and applied to investigate the performance in isocratic, linear and multi-linear gradient separations. The study was applied to the screening of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in urine samples, using mobile phases prepared with sodium dodecyl sulphate and 1-propanol. Predicted chromatograms were highly accurate in all situations, although suffered of baseline problems and minor shifts for peaks eluting close to a steep gradient segment. Two columns (C18 and C8) were investigated, with the C8 column being preferable owing to the smaller amount of adsorbed surfactant. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Destruction of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) with Advanced
   Reduction Processes (ARPs): A Critical Review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Advanced reduction processes (ARPs) have emerged as a promising method for destruction of persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water due to the generation of short-lived and highly reductive hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)). This study provides a critical review on the mechanisms and performance of reductive destruction of PFAS with e(aq)(-). Unique properties of e(aq)(-) and its generation in different ARP systems, particularly UV/sulfite and UV/iodide, are overviewed. Different degradation mechanisms of PFAS chemicals, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and others (e.g., short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), per- and polyfluoro dicarboxylic acids, and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids), are reviewed, discussed, and compared. The degradation pathways of these PFAS chemicals rely heavily upon their head groups. For specific PFAS types, fluoroalkyl chain lengths may also affect their reductive degradation patterns. Degradation and defluorination efficiencies of PFAS are considerably influenced by solution chemistry parameters and operating factors, such as pH, dose of chemical solute (i.e., sulfite or iodide) for e(aq)(-) photoproduction, dissolved oxygen, humic acid, nitrate, and temperature. Furthermore, implications of the state-of-the-art knowledge on practical PFAS control actions in water industries are discussed and the priority research needs are identified.

TI Unregulated and Emerging Contaminants in Tribal Water
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION
AB Emerging contaminants in Tribal water have been unexplored until implementation of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) campaigns, which mandated the analysis of up to 30 new contaminants in drinking water every five years. As additions to the Safe Water Drinking Act (SDWA), the UCMR1 - 3 were created to assess contaminants which have not yet been assigned a maximum contaminant level (MCL) but may be regulated in the future to protect human health. While a handful of Tribes (n = 6) participated in UCMR1, public water systems (PWS) within reservation boundaries were intentionally included in representative nation-wide sampling beginning with UCMR2 after a period of Tribal consultation. Still, less than 3% of Tribal PWS were surveyed. The results from UCMR2 revealed that samples from all surveyed Tribal PWS fell below the method detection limits. Target analytes shifted to metals, perfluorinated chemicals, hormones, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dioxane, and chlorate under UCMR3. Detectable levels of metals (chromium, hexavalent chromium, strontium, and vanadium), chlorate, and dioxane were observed, and in some cases, at concentrations greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) recommended health reference limit (HRL). The presence of elevated levels of vanadium, strontium, 1,4-dioxane, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and chlorate defines a new set of emerging contaminants that needs to be considered with regards to risk, reporting and monitoring, and water treatment in Tribal drinking water.

TI Artifacts in macular optical coherence tomography
SO JOURNAL OF CURRENT OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose: To identify and explain different artifacts in macular optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: For this comprehensive review, a PubMed and Google Scholar (January 1995-October 2018) search was conducted by the researchers, using the keywords such as OCT, artifacts, artefact, and macula. Results: We reviewed the main OCT artifacts including software break-down or misidentification of retinal layers, incomplete segmentation error, complete segmentation failure, mirror artifact (inverted artifact), cut edge artifact, degraded image scan, out-of-register artifact, off-center artifact, motion artifact, foveal duplication, segmentation shift, blink artifact, static or fixed image artifact, linear artifact, and perfluorocarbon liquid-producing artifact. Conclusions: There are various artifacts in OCT image scans. The identification of these artifacts may help in accurate interpretations of OCT images in clinical settings that can affect the diagnosis and management of different retinal disorders.

TI Transcriptome-guided parsimonious flux analysis improves predictions
   with metabolic networks in complex environments
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cell's investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to in vivo metatranscriptomic data where E. coli was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.
   Author summary
   Transcriptomic analyses of bacteria have become instrumental to our understanding of their responses to changes in their environment. While traditional analyses have been informative, leveraging these datasets within genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) can provide greatly improved context for shifts in pathway utilization and downstream/upstream ramifications for changes in metabolic regulation. Many previous techniques for GENRE transcript integration have focused on creating maximum consensus with input datasets, but these approaches were recently shown to generate less accurate metabolic predictions than a transcript-agnostic method of flux minimization (pFBA), which identifies the most efficient/economic patterns of metabolism given certain growth constraints. Despite this success, growth conditions are not always easily quantifiable and highlights the need for novel platforms that build from these findings. Our new method, RIPTiDe, combines these concepts and utilizes overall minimization of flux weighted by transcriptomic analysis to identify the most energy efficient pathways to achieve growth that include more highly transcribed enzymes, without previous insight into extracellular conditions. Utilizing a well-studied GENRE from Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that this new approach correctly predicts patterns of metabolism utilizing a variety of both in vitro and in vivo transcriptomes. This platform could be important for revealing context-specific bacterial phenotypes in line with governing principles of adaptive evolution, that drive disease manifestation or interactions between microbes.

TI Physiotherapy and Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises for the Prevention and
   Treatment of Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions: A Systematic
   Review and Meta-analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION SCIENCES
AB Objectives: The present systematic review focused on the prevention or treatment of three main types of pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) specifically pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary incontinence (UI), and fecal incontinence (FI) using physiotherapy and pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFMEs). With regard to the breadth of the problem, there is not much evidence grounded on the best management. The main purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy and PFMEs on the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related PFDs; namely, POP, FI, and UI. Therefore, this review incorporated studies comparing the use of physiotherapy and PFMEs with every other existing interventions.
   Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on randomized-controlled-trial (RCT) articles and quasi-RCT designs through a search in the studies published with no time limits until December 2017 in the databases of PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. The meta-analysis was also applied for data synthesis. Moreover, heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I-2 index.
   Results: A total number of 26 RCTs were examined in this review in which the outcome variables were related to POP, UI, and FI prevalence; POP, UI, and FI severity, as well as pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength and endurance. In most articles, UI prevalence or severity in intervention groups had significantly improved compared with those in controls. The number of studies examining POP and FI was also relatively low. In two studies, FI severity or prevalence in intervention groups had significantly enhanced in comparison with those in control groups; however, FI prevalence in two articles had been reported lower in intervention groups than that in control groups although no significant difference had been observed. There was also no significant improvement in intervention groups in two other studies in this respect. Besides, three articles had not reported traces of improvement in POP, as well as a significant difference between intervention and control groups. Nevertheless, two studies had found a significant improvement in POP in this regard. Based on meta-analysis results for the variable of PFM strength, Cochran's Q test (P < 0.001) and I2 index (90.02) indicated heterogeneity between studies; so, a random-effect meta-analysis was applied to estimate overall effect sizes. The overall mean differences following intervention between the study groups were also equal to 6.94, with a 95% CI (1.36 to 12.52).
   Conclusions: It was concluded that physiotherapy and PFMEs might have effects on pregnancy-related UI, but they had not consistently reduced FI severity or prevalence and failed to constantly improve POP.

TI A Neural basis for Octanoic acid regulation of energy balance
SO MOLECULAR METABOLISM
AB Objectives: Nutrient sensing by hypothalamic neurons is critical for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. We aimed to identify long- and medium-chain fatty acid species transported into the brain, their effects on energy balance, and the mechanisms by which they regulate activity of hypothalamic neurons.
   Methods: Simultaneous blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling was undertaken in rats and metabolic analyses using radiolabeled fatty acid tracers were performed on mice. Electrophysiological recording techniques were used to investigate signaling mechanisms underlying fatty acid-induced changes in activity of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons.
   Results: Medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) octanoic acid (C8:0), unlike long-chain fatty acids, was rapidly transported into the hypothalamus of mice and almost exclusively oxidized, causing rapid, transient reductions in food intake and increased energy expenditure. Octanoic acid differentially regulates the excitability of POMC neurons, activating these neurons directly via GPR40 and inducing inhibition via an indirect non-synaptic, purine, and adenosine receptor-dependent mechanism.
   Conclusions: MCFA octanoic acid is a central signaling nutrient that targets POMC neurons via distinct direct and indirect signal transduction pathways to instigate changes in energy status. These results could explain the beneficial health effects that accompany MCFA consumption. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The ecotoxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is complex and has been reported in animals (including fish and mice), but the effects of PFOS in plants. especially the toxic mechanisms, have rarely been studied. High-throughput nontargeted metabolomics methods for comprehensive assessment were selected to study changes in metabolic characteristics in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by exposure to different concentrations of PFOS throughout the growth period (30 days). All the metabolites were analyzed by PCA and OPLS-DA methods, by the cutoff of VIP and p-value, 53 biomarkers were found and significantly regulated, all amino acids except glutamate were inhibited and probably associated with binding to protein, auxin and cytokinin of phytohormones were significantly down-regulated. In response mechanism to oxidative stress from Pros, the phenylpropanoid pathway were fully activated to form several polyphenols and further enhanced into several flavonoids against the reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary defend pathway, in addition, ascorbate, trehalose and nicotinamide also were activated and help decrease the damage from oxidative stress. These results provide insights into the mechanism underlying the phytotoxicity of PFOS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Macular optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal
   surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB The primary aim of this study was to summarize and illustrate the main structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings encountered after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This was a non-systematic review of literature on structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Adequate illustrations of the main findings described were found after a retrospective analysis of imaging and charts of patients operated at the department where this study was performed. The main structural cross-sectional optical coherence tomography findings after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment included persistent subretinal fluid, subretinal blebs, retinal folds, subretinal perfluorocarbon liquids, macular alterations related to silicone oil, epiretinal membranes, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, cystoid macular edema, macular holes, and recurrent retinal detachment. In conclusion, optical coherence tomography was a useful tool after vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Some optical coherence tomography findings may not be evident on fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography can reveal essential details for the clinical management and the visual prognosis. Other findings, despite being visible on funduscopic examination, may be better assessed with the aid of optical coherence tomography. All these elements contribute to support the importance of tomographic assessment in the follow-up of eyes treated for vitreoretinal conditions.

TI Removal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water by
   adsorption: Role of PFAS chain length, effect of organic matter and
   challenges in adsorbent regeneration
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a wide group of environmentally persistent organic compounds of industrial origin, which are of great concern due to their harmful impact on human health and ecosystems. Amongst long-chain PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are the most detected in the aquatic environment, even though their use has been limited by recent regulations. Recently, more attention has been posed on the short-chain compounds, due to their use as an alternative to long-chain ones, and to their high mobility in the water bodies. Therefore, short-chain PFAS have been increasingly detected in the environmental compartments. The main process investigated and implemented for PFAS removal is adsorption. However, to date, most adsorption studies have focused on synthetic water.
   The main objective of this article is to provide a critical review of the recent peer-reviewed studies on the removal of long- and short-chain PFAS by adsorption. Specific objectives are to review 1) the performance of different adsorbents for both long- and short-chain PFAS, 2) the effect of organic matter, and 3) the adsorbent regeneration techniques. Strong anion-exchange resins seem to better remove both long- and short-chain PFAS. However, the adsorption capacity of short-chain PFAS is lower than that observed for long-chain PFAS. Therefore, short-chain PFAS removal is more challenging. Furthermore, the effect of organic matter on PFAS adsorption in water or wastewater under real environmental conditions is overlooked. In most studies high PFAS levels have been often investigated without organic matter presence. The rapid breakthrough of PFAS is also a limiting factor and the regeneration of PFAS exhausted adsorbents is very challenging and needs more research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Treatment train approaches for the remediation of per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A critical review
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have recently drawn great attention due to their ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments and potential toxicity to human health and the environment. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that "passive" removal approaches, such as adsorption, filtration, and reverse osmosis or "active" degradation technologies, such as enhanced photolysis, electrochemical oxidation, and sonochemical destruction, are all able to individually conduct remedial measures for PFAS contamination at some level. However, drawbacks, specifically high energy consumption, low cost-efficiency, and extreme operating conditions, are commonly observed from these studies which significantly suppress the future for commercialization of these innovative technologies. Since 2015, a new trend of PFAS remediation has emerged that uses multiple synergetic technologies simultaneously (known as treatment train processes) to effectively achieve in-situ remediation of PFAS. This paper provides new insight of the recently reported treatment train studies selected from approximately 150 different publications with regards to the remediation of PFAS and discusses their innovative designs, remediation performances, present limits, and possible improvements. Based on a comprehensive review of the current treatment train studies, this review work proposes a new design that consists of three individual technologies, namely, nanofiltration, electrochemical anodic oxidation, and electro-Fenton degradation, to maximize economic and environmental benefits of PFAS remedial measures.

AB Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) is one of the most widely used organophosphate ester flame retardants. The presence of TDCPP in surface waters and aquatic organisms have been reported worldwide, yet the ecological risk of TDCPP on microalgae is rarely studied. We investigated the biotransformation of TDCPP and its toxicity on the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Exposure to TDCPP resulted in a dose-response decrease of micoalgal biomass. In the presence of microalgae, TDCPP concentration in the media decreased by 25.3-40.6% after 5 days. TDCPP metabolites were identified in the media including hydrolysis and hydroxyl-substituted dechlorination products. A dose-response separation of metabolic profiles of microalgae was observed, with effect seen at the lowest concentration of 10 mu g/L tested, which is slightly higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. Differentiated metabolites identified include 52 lipids and 6 polar metabolites. Analysis of altered lipid pathways suggests that microalgal cells reinforce thylakoid membranes (function to protect photosynthesis) by compromising the integrity of plasma membrane (function to protect cellular substances) and extraplastidial cellular membranes. Changes in the polar metabolites might indicate osmotic stress and improved NO signaling after TDCPP exposure. Consistent with perturbation of membrane lipids, further experiment confirmed that exposure to 10 mg/L TDCPP resulted in significant (p < 0.01) plasma membrane damage. This study indicates biotransformation and the membrane damage toxicity mechanism of TDCPP on S. obliquus, demonstrating the usefulness of metabolomics for the toxicity mechanism elucidation of emerging pollutants.

TI Impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) on seed germination and
   seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Microplastics and nanoplastics are emerging pollutants of global concern. However, the understanding of their ecological effects on terrestrial plants is still limited. We conducted the systematic research to reveal the impact of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) (0.01-10 mg/L) on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that PSNPs had no discernible effect on seed germination rate whereas significantly (p < 0.01) increased root elongation by 88.6 %-122.6 % when compared with the control. Similarly, remarkable increases in carbon, nitrogen contents, and plant biomass were also observed after exposure to PSNPs. Moreover, PSNPs could reduce the shoot to root biomass ratio (S:R ratio) of wheat seedlings. Furthermore, the imagings of a 3D laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PSNPs were taken up and subsequently down-top transported to shoot. The absorption and accumulation of four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in wheat were generally reduced in varying degrees. Notably, metabolomics analysis revealed that all PSNPs treatments altered the leaf metabolic profiles mainly by regulating energy metabolisms and amino acid metabolisms. These findings are expected to provide new insights into the effects of PSNPs on crop plants.

TI Understanding mixed environmental exposures using metabolomics via a
   hierarchical community network model in a cohort of California women in
   1960's
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB Even though the majority of population studies in environmental health focus on a single factor, environmental exposure in the real world is a mixture of many chemicals. The concept of "exposome" leads to an intellectual framework of measuring many exposures in humans, and the emerging metabolomics technology offers a means to read out both the biological activity and environmental impact in the same dataset. How to integrate exposome and metabolome in data analysis is still challenging. Here, we employ a hierarchical community network to investigate the global associations between the metabolome and mixed exposures including DDTs, PFASs and PCBs, in a women cohort with sera collected in California in the 1960s. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the metabolite communities associated with the exposures were non-specific and shared among exposures. This suggests that a small number of metabolic phenotypes may account for the response to a large class of environmental chemicals.

TI Reprint of "Metabolome Wide Association Study of Serum Poly and
   Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) in Pregnancy and Early Postpartum"
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) profiling of metabolic fingerprints can improve understanding of how poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) induce metabolic alterations of in utero environment and impact fetal health. HRM profiling and quantification of PFASs were performed for 397 maternal perinatal serum samples collected from 1959-1967 in the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS). We used Metabolome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) and pathway enrichment analysis for metabolic associations with PFOS, its precursor EtFOSAA, and EtFOSAA-to-PFOS ratio. Distinct metabolic profiles were found with EtFOSAA and PFOS. Urea cycle metabolites such as arginine, lysine and creatine had opposite associations with EtFOSAA (negative) and PFOS (positive); whereas, carnitine shuttle metabolites were found to be exclusively and positively associated with PFOS indicating perturbation in fatty acid metabolism. These differential metabolic associations for precursor and end-product represent an important first step in identifying how PFASs alter the in utero environment and potentially leads to disease risk.

TI Morphometric Features of Patent Foramen Ovale as a Risk Factor of
   Cerebrovascular Accidents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB Introduction: It is still disputable whether specific morphometric features of the patent foramen ovale (PFO) may stratify patients by the related probability that a discovered PFO is incidental or stroke related. Objective: We aimed to determine whether certain morphometrical characteristics of PFO are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents, using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: We performed a systematic review of electronic databases for studies that compared morphometric parameters of PFO assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in subjects with cryptogenic cerebrovascular accidents (Group 1) and control (Group 2). Data were extracted and pooled into a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 895 patients with PFO were reported (Group 1: 493, Group 2: 402). No difference was found in the PFO channel length (Group 1: 10.8 [8.6-12.9] mm vs. Group 2: 10.4 [9.1-11.7] mm), as well as in PFO height measured at rest (Group 1: 2.4 [1.5-3.3] mm vs. Group 2: 1.8 [1.4-2.2] mm). The PFO height measured during a Valsalva maneuver was larger in Group 1 (3.5 [2.8-4.1] mm) than in Group 2 (1.7 [1.2-2.2] mm). Also, the septal excursion distance was found to be larger in Group 1 (6.4 [5.1-7.8] mm) than in Group 2 (3.1 [1.8-4.4] mm). The risk of cerebrovascular accident was higher in patients with PFO and concomitant septal aneurysm (OR 4.00; 95% CI 2.63-6.09; p < 0.001) and with large right-to-left shunt PFO (OR 3.81; 95% CI 2.21-6.55; p < 0.001), no such relationship was found for the presence of a Eustachian valve or Chiari's network (OR 1.90; 95% CI 0.90-4.05; p = 0.094). Conclusions: The TEE may help in identifying PFO that are of high risk of cerebrovascular accident. Greater PFO height during a Valsalva maneuver, larger septal excursion distance, concomitant atrial septal aneurysm, and large right-to-left shunt are associated with stroke-related PFOs.

AB Microbial production of chemicals and materials from renewable carbon sources is becoming increasingly important to help establish sustainable chemical industry. In this paper, we review current status of metabolic engineering for the bio-based production of linear and saturated dicarboxylic acids and diamines, important platform chemicals used in various industrial applications, especially as monomers for polymer synthesis. Strategies for the bio-based production of various dicarboxylic acids having different carbon numbers including malonic acid (C3), succinic acid (C4), glutaric acid (C5), adipic acid (C6), pimelic acid (C7), suberic acid (C8), azelaic acid (C9), sebacic acid (C10), undecanedioic acid (C11), dodecanedioic acid (C12), brassylic acid (C13), tetradecanedioic acid (C14), and pentadecanedioic acid (C15) are reviewed. Also, strategies for the bio-based production of diamines of different carbon numbers including 1,3-diaminopropane (C3), putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane; C4), cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane; C5), 1,6-diaminohexane (C6), 1,8-diaminoctane (C8), 1,10-diaminodecane (C10), 1,12-diaminododecane (C12), and 1,14-diaminotetradecane (C14) are revisited. Finally, future challenges are discussed towards more efficient production and commercialization of bio-based dicarboxylic acids and diamines.

TI Embryo bioassays with aquatic animals for toxicity testing and hazard
   assessment of emerging pollutants: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB This review article gathers the available information on the use of embryo-tests as high-throughput tools for toxicity screening, hazard assessment and prioritization of new and existing chemical compounds. The approach is contextualized considering the new legal trends for animal experimentation, fostering the 3R policy, with reduction of experimental animals, addressing the potential of embryo-tests as high-throughput toxicity screening and prioritizing tools. Further, the current test guidelines, such as the ones provided by OECD and EPA, focus mainly in a limited number of animal lineages, particularly vertebrates and arthropods. To extrapolate hazard assessment to the ecosystem scale, a larger diversity of taxa should be tested. The use of new experimental animal models in toxicity testing, from a representative set of taxa, was thoroughly revised and discussed in this review. Here, we critically review current tools and the main advantages and drawbacks of different animal models and set researcher priorities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Perfluorooctane sulfonate alters gut microbiota-host metabolic
   homeostasis in mice
SO TOXICOLOGY
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent environmental chemical whose biological effects are mediated by multiple mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may be directly impacted by and/or alter the fate and effects of environmental chemicals in the host. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether PFOS influences the gut microbiome and its metabolism, and the host metabolome. Four groups of male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a diet with or without 0.003 %, 0.006 %, or 0.012 % PFOS, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metabolomic, and molecular analyses were used to examine the gut microbiota of mice after dietary PFOS exposure. Dietary PFOS exposure caused a marked change in the gut microbiome compared to controls. Dietary PFOS also caused dose-dependent changes in hepatic metabolic pathways including those involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, TCA cycle, glucose, and amino acid metabolism. Changes in the metabolome correlated with changes in genes that regulate these pathways. Integrative analyses also demonstrated a strong correlation between the alterations in microbiota composition and host metabolic profiles induced by PFOS. Further, using isolated mouse cecal contents, PFOS exposure directly affected the gut microbiota metabolism. Results from these studies demonstrate that the molecular and biochemical changes induced by PFOS are mediated in part by the gut microbiome, which alters gene expression and the host metabolome in mice.

TI In utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals and anogenital distance. A systematic review of
   epidemiological studies
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternaland children-related confounding factors.
   Summary sentence
   Early-life exposure to anti-androgenic endocrine disrupting chemicals provide inconsistent findings demonstrating an inverse association between higher maternal levels of some chemicals and anogenital distance, the effect being more common in male offspring.

TI A review on recent developments in the adsorption of surfactants from
   wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The pollution of the world's water resources is a growing issue which requires remediation. Surfactants used in many domestic and industrial applications are one of the emerging contaminants that require immediate attention. Treating water contaminated with surfactants using adsorption provides better performance when compared to other techniques. A variety of materials have been developed for adsorbing surfactants. Activated carbon is the most suitable adsorbent for removing surfactants but is expensive to synthesize and difficult to regenerate. Therefore, a variety of new adsorbents such as zeolites, nanomaterials, resins, biomaterials and clays have been developed as alternatives. The developed adsorbents are promising but considerable research is still required to develop highly efficient, economical, environment friendly and sustainable adsorbents to replace activated carbon. This paper critically reviews the characteristics of adsorbents, the performance of adsorbents, kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics, mechanisms of adsorption, regeneration of adsorbents and future perspectives in the adsorption of surfactants. Developing novel adsorbents, testing adsorbents in real wastewaters and recycling the adsorbents are required in future studies in the removal of surfactants.

AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles are well-known metal oxide nanoparticles having numbers of applications in the field of cosmetology, medicine, and chemistry. However, the number of reports has indicated its toxicity also such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity. Thus, in this article, we have analyzed the potential risks and benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The data related to risks and benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles have been extracted from PubMed (from January 2007 to August 2019). A total of 3,892 studies have been published during this period regarding zinc oxide nanoparticles. On the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 277 studies have been included for the analysis of risks and benefits. Emerging reports have indicated both risks and benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles in concentration- and time-dependent manner under in vitro and in vivo conditions through different mechanism of action. In conclusion, zinc oxide nanoparticles could play a beneficial role in the treatment of various diseases but safety of these particles at particular effective concentration should be thoroughly evaluated.

TI A Review on Evidence-Based Treatments for Meibomian Gland Dysfunction
SO EYE & CONTACT LENS-SCIENCE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB Objectives: To evaluate recent studies on available therapies for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Methods: A literature search on recent publications, within the last five years, concerning treatment options for MGD was performed. Results: A total of 35 articles were reviewed after curation by the authors for relevance. In general, all modalities of treatments were shown to have clinical efficacy in alleviating dry eye signs and symptoms, although the extent of improvement and persistency of outcomes varied between the different treatments. Evidence from published studies demonstrate that thermal pulsation produces the longest lasting effect per treatment, but it also incurs the highest per-treatment cost. Reusable methods for warm compress with lipid/semi-fluorinated alkane-containing eye drops are recommended as first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate dry eye patients, because this option is most technically feasible and cost-effective in clinical practice. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy and thermal pulsation may be suitable as second line for patients unresponsive to warm compress therapy; however, their respective limitations need to be considered. For refractory MGD with features of periductal fibrosis or severe blepharitis, supplementary treatment with meibomian gland probing or oral antibiotics may be used. Conclusions: All eight forms of treatments, including self-applied eyelid warming, thermal pulsation, IPL, MG probing, antibiotics, lipid-containing eye drops, and perfluorohexyloctane, were effective against MGD, although with varying extent of clinical improvements. A better understanding on the mechanisms of actions may guide physicians to make better treatment decisions targeting the root causes.

TI FIRST FAILED MACULAR HOLE SURGERY OR REOPENING OF A PREVIOUSLY CLOSED
   HOLE Do We Gain by Reoperating?-A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
SO RETINA-THE JOURNAL OF RETINAL AND VITREOUS DISEASES
AB Purpose: To evaluate repeated surgery for idiopathic full-thickness macular hole that failed to close (FTC) after first surgery or reopened (RO) once originally closed. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis. and Cochrane Library were searched for studies in English presenting outcomes of idiopathic full-thickness macular hole that FTC or RO (case reports/series of <5 cases excluded). Outcome Measures: Anatomical closure, postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, intraoperative/postoperative complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed on aggregate and available individual participant data sets using the metafor package in R. Results: Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified. After reoperation, pooled estimates for anatomical closure were 78% (95% confidence interval 71-84%) and 80% (95% confidence interval 66-89%) for FTC and RO groups, respectively. On average, best-corrected visual acuity improved in both groups. However, only 15% (28 of 189 eyes) of FTC eyes achieved best-corrected visual acuity of >= 6/12. The pooled estimated probability of >= 2-line best-corrected visual acuity improvement was 58% in the FTC group (95% confidence interval 45-71%); meta-analysis was not possible in the RO group. The most common complication was cataract. Conclusion: Reoperation for FTC or RO idiopathic full-thickness macular hole achieved a clinically meaningful visual acuity improvement in more than half of patients; high levels of vision (>= 6/12), however, were uncommon.

TI A Highly Selective and Sensitive Fluorescent Turn-Off Probe for Al3+
   Based on Polypyrimidine
SO FIBERS AND POLYMERS
AB The polyfluorene copolymers with different pyrimidine content has been synthesized and characterized by (HNMR)-H-1, (CNMR)-C-13 and FT-IR spectrum. The aggregation, acidochromicity, and metallochromicity of copolymers has been investigated. The pyrimidine content of polymer has great affect in acidochromic properties for methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and selectivity for Al3+. The colour change of copolymer/Al3+ complexes can be detected by the naked eye. The copolymers are found to be good linearly proportional to the concentration of Al3+ ions in a range from 1.0x10(-6) to 1.0x10(-3) M with a detection limit of 1.895x10(-8) M. The binding constant of the copolymer/Al3+ complexes was calculated using Benesi-Hildebrand equation and was found to be 8.95x10(5) M-1. The XPS spectroscopy, SEM micrograph and the EDS analysis reveal that the metal ion coordination occurs on the pyrimidine ring in the copolymers. This copolymer will be widely used for detection of protons and metals as fluorescent sensors.

TI Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Female Sexual Function in Obese Patients:
   a Meta-Analysis
SO OBESITY SURGERY
AB We aimed to make a meta-analysis regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on female sexual function. PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from database inception through August 2019. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they examined the effect of bariatric surgery on obese women's sexual function assessed by the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) or/and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Twenty articles were included into meta-analysis. Bariatric surgery was associated with significant increase in the total FSFI score. When parameters included in the FSFI scoring system were separately evaluated, significant improvements were observed in sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and sexual pain. However, the PISQ-12 and FSFI scores in women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) were not significantly changed postoperatively. Bariatric surgery improves female sexual function in obese patients, but not in women with PFD.

TI Recent trends in disposal and treatment technologies of
   emerging-pollutants- A critical review
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Recently pharmaceuticals are emerging as a major source of pollution for the environment. It has been well observed that the effluent discharge from hospitals has an eminent quantity of chemical waste as antibiotics, disinfectants and other treatments wastes. Pharmaceutical effluents are bioactive and their existence in the environment has been found harmful to both aquatic life and humans. In developing countries, untreated wastewaters are discharged to local water bodies by just following the local regulations. The current global challenges including high population growth rate and climate change have contributed to the widespread epidemics and emergence of diseases. Besides intractable and decaying antibiotic system, hospitals emit pathogenic waste during treatment process that can lead to situations where a total ban on hospital effluent are needed, for instance in multiple cases where discharge lead to strain on nature and quality of water. In case of pharmaceutical residues, it has been observed that only 18-32% of the pharmaceutical residues could be degraded by the secondary treatment of these seven technologies and it has been increased to 30-65% by tertiary treatment. As far as the pharmaceutical residues are concerned, it has been observed that MBR removes the residues with the efficiency of 28 -100%, varying for each pharmaceutical. This paper reviews the existing treatment processes, their advantages and future perspective of this emerging area. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A systematic review on hepatoprotective activity of quercetin against
   various drugs and toxic agents: Evidence from preclinical studies
SO PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB Quercetin is one of the most abundant flavonoids in human diet that has been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of quercetin were discussed in this review. Quercetin exhibited hepatoprotective activity against 2-butoxyethanol, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, aflatoxin B1, aroclor-1254, arsenic, sodium arsenite, azathioprine, cadmium chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chlorpyrifos, cyclosporine A, diazinon, dimethylnitrosamine, doxorubicin, epirubicin, ethanol, fenvalerate, isoniazide, rifampicin, lead acetate, lindane, D-galactosamine, methotrexate, methylmercury, nickel sulfate, paracetamol, perfluorooctanoic acid, polychlorinated biphenyls, pyrrolizidine alkaloid clivorine, rotenone, sodium fluoride, streptazotocin, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, thioacetamide, titanium dioxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tripterygium glycoside, triptolide, ultraviolet A light, concavalin A, bisphenol, and ischemia-induced hepatotoxicity in various animal models due to its antioxidant, free radical-scavenging,anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) inhibitory activities. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms by which quercetin reduced the hepatotoxicity of different hepatotoxicants. This will help the toxicologists, pharmacologists, and chemists to develop new safer pharmaceutical products with quercetin and other hepatotoxicants.

TI Occurrence, formation, environmental fate and risks of environmentally
   persistent free radicals in biochars
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Biochars are used globally in agricultural crop production and environmental remediation. However, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), which are stable emerging pollutants, are generated as a characteristic feature during biomass pyrolysis. EPFRs can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which poses huge agro-environmental and human health risks. Their half-lives and persistence in both biochar residues and in the atmosphere may lead to potentially adverse risks in the environment. This review highlights the comprehensive research into these bioreactive radicals, as well as the bottlenecks of biochar production leading up to the formation and persistence of EPFRs. Additionally, a way forward has been proposed, based on two main recommendations. A global joint initiative to create an all-encompassing regulations policy document that will improve both the technological and the quality control aspects of biochars to reduce EPFR generation at the production level. Furthermore, environmental impact and risk assessment studies should be conducted in the extensive applications of biochars in order to protect the environmental and human health. The highlighted key research directions proposed herein will shape the production, research, and adoption aspects of biochars, which will mitigate the considerable concerns raised on EPFRs.

TI Occurrence, interactive effects and ecological risk of diclofenac in
   environmental compartments and biota - a review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Didofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug has turned into a contaminant of emerging concern; hence, it was included in the previous Watch List of the EU Water Framework Directive. This review paper aims to highlight the metabolism of diclofenac at different trophic levels, its occurrence, ecological risks, and interactive effects in the water cycle and biota over the past two decades. Increased exposure to diclofenac not only raises health concerns for vultures, aquatic organisms, and higher plants but also causes serious threats to mammals. The ubiquitous nature of didofenac in surface water (river, lake canal, estuary, and sea) is compared with drinking water, groundwater, and wastewater effluent in the environment. This comprehensive survey from previous studies suggests the fate of didofenac in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may predict its persistence in the environment. This review offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the water environment, soil, sediment, and biota worldwide and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of diclofenac in the environment. Finally, we suggest that the presence of didofenac and its metabolites in the environment may represent a high risk because of their synergistic interactions with existing contaminants, leading to the development of drug-resistant strains and the formation of newly emerging pollutants.

TI Metabolomic analysis reveals metabolic alterations of human peripheral
   blood lymphocytes by perfluorooctanoic acid
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a dispersive persistent organic pollutant in the environment. Accumulating reports suggest that PFOA is toxic to human lymphocytes; however, the toxicological effects of PFOA on these cells remain largely unclear. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-based metabolomic analysis was employed to identify metabolites in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and to assess the metabolic alterations caused by PFOA exposure. Our comparative metabolomic analysis results demonstrated that PFOA treatment could increase the level of organic acids and reduce the level of lipid molecules. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation further highlighted the fact that the PFOA treatment interfered with the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which may lead to disruption of the immune system.

TI Enhancing the Durability of Membrane Electrode Assembly of Proton
   Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells
SO PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has attracted huge attention recently due to its high energy conversion efficiency, low operating temperature and environmental benign. With the launch of the Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle by Toyota in 2014, a new wave of industrialization of fuel cells and fuel cell vehicles has been brought about. However, enhancing the durability of PEMFC and developing a new generation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and fuel cells are still challenging topics in the field. The MEA is the core component of PEMFC, and its durability directly determines the life of the fuel cell. The MEA is mainly composed of a proton exchange membrane, anode and cathode catalyst layers and gas diffusion layers on both sides. In last decade, great efforts have been paid to improving the durability of MEAs/PEMFCs from three aspects, membrane, catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer. In this paper, we introduce these research works systematically, and a review and prospect for the research and development of this topic in the future is also made.

TI Insights into the isotherm and kinetic models for the coadsorption of
   pharmaceuticals in the absence and presence of metal ions: A review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Pharmaceuticals are a wide class of emerging pollutants due to their continuous and the increasing consumption of users. These pollutants are usually found in the real environment as mixtures alone or with metal ions. Thus, the migration risk increases, which complicates the removal of pharmaceuticals because of the combined and synergistic effects. The focus of treatment of pharmaceutical mixtures and their coexistence with metals is of considerable importance. For this purpose, adsorption has been efficiently applied to several studies for the treatment of such complex systems. In this article, the coadsorption behavior of pharmaceuticals in the absence and existence of metals on several adsorbents has been reviewed. The adsorption isotherms and kinetics of these two systems have been analyzed using different models and discussed. Important challenges and promising routes are suggested for the future development of the coadsorption of the studied systems. This article provides an overview on the most utilized and effective adsorbents, widely studied adsorbates, best applied isotherm and kinetic models, and competitive effect in coadsorption of pharmaceuticals, both with and without metals.

TI Research and Technological Advances Regarding the Study of the Spread of
   Antimicrobial Resistance Genes and Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria
   Related to Animal Husbandry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The extensive use of antimicrobials in animal farms poses serious safety hazards to both the environment and public health, and this trend is likely to continue. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are a class of emerging pollutants that are difficult to remove once introduced. Understanding the environmental transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARGs is pivotal for creating control measures. In this review, we summarize the research progress on the spread and detection of ARB and ARG pollution related to animal husbandry. Molecular methods such as high-throughput sequencing have greatly enriched the information about ARB communities. However, it remains challenging to delineate mechanisms regarding ARG induction, transmission, and tempo-spatial changes in the whole process, from animal husbandry to multiple ecosystems. As a result, future research should be more focused on the mechanisms of ARG induction, transmission, and control. We also expect that future research will rely more heavily on metagenomic -analysis, metatranscriptomic sequencing, and multi-omics technologies

TI Replacement for patellofemoral arthritis
SO KNEE
AB Background: Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) is relatively common, affecting 24% females and 11% males over the age of 55 years. Most patients can be treated conservatively. Arthroplasty remains the ultimate procedure for end stage PFOA. Debate continues as to whether total knee replacement (TKR) or patellofemoral replacement (PFR) is better for this group of patients. The aim of this article is to review the current evidence for use of these two procedures in this condition.
   Methods: Recent meta-analyses, systematic reviews and appropriate cohort publications concerning surgical management of PFOA were sourced. A cohort of patients from the authors' own institution was also reviewed. An instructional lecture was then created and delivered at the British Association for Surgery of the Knee 2019 annual conference, on behalf of the British Patellofemoral Society. This article has been written based on this lecture.
   Results: It is clear that PFOA is a different disease process than tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TFOA). There is no doubt that PFR has a higher failure rate than TKR, but evidence suggests that outcomes and recovery may be better in the PFR group. This is complicated by subsets of those with PFOA faring better than others, the reasons for which are likely to be multifactorial.
   Conclusions: Both PFR and TKR may be used appropriately for PFOA. In keeping with a shared decision-making process, patients should be counselled appropriately preoperatively when deciding between these procedures. Further research is required to understand the differences in outcome between procedures and in subsets of patients with PFOA. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Efficient PFAS Removal by Amine-Functionalized Sorbents: Critical Review
   of the Current Literature
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of persistent and mobile fluoro-organic chemicals that have been detected in many water supplies, and their recommended safe concentrations in drinking water are as low as 6 ng/L. Current technological advances suggest that amine-containing sorbents can provide alternative solutions to PFAS control in the treatment of municipal water and wastewater at relatively low PFAS concentrations. The objective of this review is to provide critical analysis of the development and application of amine-containing sorbents for PFAS removal. The removal of PFAS by aminated sorbents relies on the combined effects of three main factors: (i) electrostatic interactions with functional groups of the sorbent, (ii) hydrophobic interactions with the sorbent and between PFAS molecules, and (iii) sorbent morphology. The design of next-generation sorbents should take into consideration these three factors and their relative contribution. We also provide an outlook and highlight of the key areas of innovative research needs to develop more efficient sorbents that will enable compliance with the increasingly stringent regulations of PFAS.

TI A critical review on passive sampling in air and water for per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Passive sampling methods have been widely used for monitoring pollutants in different environments due to their advantages including simplicity to use and time-integrated sampling. Despite the advantages, challenges still exist and are associated with the calibration and implementation of passive sampling, in particular for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) due to their unique physico-chemical properties. In the current review, we focus on the calibration and use of passive samplers for PFASs in air and water. The comparison of the sampling rates generally showed a higher variability for the aqueous passive samplers compared to the passive air samplers. A better standardization for calibration methods for PFASs in air and water is needed. Nevertheless, passive samplers are an ideal tool for monitoring PFASs in air and water and can identify spatial or temporal trends and pollution sources, variations in water quality and ultimately improve our understanding of the global distribution of PFASs.

TI An overview of omics approaches to characterize the effect of
   perfluoroalkyl substances in environmental health
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The production and widespread use of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has led to their presence in the environment, wildlife, and the human body. PFAS exposure has been indicated that could adversely affect human health. PFASs trigger chemical signals to cells, which further emit new signals to tissues and even to organs, and finally cause diseases. Detection of these signals and understanding of the meaning behind them are great challenges, which may be tackled through high-throughput 'omics' technologies, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This review summarizes the analytical methodologies, such as sequencing, microarray, mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), used in these 'omics' technologies and therefore applied in the bioanalysis of PFAS-related health risks. We provide a summary of the important roles that analytic methodologies have played in the study of human health. We also focus on new analytical technologies that will certainly shed light on new health-related fields. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction and hypothesis Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), including urinary incontinence (UI), faecal incontinence (FI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP), are common debilitating conditions globally, with considerable variation of prevalence reported in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was hypothesised that the variation could be due to both random and non-random errors. The aim was to determine the pooled prevalence estimates of PFDs among community-dwelling women in LMICs and to examine possible reasons for the variations of prevalence reported. Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Maternity & Infant Care was conducted to retrieve eligible studies. A meta-analysis with a random effects model and a meta-regression were performed. The manuscript was structured using the PRISMA checklist . Results A total of 49 studies were included. The overall pooled prevalence of PFDs in LMICs was 25% (95% CI 22-29%). The pooled prevalence of UI, FI and POP was 30% (95% CI 25-35%), 8% (95% CI 4-11%) and 15% (95% CI 10-20%), respectively. A significant difference in the prevalence of UI was found between studies conducted in low and lower middle-income and upper middle-income countries and for FI between studies that used validated and non-validated questionnaires. Other methodological features did not show any effect on the variation of prevalence estimates of UI, FI and POP. Conclusions PFDs affect a substantial proportion of women in LMICs. Since methodological heterogeneity was unexplained, this review suggests the need for large nationally representative population-based surveys to provide reliable estimates of the prevalence of PFDs in LMICs.

TI Adsorption of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from
   aqueous solution - A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have gained increasingly global attention in recent years. Due to their unique amphiphilic properties and stability, PFASs are recognized as highly persistent, toxic, and environmentally bioaccumulative. Among several physicochemical technologies, adsorption has been extensively used and proved to be an effective method for removing PFASs from aqueous environment. In this review article, the technical feasibility of the use of different adsorbents, such as activated carbon, ion exchange resins, minerals, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and a wide range of potentially low-cost biosorbents, for PFASs removal from water or wastewater is critically reviewed. The evaluation and comparison of their PFASs sorption behavior in terms of kinetics and isotherms is presented. The mechanisms involved in PFASs adsorption processes, such as diffusion, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange and hydrogen bond, are discussed. The effects of the parameters variability on sorption process are highlighted. Based on the literature reviewed, a few recommendations for future research on PFASs adsorption are also elaborated.

TI Teflon (TM) or Ivalon (R): a scoping review of implants used in
   microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia
SO NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by jolts of pain along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. If patients fail conservative management, microvascular decompression (MVD) is the next step in treatment. MVD is largely done by placing implant pads between the nerve and compressing vessels. We conducted a literature review to assess effectiveness and safety of Teflon (TM) and Ivalon (R) sponges for treatment of TN with MVD. Methods In January 2019, PubMed was searched for manuscripts published in English using permutations of "Microvascular decompression", "Teflon", "Ivalon", "Granuloma", "Polytetrafluoroethylene", "Trigeminal Neuralgia", and "Exploration". Success and relapse rates, causes of relapse, and complication rates were analyzed. We analyzed for relationships with ANCOVA at an alpha threshold of .05. Results Thirty-six studies representing 4273 patients fit inclusion criteria. Twenty-five dealt with initial MVD, 12 with re-do MVD. Initial MVD initial success rates were 85% in patients receiving Teflon (TM) (57-100%*) and 91% in patients receiving Ivalon (R) (79-100%*). Recurrence rates were 12% in Teflon (TM) patients (0*-30%) and 9.1% in Ivalon (R) patients (0*-19%). In patients with relapses, implants were the cause in 49% of Teflon (TM) patients (0*-100%*) and 50% of Ivalon (R) patients (0*-100%*). Complication rates for patients receiving Teflon (TM) were 12% (0*-34%) and 19% for patients receiving Ivalon (R) (0*-40%). Conclusion Teflon (TM) and Ivalon (R) are two materials used in MVD for TN. It is an effective treatment with long-term symptom relief and recurrence rates of 1-5% each year. Ivalon (R) has been used less than Teflon (TM) though is associated with similar success rates and similar complication rates.

TI Analytical methodologies for the determination of pharmaceuticals and
   personal care products (PPCPs) in sewage sludge: A critical review
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Several analytical approaches have been developed for the determination of emerging pollutants (EPs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in environmental matrices. This paper reviews the sample preparation and instrumental methods proposed in the last few years (2012-2018) to assess PPCPs in sewage sludge. Three main steps are examined: extraction, clean-up and analysis. Sample preparation is critical as target compounds are normally found at low concentrations in complex matrices. Most procedures include sewage sludge pretreatment mostly through ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) although other novel techniques such as QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) or MSPD (matrix solid-phase dispersion) have been also employed. In one report, no differences in extraction efficiency were detected among the most commonly used extraction techniques such as ultrasound, microwave and pressurized liquid. Clean-up usually involves a conventional method such as solid phase extraction (SPE). This step is needed to appreciably reduce matrix suppression, and is followed by an instrumental analysis using techniques of preference such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC), mostly coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). A fully automated on-line system that includes extraction, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometry in one-stage is here presented as a novel way of determining PPCPs in sewage sludge. This review also discusses the advantages and limitations of the different techniques used. Miniaturizing analytical techniques and the use of novel solid and liquid phase materials are emerging as efficient options that fulfill the principles of so-called "green chemistry".

TI Persistence and impact of steroidal estrogens on the environment and
   their laccase-assisted removal
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Steroidal estrogens are widespread water contaminants with potential carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting activities. The World Health Organization has listed estrogens as group 1 carcinogens. These contaminants are of substantial concern because of potential threats to human health, and aquatic organisms on long-term exposure. A range of methods, including oxidation, adsorption, electrochemical, and irradiation techniques have been employed for their remediation from aqueous systems. However, inadequate removal, toxic sludge generation, high operating costs, and the requisite for skilled operating and maintenance personnel commercially hampered the application of many methods. An interesting alternative treatment approach based on the use of oxidoreductases, particularly laccases, has recently gained amicability for the biotransformation of emerging pollutants. The use of immobilized enzymes is more cost-effective from an industrial perspective due to improved catalytic stability, reusability, reduction of product inhibition, and easier product separation. This review provides comprehensive knowledge on the use of laccases in the biodegradation of steroidal estrogens. including estrone. 17 beta-estradiol. and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol with endocrine-disrupting potency from the environment. After an overview of estrogens and catalytic properties of laccase, the use of free, as well as immobilized laccases with a particular emphasis on estrogens removal by lactase-based fed-batch, packed bed bioreactors, and membrane reactors, is discussed. A comparison of existing treatment technologies with enzyme technology for the removal of estrogens from different environmental matrices is made. Lastly, along with concluding remarks, future research aimed at bridging knowledge gaps for estrogenic compounds removal are also proposed in this very important research area. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Spatial and temporal variability of perfluoroalkyl substances in the
   Laurentian Great Lakes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of fluorinated organic chemicals that have been used in industrial and consumer applications since the 1950s. PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered.

TI Perfluoro-3-ethyl-2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl persistent radical: A new
   reagent for direct, metal-free radical trifluoromethylation and polymer
   initiation
SO JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY
AB This review comprehensively profiles perfluoro-3-ethyl-2,4-dimethyl-3-pentyl persistent radical (PPFR) as a new reagent for radical trifluoromethylation, trifluoromethylation/fluorination and polymer initiation. The PPFR is perfectly stable at ambient conditions, but at temperatures above 80 degrees C undergoes beta-scission to generate trifluommethyl radical. This property can be used to initiate various chain-polymerization or trifluoromethylation reactions. The unique feature of this process, distinguishing it from all other known methods for center dot CF3-radical generation, is that the radical is produced under neutral, inert and additive-free conditions. Hopefully, the mild reaction conditions and commercial availability of PPFR will generate research interest for practical applications of this novel perfluorination reagent for fluorination and polymerization processes.

TI A review of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell durability for
   vehicular applications: Degradation modes and experimental techniques
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Durability is one of the most significant technical barriers to successful commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells for practical vehicular applications. It is determined by the aging (degradation) and malfunction of various components during the long-term operation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of degradation modes in different components is crucial to the development of high-performing and long-lasting PEM fuel cells. In this review article, the critical degradation modes in major cell components, including membranes, catalyst layers, gas diffusion layers, and distribution plates, are comprehensively reviewed and analyzed, and the potential causes are described. Advanced experimental techniques to investigate the PEM fuel cell degradation modes reported in literature include steady-state durability tests and accelerated stress tests (ASTs). The steady-state durability test is straightforward but time-consuming and costly; therefore, ASTs are often applied to accelerate durability testing. For comparable results among different research studies, the experimental protocols and conditions have to be consistent, and the details of these experimental techniques are systematically reviewed in this article. The experimental results with a focus on the degradation modes, degradation rate, and test time of the PEM fuel cells have been reported. Finally, in order to understand the root causes of degradation modes and to develop the mitigation strategies, ex-situ ASTs in literature have been reviewed, including the effects of cyclic temperature, humidity, water wet-dry, freeze-thaw, clamping stress, and vibration operations.

TI Seminal plasma metabolites mediate the associations of multiple
   environmental pollutants with semen quality in Chinese men
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Environmental exposure to arsenic, phthalate esters (PAEs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) has been associated with human semen quality. However, the epidemiological "black-box" of these associations remains poorly uncovered. In this study, based on the association analysis between arsenic, PAE and PFC exposure and semen quality parameters (i.e., semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm count, progressive motility, total motility and normal morphology) in a Chinese male population, we explored the seminal plasma metabolic signatures that may mediate the exposure-outcome relations by using the meet-in-metabolite-analysis (MIMA) approach. As a result, a negative association was found between DMA and sperm concentration, whereas MEHP and PFHxS were positively associated with sperm count and concentration, respectively. Metabolomics analysis revealed that sixteen and twenty-two seminal plasma metabolites were related to sperm concentration and count, respectively, and they are mainly involved in fatty acid, lipid and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, it was further indicated that eicosatetraenoate, carnitines and DHA may impact the inverse association between DMA and sperm concentration, while eicosatetraenoate, carnitines, DHA, PGB2 and tocotrienol are possible mediators of the positive association between PFHxS and sperm concentration. As these metabolic biomarkers are relevant to antioxidation and fatty acid beta-oxidation, we suggest that redox balance and energy generation shifts in seminal plasma are involved in the association of human semen quality with environmental DMA and PFHxS exposure.

TI Treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in landfill leachate:
   status, chemistry and prospects
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been widely detected in municipal landfills due to the massive uses of PFAS in everyday consumer products. PFAS in landfill leachate can contaminate the neighbouring soil and groundwater and pose serious health concerns to human and ecosystems. Yet, information is lacking on the distribution, transformation and fate of various PFAS in landfills, and on the treatment technologies to remove or degrade PFAS in landfill leachate. As the relevant regulations are rapidly evolving, the research and technology development have been gaining momentum in recent years. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the state of the science on the occurrence and treatment technologies of PFAS in landfills. Specifically, this review aims to overview the following aspects: 1) the occurrence and transformation of PFAS under typical landfill environmental conditions, 2) the chemistry and state-of-art technologies for treating PFAS in landfill leachate, including adsorption, biodegradation, photo-degradation, and membrane processes, and 3) the key knowledge gaps and future research/technology needs for controlling PFAS from landfills.

TI Non-invasive molecular genetic prenatal tests (NIPT) for detection of

SO MEDIZINISCHE GENETIK
AB Background Non-invasive molecular genetic prenatal tests (NIPTs) for trisomy have long been part of non-invasive prenatal diagnostics. In Germany it is currently being examined whether and for whom these tests should be paid for by statutory health insurance in the future. Objective (I) Diagnostic properties of NIPTs for the detection of trisomy 13, 18 and 21, and (II) hypothetical calculation of the possible use of NIPTs in different groups. Methods (I) Systematic search for primary literature and systematic reviews in MEDLINE and four other databases. Inclusion criteria: Studies in pregnant women; index test: NIPT using molecular genetic analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood to determine the trisomy risk; reference test: cytogenetic diagnostics or postnatal clinical examination. (II) Exploratory search. Hypothetical calculations for (1) all pregnant women following the current procedure without NIPTs using the example of first-trimester screening (FTS), (2) application in pregnant women with an increased risk (e.g., after preceding FTS), and (3) application of NIPT in a population with and without an increased trisomy risk. Results In the 22 studies included, sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 detection were 99.13% (95% CI: [97.39%; 99.72%]) and 99.95% (95% CI: [99.88%; 99.98%]). The possible influence of test failures was not considered in the calculations, and thus the sensitivity or specificity of NIPTs may have been overestimated. For the detection of trisomy 13 and 18, the sensitivity could not be robustly estimated. Discussion In pregnant women with an increased risk, NIPT can probably reduce the number of invasive tests and thus the number of test-related miscarriages.

TI Recent advancements in visible-light-assisted photocatalytic removal of
   aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB Pharmaceuticals are one of the persistent emerging contaminants that are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment due to their extensive application as human and veterinary medicines. The ecotoxicity and microbial resistance are considered to be major adverse environmental and health impact of pharmaceuticals even in trace amounts, which raise global concern. The recalcitrant nature of these pollutants restricts the application of the conventional treatment system for their remediation and triggers extensive research on the various advanced oxidation processes as a promising treatment system. Among them, visible-light-assisted semiconductor photocatalysis has significant potential as an efficient, low-cost, and green technology, which can use even solar energy as a clean and sustainable light source. A comprehensive review on the application of various visible light photocatalysts on the degradation of aqueous pharmaceutical pollutants was attempted to highlight their physiochemical properties, reaction mechanism, and catalytic activity in the laboratory- as well as field-scale operations. The challenges and gaps in the current literature have been identified, and recommendations for prospective research opportunities have been placed based on the findings.

TI Regulation of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonic
   Acid (PFOS) in Drinking Water: A Comprehensive Review
SO WATER
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are receiving global attention due to their persistence in the environment through wastewater effluent discharges and past improper industrial waste disposal. They are resistant to biological degradation and if present in wastewater are discharged into the environment. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued drinking water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS at 70 ng/L each and for the sum of the two. The need for an enforceable primary drinking water regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is currently being assessed. The USEPA faces stringent legal constraints and technical barriers to develop a primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS. This review synthesizes current knowledge providing a publicly available, comprehensive point of reference for researchers, water utilities, industry, and regulatory agencies to better understand and address cross-cutting issues associated with regulation of PFOA and PFOS contamination of drinking water.

TI On the role of review papers in the face of escalating publication rates
   - a case study of research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs)
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB In the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in scientific publications dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and the escalating publication rate makes it close to impossible for individual researchers to get an overview of the field. Assuring the relevance and quality of the research conducted in any research field is a crucially important task. The rapidly increasing publication rates imply that review papers will play a progressively more central role to that end. The aim of the present paper is to critically assess whether reviews dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue about methodological weaknesses, uncertainties, research gaps and the future direction of the field. We carried out a tiered content-analysis of CEC review papers. Relevant papers were identified through searches in Web of Science (Clarivate), leading to the identification of 6391 original research papers of which 193 are review papers. We find that the majority of CEC reviews are written as if they are comprehensive, even though this clearly is not the case. A minority (similar to 20%) take a critical-analytical approach to the reviewing task and identify weaknesses and research gaps. The following widespread tendencies in CEC research papers are commonly noted as concerning: to equate removal of CECs to 'decreased concentrations in the effluent'; to focus on parent substances and not concern oneself with degradation products; to focus on most commonly studied substances rather than those of most concern; to not deal with the corollary of our inability to detect or assess the risk for all substances, and to give insufficient attention to uncertainties and the unknown. Several critical-analytical reviews are among the highest cited, which suggests that they have the potential to function as effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue on these topics. On the other hand, it would appear that the concerns expressed in these reviews have a limited impact, as the same concerns are repeated over time. This might be due to a tendency among review authors to express their concerns implicitly, instead of clearly spelling them out. Our study suggests that CEC reviews presently fail to provide adequate and reliable guidance regarding the relevance and quality of research in the field. We argue that the overwhelming number of publications in combination with a lack of quality criteria for review papers are reasons to this failure: it is well documented that choices made during the reviewing process have a major impact on the outcome of a review. These choices include: search engine; the criteria used to include or exclude papers; the criteria used to assess the quality of the data generated in the research papers included; the criteria used for the choice of substances/ organisms/ technologies reported on. The lack of transparent procedures makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the quality of the findings presented or to put those findings in context. In this light, it is noteworthy that criteria for a good review paper are rarely spelled out by peer-reviewed journals or included in instructions on scientific writing. The dramatic increase in publications is a challenge for the entire research community, particularly for research fields that are expected to provide policy-relevant data.
   We argue that only when peer-reviewed journals start specifying quality criteria for review papers, can such papers be relied upon to provide adequate and strategic guidance on the development of CEC research. We anticipate that our findings and conclusions are valid for many other research fields.

TI The Paterno-Buchi reaction - a comprehensive review
SO PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The photochemical reaction between an excited state of carbonyl compounds and an alkene to give the oxetane deriving from a cycloaddition reaction (the Paterno-Buchi reaction) is presented. The mechanism of the reaction is discussed on the basis of kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical evidence, showing that the reaction can involve both singlet and triplet excited states of the carbonyl compounds, the high probable presence of an exciplex, and the possible presence of electron transfer processes, and when triplet excited carbonyl compounds are involved, the presence of a biradical intermediate is observed. The reactivity of electron-poor and electron-rich alkenes is discussed. Regio- and stereochemical behavior of the reaction are presented showing that, in some cases, very high regio- and stereoselectivities are obtained. The possible theories explaining this behavior are presented. In this field, the stereoselectivity observed, when chiral auxiliaries are used, when the reaction is performed in organized media, and when the presence of a hydroxyl directing effect can be supposed, is presented. The effect of light, temperature, solvent on the reaction is discussed. The possible application of this reaction in organic synthesis is discussed, presenting both previous synthetic schemes where the synthesis of an oxetane is a key step, the possible use of the oxetane in synthesis, and comparing the photochemical approach with the other approaches used to synthesize the oxetane ring.

TI A comprehensive review on the reasons behind low power conversion
   efficiency of dibenzo derivatives based donors in bulk heterojunction
   organic solar cells
SO ORGANIC ELECTRONICS
AB Small molecules and polymer derivatives based on fused ring system of dibenzo [b,d]thiophene, dibenzo[b,d] silole, dibenzo[b,d]furan, dibenzo [b,d] germole, dibenzo [b,d]selenophene and dibenzo[b,d]tellurophene are efficient donor (D) materials for bulk heterojunction organic solar cell (BHJ-OSCs) applications. Dibenzo based hetero-tricyclic fused ring systems showed poor PCE than other ring system due to low T-conjugation, disorder in structure, poor solubility, higher d-spacing of Tr-TC stacking in thin film state, low hole mobility and air stability. To further improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fused ring derivatives, we have to incorporate heteroatoms (P-block elements N, S, Si, Ge, Ga, Sn, and Se) and tailor three member ring based donor system. This review briefly summarizes the data on fused ring system based small molecules or polymers for BHJ-OSCs application and gives suggestion to design new donor materials with desired properties.

TI Persistent organic pollutants in typical lake ecosystems
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic organic chemicals. Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in multiple matrices in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food web, and thus pose a potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but also to human health. Given their potential persistent risks, they have received much attention over the past decades. This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide, involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake ecosystems.

TI The incidence and risk of infusion phlebitis with peripheral intravenous
   catheters: A meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF VASCULAR ACCESS
AB Introduction: Phlebitis is a common complication associated with the use of peripheral intravenous catheters. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheter use and to identify risk factors for phlebitis development. Method: Literature survey was conducted in electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid, and PubMed), and studies were included if they used peripheral intravenous catheter for therapeutic or volumetric infusion and reported phlebitis incidence rates. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain overall and subgroup phlebitis incidence rates and odds ratio between males and females in phlebitis incidence. Results: Thirty-five studies were included (20,697 catheters used for 15,791 patients; age 57.1 years (95% confidence interval: 55.0, 59.2); 53.9% males (95% confidence interval: 42.3, 65.5)). Incidence of phlebitis was 30.7 per 100 catheters (95% confidence interval: 27.2, 34.2). Incidence of severe phlebitis was 3.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.7%, 4.6%). Incidence of phlebitis was higher in non-intervened (30% (95% confidence interval: 27%, 33%)) than in intervened (21% (95% confidence interval: 15%, 27%)) groups, and with Teflon (33% (95% confidence interval: 25%, 41%)) than Vialon (27% (95% confidence interval: 21%, 32%)) cannula use. Odds of developing phlebitis was significantly higher in females (odds ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.93); p = 0.02). Longer dwelling time, antibiotics infusion, female gender, forearm insertion, infectious disease, and Teflon catheter are important risk factors for phlebitis development identified by the included studies. Conclusion: Incidence of phlebitis with the use of peripheral intravenous catheters during infusion is 31%. Severe phlebitis develops in 4% of all patients. Risk of phlebitis development can be reduced by adapting appropriate interventions.

TI New Ratios for Performance Improvement for Identifying Acyl-CoA
   Dehydrogenase Deficiencies in Expanded Newborn Screening: A
   Retrospective Study
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Some success in identifying acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) deficiencies before they are symptomatic has been achieved through tandem mass spectrometry. However, there has been several challenges that need to be confronted, including excess false positives, the occasional false negatives and indicators selection. To select ideal indicators and evaluate their performance for identifying ACAD deficiencies, data from 352,119 newborn babies, containing 20 cases, were used in this retrospective study. A total of three new ratios, C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1, and C14:1/C16-OH, were selected from 43 metabolites. Around 903 ratios derived from pairwise combinations of all metabolites via multivariate logistic regression analysis were used. In the current study, the regression analysis was performed to identify short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. In both model-building and testing data, the C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1 and C14:1/C16-OH were found to be better indicators for SCAD, MCAD and VLCAD deficiencies, respectively, compared to [C4, (C4, C4/C2)], [C8, (C6, C8, C8/C2, C4DC+C5-OH/C8:1)], and [C14:1, (C14:1, C14:1/C16, C14:1/C2)], respectively. In addition, 22 mutations, including 5 novel mutations and 17 reported mutations, in ACADS, ACADM, and ACADL genes were detected in 20 infants with ACAD deficiency by using high-thorough sequencing based on target capture. The pathogenic mutations of c.1031A > G in ACADS, c.449_452delCTGA in ACADM and c.1349G > A in ACADL were found to be hot spots in Suzhou patients with SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD, respectively. In conclusion, we had identified three new ratios that could improve the performance for ACAD deficiencies compared to the used indicators. We considered to utilize C4/C5DC+C6-OH, C8/C14:1, and C14:1/C16-OH as primary indicators for SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD deficiency, respectively, in further expanded newborn screening practice. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in Suzhou population enriches genetic data of Chinese patients with one of ACAD deficiencies.

TI A critical review on organic micropollutants contamination in wastewater
   and removal through carbon nanotubes
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The prevalence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in various environmental compartments is posing a serious health risks to all kinds of lives on the planet. The levels of OMPs such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics, pesticides, contraceptive medicines, and personal care products in water bodies are increasing with each passing day. It is an urgent need of time to limit the release of OMPs into the environment, and to remove the prevailing OMPs for sustainable environmental management. The majority of the conventional means of water decontamination are either inefficient or expensive. However, due to nanosize, high surface area, and hollow and layered structure, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as excellent sorbents for the removal of a diverse range of OMPs. The occurrence of emerging OMPs and their detrimental effects on human and animal health are collected and discussed in this review. The characteristics and efficacy of various CNTs (pristine and modified) for the efficient removal of different OMPs, and the removal mechanisms have been reviewed and discussed. The literature demonstrated that adsorption of OMPs onto CNTs is very complicated and rely on multiple factors including the properties of adsorbent and the adsorbate as well as solution chemistry. It was found that H-bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, H-pi bongs, and pi-pi interactions were the major mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of OMPs onto various kinds of CNTs. Despite of higher affinities for OMPs, hydrophobicity and higher costs restrain the practical application of CNTs for wastewater treatment on large scale. However, continuous production may lead to the development of cost-effective, efficient and eco-friendly CTNs technology for wastewater treatments in future.

TI Occupational and environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and
   risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of
   epidemiology studies
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
AB We carryied out a meta-analysis of studies on exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Through a systematic search of the literature, we identified relative risks (RRs) for PCB exposure and NHL risk in 30 populations (10 occupational exposure, seven high environmental exposure, 13 without special exposure). We performed random effects meta-analyses for exposure to all PCBs, specific PCB congeners and risk of all NHL and NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for studies of occupational exposure, high environmental exposure, and no special exposure were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-1.03], 1.05 (95% CI: 0.94-1.16), and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.72-1.34), respectively, and the cumulative meta-RR was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85-1.07). No positive associations were found for exposure to specific congeners, nor for NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for an increase of 100 ppb serum or fat PCB level was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00-1.04). There was weak indication of publication bias. Our meta-analysis found no association between PCB exposure and NHL risk, in particular in studies of occupational exposures. We detected a weak dose-response relation; the possibility of residual confounding and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out. PCBs are not likely to cause NHL in humans.

TI Accurate Determination of Major Elements of Alloys Using Low Power XRF
   Spectrometer
SO BUNSEKI KAGAKU
AB An accurate determination procedure of major elements of metal alloy was studied by a home-made compact X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument. This XRF instrument was composed with a low-power X-ray tube, silicon drift detector and home-made small volume of liquid flow cell. The flow cell has volume of 0.2 mL and a window covered with 12 micron polypropylene film. A metallic alloy of 0.2 g was dissolved with a small portion of acidic reagent in a Teflon bottle, and then diluted to sample solution of 10 mL. A portion of the sample solution and internal element solution were mixed by weight and prepared to a sample solution of about 5 mL. We then flowed about 2 mL of this sample solution to the XRF instrument. All spectra of the sample solution were obtained at 3 W of the X-ray tube power output and a 60 sec accumulation time. Major elements of metallic alloy were determined from gross counts or net counts using an internal standard correction method. The recovered weight, that is, the sum weight of the major elements determined by the procedure described above for three kind of iron alloy and two kind of brass, were exactly matched with actually dissolved alloy weight. Concretely, value which was divided by the actually dissolved alloy weight of recovered weight, was obtained in the range of 99.9 % to 103.0 %. The statistical error was under 2 percent in all cases. Additionally, peak overlapping effects on the accuracy of the elemental determination values for neodymium magnet, which was contained with four rare earth elements was discussed. From the experiment, elemental determination analysis in solution was easily and quickly able to carried out by this compact XRF instrument with liquid flow cell. So that, it is concluded that this method by this XRF instrument with liquid flow cell is effective for the accurate determination of the major element analysis of a metal alloy.

TI On the relation between the Mason number and the durability of MR fluids
SO SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
AB The durability of magnetorheological (MR) fluid is a fundamental aspect of any MR device, as MR fluid is submitted to shear stresses that cause its degradation. While various studies have identified MR fluid degradation behaviors and proposed improvements, there exists no generalized failure theory to help understand the in-use degradation of MR fluids. In this regard, this study suggests that a relation exists between the Mason number and the maximum achievable lifetime dissipated energy (LDE) of MR fluids. To validate this hypothesis, custom (perfluoropolyether) and commercial (hydrocarbon) MR fluids are aged in various Mason number conditions using a clutch-type durability device. Experimental results show that under a critical Mason number of similar to 1, LDE of the MR fluids can be related to the Mason Number using an analogy to metal fatigue failure. Above this critical Mason number, the fundamental degradation mechanism appears to change from a dominant mechanical wear of the particles (i.e. particle-limited) to another mechanism (i.e. fluid-limited) which is not yet fully understood. Since MR generally operate well below the critical Mason number of similar to 1, the relation between the Mason number and the particle-limited regime durability of MR fluids can be very useful to design novel MR fluids or MR devices, as it provides a way to estimate the impact of various design strategies on the total expected life of the device.

TI First-trimester maternal concentrations of polyfluoroalkyl substances
   and fetal growth throughout pregnancy
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Several studies have investigated the possible association between prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and birth anthropometry. However, none has assessed fetal size longitudinally. We studied the possible association between PFASs and fetal biometry.
   Methods: In 1230 mother-child pairs of three cohorts from the Spanish INMA-Project, we analyzed perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in first-trimester maternal plasma (collection: 2003-2008). We measured abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL), biparietal diameter (BPD), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) by ultrasounds at 12, 20, and 34 gestational weeks. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses between log e -transformed (PFASs) and SD-scores of fetal parameters in each cohort and subsequent meta-analysis. We also assessed effect modification by sex and maternal smoking.
   Results: PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA medians were: 0.58, 2.35, 6.05, and 0.65 ng/mL, respectively. There were no associations for the whole population in any trimester of pregnancy. However, we found an indication that maternal smoking modified the effect in different directions depending on the PFAS. Among smokers (31%), we found negative associations between both PFOA and PFNA and FL or EFW at week 20 (% change ranging between - 6.8% and - 5.7% per twofold PFAS increase) and positive associations between PFHxS or PFOS and BPD at week 34 (6.8% and 6.3%, respectively).
   Conclusions: Results did not suggest an overall association between prenatal PFASs and fetal growth. The results among smokers should be taken with caution and further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible role of smoking in this association.

TI PFAS health effects database: Protocol for a systematic evidence map
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) confer waterproof, greaseproof, and non-stick properties when added to consumer products. They are also used for industrial purposes including in aqueous film forming foams for firefighting. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment, are widely detected in human biomonitoring studies, and are of growing regulatory concern across federal, state, and local governments. Regulators, scientists, and citizens need to stay informed on the growing health and toxicology literature related to PFAS.
   Objectives: The goal of this systematic evidence map is to identify and organize the available health and toxicology related literature on a set of 29 PFAS of emerging and growing concern.
   Search and study eligibility: We will search the electronic database PubMed for health or toxicological studies on 29 PFAS of emerging concern.

TI A critical review of the impact of water on cobalt-based catalysts in
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is the catalytic conversion of syngas into several products such as hydrocarbons, oxygenates and H2O. H2O is a key by-product of the FTS process and because a Co based catalyst has a low water-gas shift activity, the concentration of H2O increases with time on stream in FTS. While H2O has a positive influence on C5+ selectivity and a negative impact on CH4 selectivity, for virtually every Co based catalyst, the same cannot be said for the activity of all Co based catalysts, because H2O affects the activity of various Co based catalysts in different ways. Most authors observe a positive H2O effect for SiO2-supported Co catalysts and TiO(2-)supported Co catalysts; however, with gamma-Al2O3-supported Co catalysts, a negative influence of H2O is widely reported. In addition, the impact of H2O on carbon nanofiber-supported Co catalysts is reported in literature to be positive. We propose that the phase of H2O in FTS and the water-affinity and/or resistance behavior of catalyst supports could influence the activity and selectivity of Co-based catalysts and that this could help in explaining the kinetic effect of H2O in FT synthesis.

TI Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics Reveals Occupational Exposure to
   Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Relates to Oxidative Stress, Fatty
   Acid beta-Oxidation Disorder, and Kidney Injury in a Manufactory in
   China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Occupational workers are usually exposed to high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), placing them under greater health risks compared to the general population. Herein, 40 occupational workers from a factory in China and 52 control subjects from the general population were involved in an investigation on the potential health concerns of occupational exposure to PFASs by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis. The PFAS levels in plasma from both groups were analyzed. Six PFAS congeners (Sigma(6)PFASs) were found to be the main components of the 13 detected PFASs, with a geometric mean of 1770 and 22.2 ng mL(-1) in occupational workers and the general population, respectively. Metabolic profiles of the plasma samples were acquired using liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The partial least-squares-discriminant analysis model indicated that the plasma metabolic profiles of the two groups could be clearly separated. Differential and correlation analyses were applied to discover potential biomarkers. A total of 14 potential biomarkers were identified, and they were found to be associated with oxidative stress, fatty acid beta-oxidation disorder, and kidney injury. The obtained results indicated that the health effects of occupational exposure to PFASs on workers should not be ignored.

   Self-Coupling of C8-Methylol Catechin Derivatives
SO SYNTHESIS-STUTTGART
AB A highly efficient and regioselective self-coupling of C8-methylol catechin derivatives is developed for the synthesis of dimeric flavanol analogues under metal-free and mild conditions. Its applicability is showcased by the efficient synthesis of bisflavanol-type natural products bis-8,8 '-catechinylmethane, bis-8,8 '-epicatechinylmethane, talienbisflavan A, and oolonghomobisflavan A. The novel self-coupling mechanism sheds new light on the classical Friedel-Crafts alkylation mechanism in acid-catalyzed catechin-formaldehyde condensation.

TI Targeted metabolome analysis of the dog brain exposed to PCBs suggests
   inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by hydroxylated PCBs
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) possess a high capacity to metabolize higher-chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to thyroid hormone (TH)-like hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs). As a result, the brain could be at high risk of toxicity caused by OH-PCBs. To evaluate the effect of OH-PCBs on dog brain, we analyzed OH-PCB levels in the brain and the metabolome of the frontal cortex following exposure to a mixture of PCBs (CB18, 28, 70, 77, 99, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180, 187, and 202). 4-OH-CB202 and 4-OH-CB107 were major OH-PCBs in the brain of PCB-exposed dogs. These OH-PCBs were associated with metabolites involved in urea cycle, proline-related compounds, and purine, pyrimidine, glutathione, and amino-acid metabolism in dog brain. Moreover, adenosine triphosphate levels in the PCBs exposure group were significantly lower than in the control group. These results suggest that OH-PCB exposure is associated with a disruption in TH homeostasis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and/or disruption of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in brain cells. Among them, OXPHOS disturbance could be associated with both disruptions in cellular amino-acid metabolism and urea cycle. Therefore, an OXPHOS activity assay was performed to evaluate the disruption of OXPHOS by OH-PCBs. The results indicated that 4-OH-CB107 inhibits the function of Complexes III, IV, and V of the electron transport chain, suggesting that 4-OH-CB107 inhibit these complexes in OXPHOS. The neurotoxic effects of PCB exposure may be mediated through mitochondrial toxicity of OH-PCBs in the brain.

TI Interspecies differences in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
   toxicokinetics and application to health-based criteria
SO REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Toxicokinetics are important for extrapolating health effects and effect levels observed in laboratory animals to humans for purposes of establishing health-based criteria. We conducted a comprehensive review of key absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters across different mammalian species for five perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and discussed how these data can be used to inform human health risk assessment of these substances. Our analysis revealed several notable differences among the different PFAS regarding species- and substance-specific tissue partitioning, half-life, and transfer to developing offspring via the placenta or lactation, as well as highlighted data gaps for certain substances. We incorporated these observations in an analysis of whether health-based values for specific PFAS can be applied to other PFAS of differing chain length or toxicological mode of action. Overall, our analysis provides one of the first syntheses of available empirical PFAS toxicokinetic data to facilitate interpreting human relevance of animal study findings and developing health-based criteria for PFAS from such studies.

TI Do Women have Adequate Knowledge about Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions? A
   Systematic Review
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GINECOLOGIA E OBSTETRICIA
AB Objective We sought to investigate whether women present adequate knowledge of the main pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) (urinary incontinence - UI, fecal incontinence - FI, and pelvic organ prolapse - POP).
   Data sources A systematic review was performed in the MEDLINE, PEDro, CENTRAL, and Cochrane databases for publications from inception to April 2018.
   Selection of studies A total of 3,125 studies were reviewed. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of primary outcomes and the diversity of instruments for measuring knowledge. The quality of the articles included in the analysis was evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) adapted for cross-sectional studies.
   Data collection Two authors performed data extraction into a standardized spreadsheet.
   Data synthesis Nineteen studies were included, comprising 11,512 women. About the methodological quality (NOS), most of the studies (n =11) presented a total score of 6 out of 10. Validated questionnaires and designed pilot-tested forms were the most frequently used ways of assessing knowledge. Some studies were stratified by race, age, or group minorities. The most used questionnaire was the prolapse and incontinence knowledge questionnaire (PIKQ) (n = 5). Knowledge and/or awareness regarding PFD was low to moderate among the studies. Urinary incontinence was the most prevalent PFD investigated, and the most important risk factors associated with the lack of knowledge of the pelvic floor were: African-American ethnicity (n = 3), low educational level (n = 4), low access to information (n = 5) and socioeconomic status (n = 3).
   Conclusion Most women have a gap in the knowledge of pelvic floor muscle dysfunctions, do not understand their treatment options, and are not able to identify risk factors for these disorders.

TI Neurodevelopmental and Metabolomic Responses from Prenatal Coexposure to
   Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and Methylmercury (MeHg) in
   Sprague-Dawley Rats
SO CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY
AB Methylmercury (MeHg) and perfluoro-octanesulfonate (PFOS) are major contaminants of human blood that are both common in dietary fish, thereby raising questions about their combined impact on human development. Here, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats ingested a daily dose, from gestational day 1 through to weaning, of either 1 mg/kg bw PFOS (PFOS-only), 1 mg/kg MeHg (MeHg-only), a mixture of 0.1 mg/kg PFOS and 1 mg/kg MeHg (Low-Mix), or of 1 mg/kg of PFOS and 1 mg/kg MeHg (High-Mix). Newborns were monitored for physical milestones and reflexive developmental responses, and in juveniles the spontaneous activity, anxiety, memory, and cognition were assessed. Targeted metabolomics of 199 analytes was applied to sectioned brain regions of juvenile offspring. Newborns in the High-Mix group had decreased weight gain as well as delayed reflexes and innate behavioral responses compared to controls and individual chemical groups indicating a toxicological interaction on early development. In juveniles, cumulative mixture effects increased in a dose-dependent manner in tests of anxiety-like behavior. However, other developmental test results suggested antagonism, as PFOS-only and MeHg-only juveniles had increased hyperactivity and thigmotaxic behavior, respectively, but fewer effects in Low-Mix and High-Mix groups. Consistent with these behavioral observations, a pattern of antagonism was also observed in neurochemicals measured in rat cortex, as PFOS-only and MeHg-only juveniles had altered concentrations of metabolites (e.g., lipids, amino acids, and biogenic amines), while no changes were evident in the combined exposures. The cortical metabolites altered in PFOS-only and MeHg-only exposed groups are involved in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. These proof-of-principle findings at relatively high doses indicate the potential for toxicological interaction between PFOS and MeHg, with developmental-stage specific effects. Future mixture studies at lower doses are warranted, and prospective human birth cohorts should consider possible confounding effects from PFOS and mercury exposure on neurodevelopment.

TI Metabolome Wide Association Study of Serum Poly and Perfluoroalkyl
   Substances (PFASs) in Pregnancy and Early Postpartum
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) profiling of metabolic fingerprints can improve understanding of how poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) induce metabolic alterations of in utero environment and impact fetal health. HRM profiling and quantification of PFASs were performed for 397 maternal perinatal serum samples collected from 1959-1967 in the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS). We used Metabolome-Wide Association Studies (MWAS) and pathway enrichment analysis for metabolic associations with PFOS, its precursor EtFOSAA, and EtFOSAA-to-PFOS ratio. Distinct metabolic profiles were found with EtFOSAA and PFOS. Urea cycle metabolites such as arginine, lysine and creatine had opposite associations with EtFOSAA (negative) and PFOS (positive); whereas, carnitine shuttle metabolites were found to be exclusively and positively associated with PFOS indicating perturbation in fatty acid metabolism. These differential metabolic associations for precursor and end-product represent an important first step in identifying how PFASs alter the in utero environment and potentially leads to disease risk.

TI Bioaccumulation in the gut and liver causes gut barrier dysfunction and
   hepatic metabolism disorder in mice after exposure to low doses of OBS
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The compound sodium rho-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS), a new kind of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compound, is a surfactant for increasing oil production, and it has been widely detected in various organisms. Because of its wide use, OBS is detectable in the environment. However, knowledge about the biological toxicity of OBS to animals is very limited. Here, male mice were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 mu g/L of OBS for 6 weeks via drinking water. It was demonstrated that OBS was highly bioaccumulated both in the liver and gut in the mice after low doses of OBS exposure. Curiously, a low dose of OBS exposure also caused gut barrier dysfunction by decreasing mucus secretion and altering Ionic transport in the gut via the CFTR pathway. In addition, liver function was influenced by OBS at both the histopathological and physiological levels. Hepatic transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis showed a total of 1157 genes, and multiple metabolites changed significantly in the livers of mice exposed to low-dose OBS for 6 weeks. The functions of these changed genes and metabolites are tightly related to glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid transport, and beta-oxidation. All these results indicate that the liver and gut are important target tissues for OBS exposure. Importantly, it is possible that high levels of bioaccumulation of OBS in the gut and liver might directly cause gut barrier dysfunction and hepatic metabolism disorder in mice.

TI Patient satisfaction reporting for patellofemoral arthroplasty is
   significantly lacking: a systematic review
SO PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE
AB Background: Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) has been shown to be successful in restoring knee function and quality of life in patients with the isolated patellofemoral disease. Patient satisfaction has been suggested as an indicator of the quality of elective orthopedic operations, although there remains no standardized method to collect and evaluate satisfaction. The present study offers a systematic review of the available literature concerning patient satisfaction following PFA to assess common methodologies for reporting patient satisfaction. Methods: A query of the Medline database produced 116 articles that were reviewed for inclusion in the review. The following inclusion criteria were used to identify suitable articles: English language, clinical outcomes study related to PFA, and patient-reported satisfaction as an outcome measure. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were eligible for review. The highest level of evidence was level-III. The study publication dates ranged from 2009 to 2016, with six published in 2015 & 2016. In total, 320 PFAs were performed on 267 patients. Four articles reported the proportion of included patients who had previous knee surgeries (range: 20-60%). Three studies used ordinal scales to rate patient satisfaction. Four studies (57.1%) reported the numeric proportion of patients satisfied following PFA, which ranged from 76% to 96.5%. Two studies used Visual Analog Scale methods. For these two studies, one of them reported the mean satisfaction score as 7.5/10, and the other reported a median of 90/100. Conclusions: The available literature on patient satisfaction after PFA was found to be limited, with low-quality evidence and variable methodology.

TI Effects of Maternal Reproductive Investment on Sex-Specific Pollutant
   Accumulation in Seabirds: A Meta-Analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Avian egg production demands resources such as lipids and proteins. Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as C-male/C-female (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level.

SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB Packed red blood cells are a critical component in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock. The availability of donor-derived blood products, however, suffers from issues of supply, immunogenicity, and pathogenic contamination. Deployment in remote or austere environments, such as the battlefield, is further hindered by the inherent perishability of blood products. To address the significant limitations of allogenic packed red blood cells and the urgent medical need for better resuscitative therapies for both combat casualties and civilians, there has been significant research invested in developing safe, effective, and field deployable artificial oxygen carriers. This article provides a comprehensive review of the most important technologies in the field of artificial oxygen carriers including cell-free and encapsulated hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbon emulsions, natural hemoglobin alternatives, as well as other novel technologies. Their development status, clinical, and military relevance are discussed.

Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes like Nafion((R)) and Aquivion((R)) are the state-of-the-art PEMs, but there is a need to increase the operating temperature to improve mass transport, avoid catalyst poisoning and electrode flooding, increase efficiency, and reduce the cost and complexity of the system. However, PSFAs-based membranes exhibit lower mechanical and chemical stability, as well as proton conductivity at lower relative humidities and temperatures above 80 degrees C. One approach to sustain performance is to introduce inorganic fillers and improve water retention due to their hydrophilicity. Alternatively, polymers where protons are not conducted as hydrated H3O+ ions through liquid-like water channels as in the PSFAs, but as free protons (H+) via BrOnsted acid sites on the polymer backbone, can be developed. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) and sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK) are such materials, but need considerable acid doping. Different composites are being investigated to solve some of the accompanying problems and reach sufficient conductivities. Herein, we critically discuss a few representative investigations of composite PEMs and evaluate their significance. Moreover, we present advances in introducing electronic conductivity in the polymer binder in the catalyst layers.

TI Analysis of F-53B, Gen-X, ADONA, and emerging fluoroalkylether
   substances in environmental and biomonitoring samples: A review
SO TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) raise concerns for environmental and human health. This has led to the gradual phase-out from production and commerce of some legacy PFAS. Fluoroalkylether compounds (ether-PFAS) are among the fluorinated alternative chemicals that are beginning to be reported in impacted and background environments. Extensive monitoring activities were conducted since 2015-2019 to bridge knowledge gaps on the environmental fate and effects of ether-PFAS including F-53B (6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate [6:2 Cl-PFAES] and 8:2 Cl-PFAES), Gen-X (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid [HFPO-DA]), and ADONA (dodecafluoro-3H-4,8-dioxanonanoate). In recent years, advances in nontarget screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry have revealed the identities of other infrequently monitored ether-PFAS. In this critical review, we provide an up-to-date inventory of the structures of ether-PFAS discovered in the recent literature. Their environmental occurrence, fate, and effects are discussed on a comparative perspective with some legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Information on the methods employed for the quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis of ether-PFAS is also provided, including sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis, analytical performance, and limitations. In particular, the compiled database of MS/MS fragment ions (n = 111) can be useful in spectrum interpretation of novel ether-PFAS. The concluding remarks open on possible research avenues and the challenges that remain to be addressed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Similar postoperative patient-reported outcome in both second generation
   patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty for treatment of
   isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis: a systematic review
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB IntroductionDue to inconsistent results and high failure rates, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is more often used to treat isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) despite the theoretical advantage of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA). It is perceived that second-generation PFA may have improved the outcomes of surgery. In this systematic review, the primary aim was to compare outcomes of second-generation PFA and TKA by assessment of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).MethodsA systematic search was made in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and MeSH to identify studies using second-generation PFA implants or TKA for treatment of PFOA. Only studies using The American Knee Society (AKSS), The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) or The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to report on PROMs were included.ResultsThe postoperative weighted mean AKSS knee scores were 88.6 in the second-generation PFA group and 91.8 in the TKA group. The postoperative weighted mean AKSS function score was 79.5 in the second-generation PFA group and 86.4 in the TKA group. There was no significant difference in the mean AKSS knee or function scores between the second-generation PFA group and the TKA group. The postoperative weighted mean OKS score was 36.7 and the postoperative weighted mean WOMAC score was 24.4. The revision rate was higher in the second-generation PFA group (113 revisions [8.4%]) than in the TKA group (3 revisions [1.3%]). Progression of OA was most commonly noted as the reason for revision of PFA, and it was noted in 60 cases [53.1%]; this was followed by pain in 33 cases [29.2%].ConclusionExcellent postoperative weighted mean AKSS knee scores were found in both the second-generation PFA group and in the TKA group, suggesting that both surgical options can result in a satisfying patient-reported outcome. Higher revision rates in the second-generation PFA studies may in part be due to challenges related to patient selection. Based on evaluation of PROMs, the use of second-generation PFA seems to be an equal option to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. Hopefully, this can be considered by physicians in their daily clinical work.Level of evidenceIV.

TI Metabolomics of childhood exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances: a
   cross-sectional study
SO METABOLOMICS
AB IntroductionExposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), synthetic and persistent chemicals used in commercial and industrial processes, are associated with cardiometabolic dysfunction and related risk factors including reduced birth weight, excess adiposity, and dyslipidemia. Identifying the metabolic changes induced by PFAS exposure could enhance our understanding of biological pathways underlying PFAS toxicity.ObjectiveTo identify metabolic alterations associated with serum concentrations of four PFAS in children using a metabolome-wide association study.MethodsWe performed untargeted metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, and separately quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) for 114 8-year old children from Cincinnati, OH. We evaluated associations between each serum PFAS concentration and 16,097 metabolic features using linear regression adjusted for child age, sex, and race with a false discovery rate<20%. We annotated PFAS-associated metabolites and conducted pathway enrichment analyses.ResultsSerum PFAS concentrations were associated with metabolic features annotated primarily as lipids and dietary factors. Biological pathways associated with all four PFAS included arginine, proline, aspartate, asparagine, and butanoate metabolism.ConclusionsIn this cross-sectional study, childhood serum PFAS concentrations were correlated with metabolic pathways related to energy production and catabolism. Future studies should determine whether these pathways mediate associations between PFAS exposure and childhood cardiometabolic health.

TI Return to the operating room after patellofemoral arthroplasty versus
   total knee arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral arthritisa
   systematic review
SO INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
AB PurposePatellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are acceptedtreatments for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). However, complications and re-operations have historically differed between the two procedures. We performed a systematic review to report on the re-operation rates between TKA and modern PFA for isolated PFOA.MethodsSystematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA were reviewed. Meta-analysis software was used to screen potential articles with at least one year follow-up that detailed reasons for re-operation. Data was extracted and analyzed for all re-operations. Survival of the implant was used as the primary outcome; return to the operating room (OR) for any reason was used as a secondary outcome.ResultsThe weighted rate of either conversion or revision arthroplasty in the PFA group and the TKA group was 6.34 and 0.11, respectively. The weighted rate of return to the OR for bony and soft tissue procedures was 1.06 and 0.79, respectively. The weighted rate of manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) was 0.32 and 1.23, respectively.ConclusionPatients who undergo PFA may be more likely to return to the operating room for conversion to TKA and/or revision surgery than those who undergo TKA.

TI Microwave-assisted extraction of pharmaceuticals, personal care products
   and industrial contaminants in the environment
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is a well-established automated green extraction technique, offering many advantages such as the combined reduction of the extraction time, solvent and energy consumptions, as well as the possibility of performing simultaneous multiple extractions, thus increasing the number of samples processed daily. This review provides a comprehensive description of the most relevant analytical methods and applications, proposed from year 2012, for the extraction of selected emerging pollutants, including pharmaceuticals and veterinary drugs, personal care products, as well as industrial contaminants, in environmental matrices. The novel developments and last technological trends such as the implementation of organic solvent-free extraction methods, the use of surfactants and ionic liquids, the combination with microextraction approaches or the introduction of systems that sequentially process the samples, are also addressed. Overall, MAE appears to be an excellent alternative for the determination of emerging organic pollutants, thereby enabling its application within the regulatory environmental field.

TI Characterization of the binding of per- and poly-fluorinated substances
   to proteins: A methodological review
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Per- and poly-fluorinated substances (PFASs) are known to have the potential of binding to certain proteins. Protein binding is important to the understanding of cellular toxicities, biotransformation pathways, and the fate of selected PFASs. In this work, we provide a systematic review of major approaches to characterizing PFAS-protein binding, including the techniques based on separation, calorimetry, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, and surfactant nature of PFASs. These approaches enable qualitative and/or quantitative characterization of binding parameters, such as the binding affinity constant and binding stoichiometry. For each approach, we review its principles and evaluate inherent strengths and limitations. In addition, the main methodologies for the identification of binding sites and target proteins are reviewed. Through the integrated review and identification of knowledge gaps and challenges, our work will guide the selection of methodologies for better characterizations of the mechanisms, kinetics, and adverse effects of PFAS-protein binding.

TI Prevalence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes in the
   subtropical mangrove wetland ecosystem of South China Sea
SO MICROBIOLOGYOPEN
AB The emerging pollutants antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are prevalent in aquatic environments such as estuary. Coastal mangrove ecosystems always serve as natural wetlands for receiving sewage which always carry ARGs. Currently, the research considering ARG distribution in mangrove ecosystems gains more interest. In this work, we investigated the diversity of ARGs in an urban estuary containing mangrove and nonmangrove areas of the South China Sea. A total of 163 ARGs that classified into 22 resistance types and six resistance mechanisms were found. ARG abundance of the samples in the estuary is between 0.144 and 0.203. This is within the general range of Chinese estuaries. The difference analysis showed that abundances of total ARGs, six most abundant ARGs (mtrA, rpoB, rpoC, rpsL, ef-Tu, and parY), the most abundant resistance types (elfamycin, multidrug, and peptide), and the most abundant resistance mechanism (target alteration) were significantly lower in mangrove sediment than that in nonmangrove sediment (p < 0.05). Network and partial redundancy analysis showed that sediment properties and mobile genetic elements were the most influential factors impacting ARG distribution rather than microbial community. The two factors collectively explain 51.22% of the differences of ARG distribution. Our study indicated that mangrove sediments have the capacity to remove ARGs. This work provides a research paradigm for analysis of ARG prevalence and proliferation in the subtropical marine coastal mangrove ecosystem.

TI Differential Metabolism of Medium-Chain Fatty Acids in Differentiated
   Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Astrocytes
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diets increase ketone bodies, which are believed to act as alternative energy substrates in the injured brain. Octanoic (C8:0) and decanoic (C10:0) acids, which produce ketone bodies through beta-oxidation, are used as part of MCT ketogenic diets. Although the ketogenic role of MCT is well-established, it remains unclear how the network metabolism underlying beta-oxidation of these medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) differ. We aim to elucidate basal beta-oxidation of these commonly used MCFA at the cellular level. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) astrocytes were incubated with [U-C-13]-C8:0 or [U-C-13]-C10:0, and the fractional enrichments (FE) of the derivatives were used for metabolic flux analysis. Data indicate higher extracellular concentrations and faster secretion rates of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta HB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) with C8:0 than C10:0, and an important contribution from unlabeled substrates. Flux analysis indicates opposite direction of metabolic flux between the MCFA intermediates C6:0 and C8:0, with an important contribution of unlabeled sources to the elongation in the C10:0 condition, suggesting different beta-oxidation pathways. Finally, larger intracellular glutathione concentrations and secretions of 3-OH-C10:0 and C6:0 were measured in C10:0-treated astrocytes. These findings reveal MCFA-specific ketogenic properties. Our results provide insights into designing different MCT-based ketogenic diets to target specific health benefits.

TI Socioeconomic position and exposure to multiple environmental chemical
   contaminants in six European mother-child cohorts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Background: Human exposure to environmental chemical contaminants at critical periods of development can lead to lifelong health consequences. Traditionally, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are thought to experience higher contaminant exposures; however, this relationship may not hold for all contaminants.
   Methods: Using data from six European birth cohorts (1301 mother-child pairs), we determined biomarkers of exposure to 41 contaminants in biological samples from children (6-12 years) and their mothers during pregnancy, including organochlorine compounds (OCs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metals, phthalate metabolites, phenols, and organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites. We analyzed these biomarkers with several socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators (maternal education, employment status and family affluence scale).
   Results: Higher SEP was associated with higher concentrations of several chemicals during pregnancy, including certain PFASs, mercury, arsenic, several phenols, and OP pesticides. Similarly, childhood concentrations of OCs, PFASs, mercury, arsenic, and bisphenol A were higher in higher SEP groups. Conversely, cadmium exposure during pregnancy and exposure to lead and phthalate metabolites in childhood were higher in lower SEP. Principal components representing multiple pollutant exposures showed similar association with SEP.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that environmental chemical contaminant exposure during fetal and childhood life is not exclusively associated to lower SEP and that for several contaminants higher SEP groups incur higher exposure levels.

TI Roflumilast analogs with improved metabolic stability, plasma protein
   binding, and pharmacokinetic profile
SO DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS
AB With the aim of studying their in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics, new chromatographic methods were developed for the determination of three new roflumilast synthetic analogs (I-III) as PDE-4B inhibitors in rat liver S9 fraction, phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and human and rat plasma. The developed high performance liquid chromatography-ultra violet (HPLC-UV) methods were performed on a Zorbax Eclipse C8 column and UV detection was carried out at 215 nm. The three compounds were tested for their metabolic stability and were found to be metabolically more stable than roflumilast especially the 2-mercaptobenzothiazol-6-yl analog (III) which displayed an in vitro half-life time (247.55 minutes) higher than that of roflumilast (12.29 minutes) and a low in vitro clearance of 5.67 mL/min./kg. Possible phase I metabolites were investigated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) showing hydroxylation of the unsubstituted benzothiazol-2-yl (I) and benzothiazole-6-yl (II) analogs and a cleaved benzothiazole metabolite of the 2-mercaptobenzothiazol-6-yl analog (III). Plasma protein binding affinity was tested using equilibrium membrane dialysis method showing a very high percentage (more than 95%) of plasma protein binding of compounds I and II where compound III exhibited lower percentage (53.71%) demonstrating its accessibility for tissue distribution. Also, a UPLC-MS/MS method was developed using an Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP C18 column to be applied to an in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats following a subcutaneous dose (1 mg/kg). Compounds I-III showed improved in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters especially compound III which displayed a half-life 3-fold greater than roflumilast (21 hours) and a C-max value of 113.958 ng/mL. Accordingly, this new chemical entity should be subjected to further investigation as it can be a good drug candidate for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

TI H-1 NMR metabolomic analysis of skin and blubber of bottlenose dolphins
   reveals a functional metabolic dichotomy
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS
AB The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a carnivorous cetacean that thrives in marine environments, one of the apex predators of the marine food web. They are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, which are known to be sensitive to environmental impacts. Dolphins are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems due to their role as predators that can bioaccumulate contaminants. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these mammals, and in the context of pollutants and exposures in the marine environment, skin and blubber are important surface and protective tissues that have not been adequately probed for metabolism. Using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) based metabolomics approach, we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of stranded bottlenose dolphin (n = 4) samples collected at different localities in the Southern Zone coast of Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Results indicate that metabolism of skin and blubber are quantitatively very different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised partial least square regression discriminant analysis (PLSDA). Further, using hierarchical clustering analysis and random forest analysis of the metabolite abundances, the results pointed to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. On one hand, the differential metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, thus pointing to fat synthesis and deposition. On the other hand, the skin showed several metabolites involved in gluconeogenic pathways, pointing towards an active anabolic energy generating metabolism. The most notable pathways found in both tissues included: urea cycle, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism among others. Our H-1 NMR metabolomics analysis allowed the quantification of metabolites associated with these two organs, i.e., pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of the functional and physiological roles of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation, as well as useful target biopsy tissues for monitoring of dolphin health conditions in marine pollution and ecotoxicology studies.

TI A comprehensive review on microbial fuel cell technologies: Processes,
   utilization, and advanced developments in electrodes and membranes
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Microbial fuel cells have gained great interest as an alternative energy conversion system for generating bioenergy. As a bioelectrochemical hybrid system, microbial fuel cells involved in electricity generation and wastewater treatment including nutrients recovery with tremendous benefits such as energy saving, reduced sludge generation and energy conversion. In this review, we mainly emphasize the developments and advancements of electrode and membrane materials for increasing the microbial fuel cell performances in recent years. We reviewed and discussed the different categories of electrode (anode and cathode) materials with various structural, dimensional, compositions and integrations. Moreover, it encloses the cost-effective, biocompatible and highly stable electrode materials with improved microbial fuel cell performance. Using hetero-atom doped 3-Dimensional porous carbon with ultra-fine metal nanoparticles, a large surface area of the electrode material with different dimensional, and new core@shell structure can considerably enhance the oxygen reduction reaction performance during the microbial fuel cell operation. Following this overview, development in membrane materials such as perfluorinated polymer, hydrocarbon polymer, organic-organic hybrid polymer, organic inorganic hybrid composite, ceramics, and biopolymer membranes are explained in detail. Based on the physical, chemical, mechanical and biocompatible properties, the hybrid composite biopolymer membrane with organic and inorganic additives are recommended as a suitable membrane candidate for increasing the ion conductivity and rectifying the biofouling issues during the long term operation. Finally, the future viewpoints in the microbial fuel cell for effective wastewater treatment process with electricity generation are suggested through various aspects and strategies to afford clean energy and environment.

TI Optimized Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry for 1,1
   '-sulfonylbis[2-(methylthio)ethane] Quantification in Human Urine
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHIC SCIENCE
AB Sulfur mustard (SM) which is a bifunctional alkylating vesicant is one of the mostly used chemical warfare agent in First World War and the Iran-Iraq War. beta-Lyase metabolites of SM especially 1,1'sulfonylbis[2-(methylthio) ethane] (SBMTE) is an unequivocal biomarker of the exposure. An optimized gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the retrospective detection of SBMTE in human urine. Urine samples were treated with acidic titanium trichloride to reduce beta-lyase metabolites to the single analyte SBMTE. After neutralization and precipitation, SBMTE was extracted from urine by C8 solid-phase extraction cartridge and analyzed in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/mL with relative standard deviation of < 10%. Acceptable intra-day and inter-day precisions and accuracies were obtained. The developed method was successfully measured various levels of SBMTE which could be used as the forensic evidence of such a chemical attack.

TI Physiology-based toxicokinetic modelling in the frame of the European
   Human Biomonitoring Initiative
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Given the opportunities provided by internal dosimetry modelling in the interpretation of human biomonitoring (HBM) data, the assessment of the links between exposure to chemicals and observed HBM data can be effectively supported by PBTK modelling. This paper gives a comprehensive review of available human PBTK models for compounds selected as a priority by the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). We highlight their advantages and deficiencies and suggest steps for advanced internal dose modelling. The review of the available PBTK models highlighted the conceptual differences between older models compared to the ones developed recently, reflecting commensurate differences in research questions. Due to the lack of coordinated strategies for deriving useful biomonitoring data for toxicokinetic properties, significant problems in model parameterisation still remain; these are further increased by the lack of human toxicokinetic data due to ethics issues.
   Finally, questions arise as well as to the extent they are really representative of interindividual variability. QSARs for toxicokinetic properties is a complementary approach for PBTK model parameterisation, especially for data poor chemicals. This approach could be expanded to model chemico-biological interactions such as intestinal absorption and renal clearance; this could serve the development of more complex generic PBTK models that could be applied to newly derived chemicals.
   Another gap identified is the framework for mixture interaction terms among compounds that could eventually interact in metabolism. From the review it was concluded that efforts should be shifted toward the development of generic multi-compartmental and multi-route models, supported by targeted biomonitoring coupled with parameterisation by both QSAR approach and experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) data for newly developed and data poor compounds.

TI Trace metals and persistent organic pollutants contamination in batoids
   (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea): A systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and Sigma PCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution.

TI Artificial Oxygen Carriers-Past, Present, and Future-a Review of the
   Most Innovative and Clinically Relevant Concepts
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS
AB Blood transfusions are a daily practice in hospitals. Since these products are limited in availability and have various, harmful side effects, researchers have pursued the goal to develop artificial blood components for about 40 years. Development of oxygen therapeutics and stem cells are more recent goals. Medline (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?holding=ideudelib), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov), EU Clinical Trials Register (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu), and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.anzctr.org.au) were searched up to July 2018 using search terms related to artificial blood products in order to identify new and ongoing research over the last 5 years. However, for products that are already well known and important to or relevant in gaining a better understanding of this field of research, the reader is punctually referred to some important articles published over 5 years ago. This review includes not only clinically relevant substances such as heme-oxygenating carriers, perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers, stem cells, and organ conservation, but also includes interesting preclinically advanced compounds depicting the pipeline of potential new products. In-depth insights into specific benefits and limitations of each substance, including the biochemical and physiologic background are included. "Fancy" ideas such as iron-based substances, O-2 microbubbles, cyclo-dextranes, or lugworms are also elucidated. To conclude, this systematic up-to-date review includes all actual achievements and ongoing clinical trials in the field of artificial blood products to pursue the dream of artificial oxygen carrier supply. Research is on the right track, but the task is demanding and challenging.

TI Emerging pollutants in the urban water cycle in Latin America: A review
   of the current literature
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Emerging pollutants (EP) are increasingly studied and characterized worldwide to improve the understanding of their environmental and toxicological impacts and their occurrence and behaviors in different environmental systems. Latin America has been subject to both environmental and toxicological impacts due to EP. To better understand these impacts, studies concerning pollutants have increased for the last ten years. The current study presents a critical review on the occurrence of different emerging pollutants in various components of the urban water cycle (UWC) in Latin America. The review is based on studies performed in 11 different countries between 1999 and 2018. The countries where the higher number of investigations were conducted are Brazil (53%) and Mexico (15%). The EP most often studied within the literature are pharmaceuticals, followed by personal care products. The most common EP reported were 17 beta-estradiol, bisphenol A and estrone; The UWC component with the greatest number of measurements in the reported studies were effluents from wastewater treatment plants.

TI Assessing the human health risks of perfluorooctane sulfonate by in vivo
   and in vitro studies
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The wide use of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has led to increasing concern about its human health risks over the past decade. In vivo and in vitro studies are important and effective means to ascertain the toxic effects of PFOS on humans and its toxic mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the human health risks of PFOS based on the currently known facts found by in vivo and in vitro studies from 2008 to 2018. Exposure to PFOS has caused hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, thyroid disruption, cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and renal toxicity in laboratory animals and many in vitro human systems. These results and related epidemiological studies confirmed the human health risks of PFOS, especially for exposure via food and drinking water. Oxidative stress and physiological process disruption based on fatty acid similarity were widely studied mechanisms of PFOS toxicity. Future research for assessing the human health risks of PFOS is recommended in the chronic toxicity and molecular mechanisms, the application of various omics, and the integration of toxicological and epidemiological data.

TI Selectivity evaluation of phenyl based stationary phases for the
   analysis of amino acid diastereomers by liquid chromatography coupled
   with mass spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB D-amino acids (AA) analysis is becoming more and more relevant for metabolomics, therefore new analytical tools need to be developed. A common approach to achieve AA enantioseparation is chiral derivatization. Among the chiral derivatization reagents, (+) or (-)-1-(9-fluorenyl) ethyl chloroformate ((+) or (-)-FLEC) has proved to be one of the most versatile. Suitable chiral selectivity for FLEC derivatives of amino acids could be obtained in reversed-phase HPLC using nonpolar stationary phases (C4, C8 and C18) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) based mobile phases. This study is meant to provide alternatives to the use of THF as organic modifier by evaluating the selectivity obtained on two phenyl based stationary phases for 19 FLEC-DL-AA pairs of diastereomers using UHPLC-MS. Several mobile phases consisting of ammonium acetate and different common organic solvents (acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH), 2-propanol (IPA)) were tested using gradient elution. Experimental design was employed for the optimization of the separation conditions. In the optimized conditions, complete chiral separation can be achieved for 18 out of 19 FLEC-DL-AAs in less than 30 min. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Perfluorohexanoic acid toxicity, part II: Application of human health
   toxicity value for risk characterization
SO REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon PFAA and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used in the United States, Europe and Japan today. With the shift towards short-chain PFAA chemistry, uncertainties remain regarding human health risks associated with current exposure levels. Here, we present a critical review and assessment of data relevant to human health risk assessment to today's short-chain PFAA chemistry. Human biomonitoring surveys indicate that PFHxA is infrequently detected in the environment as well as in human serum and urine; however, human health concerns may persist in locations where PFHxA is detected. In a companion paper (Luz et al., 2019) we comprehensively evaluate the available toxicity data for PFHxA, and derive a chronic human health-based reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day based on benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis in chronically exposed female rats. In this paper, we apply this RID in human health-based screening levels calculations, and derive a drinking water lifetime health advisory of 1400 mu g/L and a residential groundwater screening level for children of 4000 mu g/L. Compared to environmental concentration data, even sites with more elevated concentrations of PFHxA in the environment are at least an order of magnitude lower than these screening levels. Available PFHxA human serum and urine biomonitoring data, used as a biomarker for general population exposure, demonstrates that the general human population exposures to PFHxA are low. Previous estimates of daily intake rates for infants exposed to PFHxA through breast milk, formula, and baby foods (Lorenzo et al., 2016) combined with the most conservative PFHxA peer-reviewed toxicity value (Luz et al., 2019) demonstrate that the margin of safety for PFHxA is high. Therefore, PFHxA and related fluorotelomer precursors currently appear to present negligible human health risk to the general population and are not likely to drive or substantially contribute to risk at sites contaminated with PFAS mixtures. PFHxA may also represent a suitable marker for the safety of fluorotelomer replacement chemistry used today.

TI Perfluorohexanoic acid toxicity, part I: Development of a chronic human
   health toxicity value for use in risk assessment
SO REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain, six-carbon perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and is a primary impurity, degradant, and metabolite associated with the short-chain fluorotelomer-based chemistry used globally today. The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This ROD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA. The analyses presented support site specific risk assessments as well as product stewardship initiatives for current and future short-chain fluorotelomer-based products.

TI The overlooked short- and ultrashort-chain poly- and perfluorinated
   substances: A review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFAS) comprise more than 3000 individual compounds; nevertheless, most studies to date have focused mainly on the fate, transport and remediation of long-chain PFAS (C>7). The main objective of this article is to provide the first critical review of the peer reviewed studies on the analytical methods, occurrence, mobility, and treatment for ultra-short-chain PFAS (C = 2-3) and short-chain PFAS (C=4-7). Previous studies frequently detected ultra-short-chain and short-chain PFAS in various types of aqueous environments including seas, oceans, rivers, surface/urban runoffs, drinking waters, groundwaters, rain/snow, and deep polar seas. Besides, the recent regulations and restrictions on the use of long-chain PFAS has resulted in a significant shift in the industry towards short-chain alternatives. However, our understanding of the environmental fate and remediation of these ultra-short-chain and short-chain PFAS is still fragmentary. We have also covered the handful studies involving the removal of ultra-short and short-chain PFAS and identified the future research needs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI HaloSeeker 1.0: A User-Friendly Software to Highlight Halogenated
   Chemicals in Nontargeted High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Data Sets
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In the present work, we address the issue of nontargeted screening of organohalogenated chemicals in complex matrixes. A global strategy aiming to seek halogenated signatures in full-scan high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) fingerprints was developed. The resulting all-in-one user-friendly application, HaloSeeker 1.0, was developed to promote the accessibility of associated in-house bioinformatics tools to a large audience. The ergonomic web user interface avoids any interactions with the coding component while allowing interactions with the data, including peak detection (features), deconvolution, and comprehensive accompanying manual review for chemical formula assignment. HaloSeeker 1.0 was successfully applied to a marine sediment HRMS data set acquired on a liquid chromatography heated electrospray ionization [LC-HESI(-)] Orbitrap instrument (R = 140 000 at m/z 200). Among the 4532 detected features, 827 were paired and filtered in 165 polyhalogenated clusters. HaloSeeker was also compared to three similar tools and showed the best performances. HaloSeeker's ability to filter and investigate halogenated signals was demonstrated and illustrated by a potential homologue series with C12HxBryClzO2 as a putative general formula.

TI Brachial plexus neuropathy by hibernoma compression: An unusual
   presentation of peripheral non-neural sheath nerve tumor and a
   systematic review of literature
SO NEUROLOGY INDIA
AB Brachial plexus neuropathies are uncommon and are rarely caused by a tumor. The clinical presentation of a brachial plexus neuropathy caused by a tumor depends on the degree of malignancy of the tumor and its localization. We report an illustrative case of a 27-year old female subject with a progressively increasing mass lesion causing brachial plexus compression, ipsilateral shoulder pain, C8 dermatomal paresthesia, and impairment of motor power. The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass and neurolysis of the nerves in the vicinity. Following the surgical procedure, the patient had improvement in the pain and paresthesia that he was suffering from. The histopathological diagnosis revealed a hibernoma, an extremely rare tumor described only once previously in this location. A systematic review of the literature was performed utilizing the PubMed database to access articles published before March 2018, using: A -the term 'hibernoma' in the title/abstract associated with the following MeSH terms: brachial plexus neuropathies OR brachial plexus neuropathy OR nerve compression syndrome, OR brachial plexus; B -the MeSH term 'brachial plexus' associated with the term 'non neural sheath nerve tumor' or 'peripheral non-neural sheath nerve tumor'. The origin of the hibernoma, as well as its metabolic influence, pathology, and treatment have been discussed.

TI Removal of antibiotics from aqueous solutions by nanoparticles: a
   systematic review and meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Antibiotics, as one of the emerging pollutants, are non-biodegradable compounds and long-term exposure to them may affect endocrine, hormonal, and genetic systems of human beings, representing a potential risk for both the environment and human health. The presence of antibiotics in surface waters and drinking water causes a global health concern. Many researches have stated that conventional methods used for wastewater treatment cannot fully remove antibiotic residues, and they may be detected in receiving waters. It is reported that nanoparticles could remove these compounds even at low concentration and under varied conditions of pH. The current study aimed to review the most relevant publications reporting the use of different nanoparticles to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions. Moreover, meta-analysis was conducted on the results of some articles. Results of meta-analysis proved that different nanoparticles could remove antibiotics with an acceptable efficiency of 61%. Finally, this review revealed that nanoparticles are promising and efficient materials for degradation and removal of antibiotics from water and wastewater solutions. Furthermore, future perspectives of the new generation nanostructure adsorbents were discussed in this study.

TI SINGLE- VERSUS DOUBLE-INTEGRATED SCREWS IN INTRAMEDULLARY NAILING
   SYSTEMS FOR SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF EXTRACAPSULAR HIP FRACTURES IN THE
   ELDERLY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS
AB Approximately 50% of all hip fractures are extracapsular and typically treated with extramedullary or intramedullary fixation. Modern intramedullary nails used for internal fixation of extracapsular fractures are generally cephalomedullary nails secured by at least one cephalic screw. Different designs have been developed, varying in length, diameter, neck shaft angle, number of cephalic screws or blades, ability to slide and/or compress, ability to control rotation, construction materials and insertion-point. Articles published in all languages up to January 2019, are listed in PubMed and Scopus electronic databases about the association between the number of cephalic screws and the rate of complications and functional outcome. Twenty articles were included following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Sliding hip screws (SHS) were the standard of care for hip fractures from the 1950s to the 1990s, but presently intramedullary nails are more commonly used. There has been a more than 20-fold relative increase in the utilization of intramedullary nails since 1999. With the emergence of value-based healthcare, there is a growing interest of how best to provide high-quality care in a clinical and cost-effective manner, acknowledging limited healthcare budgets. The present systematic review assessed the long-term outcomes of the most commonly used nails using double cephalic screws compared with single screw devices in patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The development of new technologies may allow a lower incidence of complications, a reduction in operative time and a lower intraoperative blood loss.

TI Environmental applications of solid-phase microextraction
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Solid-phase microextraction is a well-established green solvent free extraction technique with a large number of applications in different fields such as food, forensic, biomedical, and the environment. The present review comprehensively describes the most recent applications mostly reported from 2013 of SPME for the extraction of environmental pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), pesticides, and emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), in different environmental matrices. This review also covers the last technological developments including the use of novel extraction coatings (MOFs, CNTs, ILs), formats (e.g. TFSE), approaches (e.g. vacuum, cold fiber, and in-tube SPME), and on-site devices. The hyphenation of SPME with other techniques, especially mass spectrometry will be described, as well. The usefulness of SPME to follow (photo)degradation studies, both in target and non-target analysis, as well as to determine some of the physicochemical parameters governing the pollutant fate in the environment is also illustrated through different examples.

TI Mapping Salmonella typhimurium pathways using C-13 metabolic flux
   analysis
SO METABOLIC ENGINEERING
AB In the last years, Salmonella has been extensively studied not only due to its importance as a pathogen, but also as a host to produce pharmaceutical compounds. However, the full exploitation of Salmonella as a platform for bioproduct delivery has been hampered by the lack of information about its metabolism. Genome-scale metabolic models can be valuable tools to delineate metabolic engineering strategies as long as they closely represent the actual metabolism of the target organism. In the present study, a C-13-MFA approach was applied to map the fluxes at the central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 growing at glucose-limited chemostat cultures. The experiments were carried out in a 2L bioreactor, using defined medium enriched with 20% C-13-labeled glucose. Metabolic flux distributions in central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 were estimated using OpenFLUX2 based on the labeling pattern of biomass protein hydrolysates together with biomass composition. The results suggested that pentose phosphate is used to catabolize glucose, with minor fluxes through glycolysis. In silico simulations, using Optflux and pFBA as simulation method, allowed to study the performance of the genome-scale metabolic model. In general, the accuracy of in silico simulations was improved by the superimposition of estimated intracellular fluxes to the existing genome-scale metabolic model, showing a better fitting to the experimental extracellular fluxes, whereas the intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate and anaplerotic reactions were poorly described.

TI Occurrence and levels of micropollutants across environmental and
   engineered compartments in Austria
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Occurrence and concentration of a broad spectrum of micropollutants are investigated in Austrian river catchments, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organotin compounds, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and metals. The parallel analysis across multiple environmental and engineered compartments sheds light on the ratio of dissolved and particulate transport and on differences in concentration levels between point and diffuse emission pathways. It is found that some PAHs and organotins are present in rivers, groundwater and bulk deposition at higher concentrations than in municipal wastewater effluents. Among PFAAs and metals, highest concentrations were recorded either in atmospheric deposition or in discharges from wastewater treatment plants. The relevance of the analysis across compartments is best shown by the case of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Despite municipal wastewater effluents being the emission pathway with highest concentrations, this study reveals that not only rivers, but also atmospheric deposition and groundwater sometimes exceed the environmental quality standard for surface waters. Moreover, this work reveals partially counterintuitive patterns. In rivers with treated wastewater discharges, increasing levels of dissolved compounds were measured at rising flow conditions, whereas the opposite would be expected owing to the dilution effect. This might derive from the mobilisation from soil or suspended particulate matter or rather find its explanation in high concentrations in atmospheric deposition. These hypotheses require however being tested through targeted studies. Additional future research includes the analysis of how regional or catchment specific characteristics might alter the relative importance of different emission pathways, and the modelling of emission and river loads to assess their relative contribution to river pollution.

TI Perfluoropolymer/Molecular Sieve Mixed-Matrix Membranes
SO MEMBRANES
AB Despite the outstanding chemical, thermal and transport properties of amorphous and glassy perfluorinated polymers, only few works exist on the preparation and transport properties of perfluoropolymer/molecular sieves mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs), probably because of their poor compatibility. In this review, the compatibilization of ceramic molecular sieves with perfluorinated matrices is considered first, examining the effect of the surface treatment on the gas transport properties of the filler. Then the preparation of the defect-free hybrid membranes and their gas separation capabilities are described. Finally, recent modelling of the gas transport properties of the perfluoropolymer MMMs is reviewed. The systematic use of molecular sieves of different size and shape, either permeable or impermeable, and the calculation of the bulk transport properties of the molecular sieves-i.e., the unrestricted diffusion and permeability-allow to understand the nature of the physical phenomena at work in the MMMs, that is the larger the perfluoropolymer fractional free volume at the interface, and restricted diffusion at the molecular sieves. This knowledge led to the formulation of a new four-phase approach for the modelling of gas transport. The four-phase approach was implemented in the frame of the Maxwell model and also for the finite element simulation. The four-phase approach is a convenient representation of the transport in MMMs when more than one single interfacial effect is present.

TI Removal of poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances from aqueous systems by
   nano-enabled water treatment strategies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Exceptional properties at the nano-scale, if appropriately harnessed, will lead to innovations in water treatment. Nanomaterials can enable treatment processes with accelerated reaction kinetics, self-healing or self-regeneration abilities, and a high degree of selectivity for targeted pollutant removal. These materials can also introduce new pathways for the removal of contaminants that are challenging to degrade employing traditional techniques. One such class of contaminants is poly-and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are widely detected in waterways of the U.S. and drinking water supplies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed two PFAS (i.e., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid or PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA) in the Contaminant Candidate List and recently has revised the lifetime health advisories. PFAS molecules are persistent in the environment over long periods because they are not photolyzed or biodegraded. Current mitigation technologies mostly depend on non-destructive phase transfer processes (e.g., adsorption, filtration, or ion exchange) which results in a concentrated waste stream. Few destructive mitigation methods transform PFAS by cleaving C-C bonds but it is not clear if the transformation products (e.g., shorter chain PFAS) are less toxic or less persistent. Thus, the central challenge for PFAS transformation lies in cleaving the strong C-F bonds. Nanomaterials can enable treatment options by providing high-energy reaction pathways; e.g., electrolysis, thermolysis, or photolysis. This perspective aims to present a critical review on reported PFAS removal/destruction techniques, provide molecular-level insights into possible removal/destruction pathways, and propose potential nano-enabled remediation options for these persistent contaminants.

TI Spectral mapping methods applied to LiDAR data: Application to fuel type
   mapping
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Originally developed to classify multispectral and hyperspectral images, spectral mapping methods were used to classify Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate the vertical structure of vegetation for Fuel Type (FT) mapping. Three spectral mapping methods generated spatially comprehensive FT maps for Caballeros National Park (Spain): (1) Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), (2) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and (3) Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). The Vegetation Vertical Profiles (VVPs) describe the vertical distribution of the vegetation and are used to define each FT endmember in a LiDAR signature library. Two different approaches were used to define the endmembers, one based on the field data collected in 1998 and 1999 (Approach 1) and the other on exploring spatial patterns of the singular FT discriminating factors (Approach 2). The overall accuracy is higher for Approach 2 and with best results when considering a five-FT model rather than a seven-FT model. The agreement with field data of 44% for MESMA and SMA and 40% for SAM is higher than the 38% of the official Caballeros National Park FTs map. The principal spatial patterns for the different FTs were well captured, demonstrating the value of this novel approach using spectral mapping methods applied to LiDAR data. The error sources included the time gap between field data and LiDAR acquisition, the steep topography in parts of the study site, and the low LiDAR point density among others.

TI Removal of Pharmaceutical Contaminants in Wastewater Using
   Nanomaterials: A Comprehensive Review
SO CURRENT DRUG METABOLISM
AB Background: The limitless presence of pharmaceutical contaminants in discharged wastewater has emerged as a threat to aquatic species and humans. Their presence in drinking water has although raised substantial concerns, very little is known about the fate and ecological impacts of these pollutants. As a result, these pollutants are inevitably introduced to our food chain at trace concentrations. Unfortunately, the conventional wastewater treatment techniques are unable to treat pharmaceuticals completely with practical limitations. The focus has now been shifted towards nanotechnology for the successful remediation of these persistent pollutants. Thus, the current review specifically focuses on providing readers brief yet sharp insights into applications of various nanomaterials for the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants.
   Methods: An exhaustive collection of bibliographic database was done with articles having high impact and citations in relevant research domains. An in-depth analysis of screened papers was done through standard tools. Studies were categorized according to the use of nanoscale materials as nano-adsorbents (graphene, carbon nanotubes), nanophotocatalysts (metal, metal oxide), nano-filtration, and ozonation for promising alternative technologies for the efficient removal of recalcitrant contaminants.
   Results: A total of 365 research articles were selected. The contemporary advancements in the field of nanomaterials for drinking and wastewater treatment have been thoroughly analyzed along with their future perspectives.
   Conclusion: The recommendations provided in this article will be useful to adopt novel strategies for on-site removal of the emerging contaminants in pharmaceutical effluents and related industries.

TI HEAVY METAL CONTENT IN PLASTIC CHILDREN TOYS
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB In the children toys market, manufacturers are struggling to make the most profits, offering different products, some of which are of questionable quality and pose a potential danger to the health of children. The aim of the paper was to determine the content of heavy metals: cadmium, lead, zinc, iron and cobalt in coloured plastic toys. Another aim was to compare the concentration of these heavy metals in toys manufactured in China and the EU. Samples were prepared by wet digestion in the microwave oven Anton Paar Multiwave 3000. The sample was discharged in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in Teflon vessels in a ratio of 1 ml H2O2 and 6 ml HNO3. The measurement was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry by flame technique, on the instrument 'Perkin Elmer' Analyst-800 with Zeeman correction. Six different types of children toys were analysed. The largest measured concentration for Cd was in sample 1 and it was 0.9 mu g/kg, while in samples 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Cd concentrations were below instrument detection for said heavy metal. The Pb content in all samples was below the limit of detection of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest concentration of Co was in sample number 3 and it amounted to 5.6 mu g/kg while in the sample 2 the value was 3.5 mu g/kg. The content of Zn in sample 2 was 213.7 mu g/kg, while the other values were slightly lower. The lowest Fe concentration value was in sample number 1 from 6.8 mu g/kg and the highest 617.7 mu g/kg in the sample 5. The concentrations of all the analysed heavy metals in the scabbard parts from the toy for children were within the permissible concentration limits that have been prescribed by Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys, and therefore these toys do not pose a risk to children health. Also, there were no major rejections of heavy metal concentrations in children toys, regardless of the origin of production (China or the EU).

AB As an important part of environmental protection, domestic sewage treatment is inseparable from our daily life. With the increasing public attention to it, domestic sewage treatment technology needs to be constantly optimized to meet the public demand. This paper will focus on the main components of domestic sewage, including pathogens, persistence organic pollutants, and heavy metal pollutants and emerging pollutants. At the same time, this paper will also introduce the corresponding treatment methods for different pollutants. Treatment methods will be divided into traditional and emerging technologies (except emerging pollutants, which have a short history of discovery) for comparison and evaluation. For emerging pollutants, this paper will separately introduce its detection methods, as well as treatment methods in the experimental stage.

AB The causes of neurodegenerative disorders are largely unknown. Environmental factors seem to contribute to neurodegeneration in genetically susceptible individuals. Increasing evidence point towards a key role for environmental exposure in the causation of neurodegenerative disorders and specifically for metal exposure. Alterations of metalloproteins seem to be a common motif in neurodegeneration and enough evidence has now accumulated to designate these disorders as metallopathies. Paired sampling refers to the simultaneous sampling of CSF and blood and by comparing metal concentrations between CSF and blood conclusions about exposure and barrier properties can be drawn. However previous reports on metal concentrations in body fluids in neurodegenerative disorders show a wide variation in results hampering firm conclusions on the role of metals in degeneration of nerve cells. Here we suggest some steps and measures to minimise this variation, most important sampling performed in a cleanroom with filtered air and the use of acid washed perfluoroalkoxy vials. By strict adherence to ultraclean paired sampling technique conclusive results concerning the role of metals in neurodegenerative disorders can be generated.

TI Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) versus Perfluoropropane (C3F8) in the
   Intraoperative Management of Macular Holes: A Systematic Review and
   Meta-Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify and review studies comparing SF6 to C3F8 as a tamponade agent in the intraoperative management of macular holes. Methods. Publications up to October 2018 that focused on macular hole surgery in terms of primary closure, complications, and clinical outcomes were included. Forest plots were created using a weighted summary of proportion meta-analysis. Analysis was performed separately for SF6 and C3F8. A random effects model was used, and corresponding I-2 heterogeneity estimates were calculated. Results. Nine pertinent publications studying a total of 4,715 patients were identified in 2000 to 2017, including two randomized studies (n=206), two prospective studies (n=170), and five retrospective or registry-based studies. Similar rates of closure between SF6 and C3F8 were reported in eight out of nine studies, regardless of subgroup analyses. All studies reporting visual outcomes showed similar results when comparing SF6 to C3F8 at one to six months of follow-up. Neither agent was clearly associated with increased risk of ocular hypertension, cataract formation, or other adverse events. Meta-analytic pooling of the closure rates in the SF6 group resulted in 91.73% (95% confidence interval: 88.40 to 94.55, I-2: 38.03%), and for C3F8, the closure rate was 88.36% (95% confidence interval: 85.88 to 90.63, I-2: 0.0%). Conclusions. Both SF6 and C3F8 appear to have achieved similar visual outcomes and primary closure rates and neither was associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Considering the more rapid visual recovery with SF6, there appears to be no evidence to support C3F8 as the tamponade agent of choice for macular hole surgery.

TI Thermal Compatibility Between Perfluoroisobutyronitrile-CO2 Gas Mixture
   With Coder and Aluminum Switchgear
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Perfluoroisobutyronitrile (C4F7N) has received extensive attention over the past three years as an environmental friendly gas insulating medium. At present, there are few studies on the compatibility of C4F7N with metal materials used in the electrical equipment. In this paper, we constructed a gas-solid interfacial reaction platform and carried out aging tests for C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture at different temperatures. The composition of the gas mixture and the surface morphology and the elemental composition of copper, aluminum were explored. The interaction mechanism between C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture and metal surface was also analyzed. It was found that C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture has better compatibility with aluminum than copper. The reaction between C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture and heated copper at 220 degrees C produces the gaseous by-product C3F6. The surface color of copper deepens and the corrosive degree increases with temperature, while the interaction between C4F7N and heated aluminum does not cause gas decomposition and metal corrosion. In general, the thermal stability of C4F7N-CO2 gas mixture associated with heated copper and aluminum is inferior to that of SF6.

TI Exposure to Perfluoroalkyl Substances during Fetal Life and Pubertal
   Development in Boys and Girls from the Danish National Birth Cohort
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: It remains unsettled whether prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) affects human reproductive health through potential endocrine disruption.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the associations between prenatal exposure to several PFASs and various aspects of pubertal development boys and girls.
   METHODS: We studied two samples (n = 722 and 445) hum the Puberty Cohort, nested within the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), measuring PEAS in maternal plasma hum early gestation. Data on pubertal development were collected biannually from the age of 11 y until full maturation, using web-based questionnaires. Outcomes were age at menarche, voice break, first ejaculation, and Tanner stages 2 to 5 for pubic hair, breast, genital development, and a combined puberty indicator. A regression model for censored data was used to estimate mean difference (months) in age at achieving the pubertal outcomes across tertiles of PEAS concentrations and with a doubling of PFAS concentrations (continuous). For perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a meta-analysis was used to provide a weighted average of the point estimates from samples 1 and 2.
   RESULTS: Overall, prenatal exposure to PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PDFA) (girls) and PFHxS and PFHpS (boys) was associated with lower mean age at puberty marker onset. PFDA and PFNA exposure was associated with higher mean age at onset of puberty in boys. Nonmonotonic associations in girls (PFOS, PFHpS, PFDA) and boys (PFDA, PFNA) were observed, showing larger mean age differences for the combined puberty indicator in the middle tertile [girls: PFOS: -3.73 mo, 95% confidence interval (CI): -6.59, -0.87; PFHpS: -4.92 mo, 95% CI: -11.68, 1.85; PFDA: -3.60 mo, 95% CI: -9.03, 1.83; and boys: PFNA: 4.45 mo, 95% CL -1.30, 10.2E PFDA: 4.59 mo, 95% CL -0.93, 10.11] than in the highest tertile with the lowest as reference.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based cohort study suggests sex-specific associations of altered pubertal development with prenatal exposure to PFASs. These findings are novel, and replication is needed.

TI Partitioning of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances from soil to
   groundwater within aqueous film-forming foam source zones
SO JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY
AB Metadata from on-going site investigations at U.S. Air Force sites impacted by Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) were used to evaluate primary factors that affect transport of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within source zones. Soil-to-groundwater ratios (gamma(Soll-Gw)) were calculated for each site and PFAS as an empirical transport metric and regressed against select soil chemical and physical properties, as well as relevant interactions thereof, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Total organic carbon and percent total clay content were significant covariates and best fit log-transformed gamma(Soll-Gw) with a parallel lines model. Regression parameters were used to derive apparent K-OC estimates for 15 perfluoroalkyl acids, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and the 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonates, which were bimodal where significant differences were primarily observed between PFAS with fewer than 8 perfluorinated carbons (including perfluorooctoanoic acid; PFOA) and those with 8 or more (including perfluorooctane sulfonate; PFOS). Surprisingly, clay content was observed with a negative slope (i.e.,gamma(Soll-Gw) decreased with increasing clay content), which may reflect greater retardation at more permeable sites due to air-water interfacial partitioning. Further analysis demonstrated that gamma(Soll-Gw) is also affected by the degree of flushing in a way that suggests mass transfer (as opposed to hysteretic desorption) primarily controls mass discharge at poorly flushed sites. Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrates that PFAS retention in soil is significant, but depends on a combination of fundamental partitioning mechanisms that may not be predictable in all cases based on transport models that assume an equilibrium condition.

TI Critical review: Grand challenges in assessing the adverse effects of
   contaminants of emerging concern on aquatic food webs
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Much progress has been made in the past few decades in understanding the sources, transport, fate, and biological effects of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic ecosystems. Despite these advancements, significant obstacles still prevent comprehensive assessments of the environmental risks associated with the presence of CECs. Many of these obstacles center around the extrapolation of effects of single chemicals observed in the laboratory or effects found in individual organisms or species in the field to impacts of multiple stressors on aquatic food webs. In the present review, we identify 5 challenges that must be addressed to promote studies of CECs from singular exposure events to multispecies aquatic food web interactions. There needs to be: 1) more detailed information on the complexity of mixtures of CECs in the aquatic environment, 2) a greater understanding of the sublethal effects of CECs on a wide range of aquatic organisms, 3) an ascertaining of the biological consequences of variable duration CEC exposures within and across generations in aquatic species, 4) a linkage of multiple stressors with CEC exposure in aquatic systems, and 5) a documenting of the trophic consequences of CEC exposure across aquatic food webs. We examine the current literature to show how these challenges can be addressed to fill knowledge gaps. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:46-60. (c) 2018 SETAC

TI Peroxidases-assisted removal of environmentally-related hazardous
   pollutants with reference to the reaction mechanisms of industrial dyes
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Environmental protection is one of the most important challenges for the humankind. Increasing number of emerging pollutants resulting from industrial/human-made activities represents a serious menace to the ecological and environmental equilibrium. Industrial dyes, endocrine disrupters, pesticides, phenols and halogenated phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other xenobiotics are among the top priority environmental pollutants. Some classical remediation approaches including physical, chemical and biological are being employed, but are ineffective in cleaning the environment. Enzyme-catalyzed transformation reactions are gearing accelerating attention in this context as potential alternatives to classical chemical methods. Peroxidases are catalysts able to decontaminate an array of toxic compounds by a free radical mechanism resulting in oxidized or depolymerized products along with a significant toxicity reduction. Admittedly, enzymatic catalysis offers the hallmark of high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity and superior catalytic efficiency under given reaction environment. Moreover, enzymes are considered more benign, socially acceptable and greener production routes since derived from the renewable and sustainable feedstock. Regardless of their versatility and potential use in environmental processes, several limitations, such as heterologous production, catalytic stability, and redox potential should be overcome to implement peroxidases at large-scale transformation and bio-elimination of recalcitrant pollutants. In this article, a critical review of the transformation of different types of hazardous pollutants by peroxidases, with special reference to the proposed reaction mechanisms of several dyes is presented. Following that major challenges for industrial and environmental applications of peroxidases are also discussed. Towards the end, the information is also given on miscellaneous applications of peroxidases, concluding remarks and outlook. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Socio-Economic Status and Health: Evaluation of Human Biomonitored
   Chemical Exposure to Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances across Status
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Research on the environment, health, and well-being nexus (EHWB) is shifting from a silo toward a systemic approach that includes the socio-economic context. To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%-14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity.

TI A critical review of the occurrence of perfluoroalkyl acids in aqueous
   environments and their removal by adsorption onto carbon nanotubes
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY
AB The presence of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in aquatic environments is a cause of concern, due to their toxicity, possible ecological impact and adverse effects in man. The release of these pollutants into receiving water bodies occurs primarily through the discharge of untreated wastewater and industrial effluents. Consequently, there is a need to remediate wastewater containing these compounds before its discharge. In this review, the occurrence of PFAAs in water streams is reviewed, with the aim of providing in-depth information on the harmful effects arising through exposure to these pollutants by both man and the environment. One viable strategy for the removal of PFAAs from wastewaters is adsorption. This technique is discussed in relation to a number of conventional adsorbents and they are compared with the behaviour of a more effective adsorbent, namely, carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In particular, various functionalization strategies can increase the efficiency of CNTs for the removal of PFAAs. Sorption of PFAAs onto CNTs demonstrates good removal efficiencies and equilibrium is attained faster than with conventional adsorbents. This is attributed to the inherent properties of CNTs, such as large surface area/porosity, and the ease with which new functional groups are introduced onto the walls of the tubes. The adsorption mechanism of PFAAs is primarily enhanced through electrostatic interactions; however, other intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and ion-exchange, also play a role. This review aims at providing information on the occurrence and fate of PFAAs and the interactions involved in their removal from aqueous solutions by CNTs.

TI Foreign Body Granuloma After Cranial Surgery: A Systematic Review of
   Reported Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: In cranial surgery, different foreign body (FB) materials are used and may be left intentionally or unintentionally in the surgical field after closure, inducing a foreign body granuloma (FBG). This is a rare complication in neurosurgery, but it may be a diagnostic dilemma, with sometimes medicolegal implications.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the English literature between 1965 and 2018 and found a total of 77 articles concerning 100 cases of FBG caused by retained material located within the cranium or surrounding soft tissues.
   RESULTS: There were 60 females and 40 males, with ages ranging from 1 to 77 years. Most initial diagnoses were cranial/intracranial tumors, trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, intracranial aneurysm, hydrocephalus, head injury, infectious disease, and nontraumatic intracerebral hematoma. The interval from the causative surgical operation to presentation of the FBG ranged from 2 weeks to 20 years. Various radiologic modalities were used and histologic study confirmed the presence of FBG in all patients. Intentional FB was used and left in 77 patients, and unintentional FB was found postoperatively in 23 patients. Associated infection was found in 13 patients. Complete recovery was seen in 47.6% of patients with sufficient data.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite being unusual, a retained FBG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient after cranial surgery. A history of surgery, clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and the use of appropriate neuroimaging explorations may provide a correct preoperative diagnosis. In addition, unintentionally retained FBs are preventable errors in the operating room.

TI Human and veterinary antibiotics induce hormesis in plants: Scientific
   and regulatory issues and an environmental perspective
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Veterinary and human pharmaceuticals have been widely used in the developed world, thus increasing their accumulation in the environment and thereby posing ecological risks. Earlier studies report that active pharmaceutical ingredients induce hormesis in plants, i.e. at low doses may enhance plant health whereas at high doses may suppress plant vigor. There is hitherto no study critically reviewing the effects of antibiotics on plants within a hormetic context despite effects of low doses on plants can have implications to animals, including humans, and to ecological processes. This study critically reviews for first time antibiotic-induced hormesis in plants, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Hormesis was induced by several antibiotics in a variety of species and endpoints. The maximum stimulatory response (MAX) was commonly < 1.5-fold the control response and the distance from MAX to no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was commonly up to 10-fold. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluations are provided and discussed in relation to scientific and regulatory aspects. Low doses of antibiotics are equally important as high doses as they can negatively affect plants, depending on plant tissues and the time tissues are subject to exposure. Antibiotic-induced hormesis in plants provides a significant environmental perspective and should be incorporated into the hazard and risk assessment process.
   Capsule: Common antibiotics released in the environment induce hormesis in plants, urging for re-examination of the risk assessment practices by worldwide regulatory agencies.

TI Modelling Laboratory Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Using Cobalt Catalysts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
AB The main goal of this paper is to critically review current microkinetics available for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) modelling, in order to propose the best way to follow this set of complex reactions; therefore a microkinetic model was developed for FTS, accomplishing surface chemistry, heterogeneous kinetics, and single-event previous development for Co-based catalysts. Model starts simulating CO activation on catalyst surface, and then formation of methane, ethane and subsequent chain growth. Reaction rates were derived following the formalism of Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW); surface steps were proposed in consequence of feasibility. Chain growth was modelled by single-event steps, taking into account geometrical conformation explicitly. Number of growth steps of 1-olefins was rectified as requiring one more active site than mechanisms proposed previously; it was found that formation of these olefins exhibits a fast drop in chain growth; this phenomenon is explained in terms of probable geometrical conformations that lead to the number of single events. Experimental results in literature about isothermal synthesis of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range were simulated in a fixed-bed laboratory reactor; thermodynamic consistency was derived from chemical equilibrium over all reactions occurring during FTS. Equilibrium constants were evaluated as function of Gibbs free energy, and partial pressures of reactants and products.

TI Intracranial foreign material granulomas after cranial surgery
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Various synthetic materials are used in neurosurgery and left in place intentionally during surgery for several purposes such as hemostasis, dural closure, or cranioplasty. Although leaving such substances in surgical sites is considered safe, in general, foreign body granuloma may occur months or years after intracranial surgery. Thus, far relatively little is known about treatment and outcome of such lesions.
   A systematic review of 3466 histopathological examinations after cranial surgeries achieved over a 13-year period was performed. After excluding patients with Teflon granulomas or infection, a total of 12 patients with foreign body granulomas induced by synthetic material used in a prior surgery were identified. Patient records, imaging studies, and histopathological data were analyzed. Furthermore, postoperative outcome was assessed.
   Mean age at the second surgery was 51 years (range, 11-68 years). The median time between the primary and the secondary surgery was 13 months (range, 1-545 months). Eight patients (75%) presented with signs and symptoms related to the foreign body granulomas. Total resection of the foreign body granulomas was performed in all patients. The granulomas were induced by oxidized cellulose polymer (n = 6), suture material (n = 3), Gelfoam (n = 1), methylmethacrylate (n = 1), and bone wax (n = 1). The mean postoperative follow-up time was 54 months (range 1-137 months). There was symptomatic improvement in all instances. Imaging studies did not demonstrate any recurrence.
   Despite its rarity, foreign body granuloma should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of intracranial mass lesions especially in cases of suspected tumor recurrence after prior surgery. The pathogenesis of foreign body granuloma still needs further clarification. Our study demonstrates that they have good prognosis after surgical removal.

TI Serum Perfluorooctanoic Acid and Birthweight: An Updated Meta-analysis
   With Bias Analysis
SO EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: A recent meta-analysis of 15 studies found a change in birthweight of -12.8g (95% CI = -23.1, -2.38) per ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood and -27.1g (-50.6, -3.6) per log ng/ml PFOA. Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6,019 births to the previous 6,937 births.
   Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis.
   Results: We found a change of birthweight of -10.5g (-16.7, -4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (-1.0g; 95% CI = -2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5,393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (-3.3g [-9.6, 3.0]). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (-17.8 [-25.0, -10.6]).
   Conclusion: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight. These are studies in which confounding and reverse causality would be of less concern.

TI The biological role of N-acyl-homoserine lactone-based quorum sensing
   (QS) in EPS production and microbial community assembly during anaerobic
   granulation process
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Although N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL) based quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon has been observed in mature anaerobic granules, the biological role of AHL-based QS system in anaerobic granulation process remains unexplored. For the first time, a long-term anaerobic bioreactor was operated for 168 days to investigate the biological role of AHL in the granulation process which was divided into three phases (phase I: floccular, phase II: granulation, phase III: maturation). Two different AHLs including C8-HSL and C10-HSL were characterized at nanogram levels. The AHL level was elevated over 20-fold and strongly positively correlated with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production and sludge particle size during phase I-II. Exogenous addition of AHL to the floccular sludge also resulted in significantly increased EPS production. Metadata analysis suggested that the granulation process was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of QS-relevant microorganisms. The strong relationships (R > 0.9233, p < 0.01) among AHL concentrations, EPS (except loosely bound EPS), granulation and community variation indicated that AHL-mediated QS played an important role in coordinating community level behaviors associated with granulation, potentially through the regulation of EPS production and composition. This study gives a deep insight into the underlying QS-relevant mechanism of anaerobic granulation process.

TI Investigation of mRNA expression changes associated with field exposure
   to DDTs in chickens from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
AB The objective of this study was to identify potential mRNA expression changes in chicken livers associated with environmental exposure to dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDTs). In particular, we focused on genes relating to the immune system and metabolism. We analyzed liver samples from free-ranging chickens in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for contamination by DDTs. This area predominantly uses DDT in its malaria control program, and homes are sprayed annually with the pesticide. Genes relating to the immune system and metabolism were selected as potential genetic biomarkers that could be linked to higher contamination with DDTs. RT-qPCR analysis on 39 samples showed strong correlations between DDTs contamination and mRNA expression for the following genes: AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD6 and AvBD7(down-regulated), and CYP17, ELOVL2 and SOLE (up-regulated). This study shows for the first time interesting and significant correlations between genetic material collected from environmentally-exposed chickens and mRNA expression of several genes involved in immunity and metabolism. These findings show the usefulness of analysis on field samples from a region with high levels of environmental contamination in detecting potential biomarkers of exposure. In particular, we observed clear effects from DDT contamination on mRNA expression of genes involved in immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, and lipid dysregulation. These results are of interest in guiding future studies to further elucidate the pathways involved in and clinical importance of toxicity associated with DDT exposure from contaminated environments, to ascertain the health risk to livestock and any subsequent risks to food security for people.

TI Perfluorinated Chemicals as Emerging Environmental Threats to Kidney
   Health A Scoping Review
SO CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
AB Background and objectives Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of manufactured nonbiodegradable compounds. Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys.
   Results We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2-related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling.
   Conclusions A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are emerging environmental threats to kidney health; yet several important gaps in our understanding still exist.

TI Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale vs. medical treatment for
   patients with history of cryptogenic stroke: A systematic review and
   meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
SO CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
AB Background: Patients with history of cryptogenic stroke are more likely to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and should be managed with antithrombotic agents, while the alternative option is percutaneous closure of PFOs. Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous closure vs. medical treatment for patients with PFO and prior cryptogenic stroke.
   Methods: Medline, Scopus and Cochrane databases were reviewed. A random-effect model meta-analysis was used and I-square was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. New ischemic stroke was defined as the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis was performed for Amplatzer device. Subgroup analyses were performed for different patient and PFO characteristics for the composite endpoints as defined by the included RCTs.
   Results: In total of 3440 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Closure devices were superior to medical therapy for prevention of recurrent ischemic strokes (HR = 0.29; CI: 0.02-0.56), but were associated with increased risk of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (RR = 4.67; CI: 2.22-9.81). However, in the sensitivity analysis for Amplatzer device, there was no difference between the two groups in new onset of atrial arrhythmias. Closure devices were superior across all different subgroups when compared to medical treatment with the exception of patients with a small shunt.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that closure devices for patients with PFO and history of cryptogenic stroke can significantly decrease the risk of a new ischemic stroke. The use of Amplatzer device was not associated with increased risk of newly diagnosed atrial arrhythmias. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Emerging pollutants removal through advanced drinking water treatment: A
   review on processes and environmental performances assessment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The presence of emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment in relatively small concentrations and the fact that they cannot be removed by conventional water/wastewater treatment processes bring new challenges in terms of adequate selection of technologies from the technical, economical and environmental points of view. Generally, literature discusses emerging pollutants' removal at significant concentrations (such as those in wastewater), while few studies consider their low concentrations occurring in raw water. This study presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to the occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts of emerging pollutants on advanced drinking water treatment and the environmental performance evaluation of different technological options, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies consider pollutants removed, process conditions and removal efficiencies, thus making possible comparisons between membrane processes, advanced oxidation processes and adsorption on activated carbon and other materials. The study is completed by an analysis of the environmental assessment instruments (life cycle assessment, carbon, water footprints, other type of assessments) that may be used for selecting sustainable advanced drinking water treatment processes able to remove emerging pollutants. This paper critically reviews the main research topics concerning emerging pollutants: classification, legislative framework, up-to-date removal processes and their environmental performances assessment, to offer a comprehensive analysis of the strategic issues that may constitute future research directions for sustainable water supply.

TI Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposure in Early Life Increases Risk of
   Childhood Adiposity: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Some articles have examined perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in early life in relation to risk of childhood adiposity. Nevertheless, the results from epidemiological studies exploring the associations remain inconsistent and contradictory. We thus conducted an analysis of data currently available to examine the association between PFOA exposure in early life and risk of childhood adiposity. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies that examined the impact of PFOA exposure in early life on childhood adiposity. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to pool the statistical estimates. We identified ten prospective cohort studies comprising 6076 participants with PFOA exposure. The overall effect size (relative risk or odds ratio) for childhood overweight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.50; I-2 = 40.5%). In addition, exposure to PFOA in early life increased the z-score of childhood body mass index (beta = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17; I-2 = 27.9%). Accordingly, exposure to PFOA in early life is associated with an increased risk for childhood adiposity. Further research is needed to verify these findings and to shed light on the molecular mechanism of PFOA in adiposity.

TI Patent foramen ovale closure for patients with cryptogenic stroke: A
   systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of 5 randomized
   controlled trials and 14 observational studies
SO CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB BackgroundPrevious review from randomized controlled trials (RCT) showed that patients with cryptogenic stroke may benefit from patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. However, the findings from the systematic review were not clear when observational studies were also included.
   MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The primary endpoints were recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The secondary outcomes were all-cause death, atrial fibrillation (AF), and hemorrhagic events.
   ResultsFive randomized trials and fourteen observational studies (6301 participants) were eligible. PFO closure was superior to medical therapy for stroke prevention risk ratios ([RR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.60), but showed increased risk of AF (RR, 4.96; 95% CI, 2.31-10.7). There was no significant difference in TIA recurrence, death, and hemorrhagic events. Subgroup analyses showed that patients with factors such as substantial residual shunt, the presence of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), male, and age <45years had a lower risk of recurrent stroke when PFOs were closed.
   ConclusionsIn patients with cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure does appeared to be superior to medical therapy in stroke prevention, with an increased incidence of AF. Male, age <45years, substantial residual shunt, and the history of ASA are the factors that will predict the benefit when PFO is closed.

TI Integrative Chemical Proteomics-Metabolomics Approach Reveals
   Acaca/Acacb as Direct Molecular Targets of PFOA
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Identification of the direct molecular targets of environmental pollutants is of great importance for toxicity mechanism studies. Despite numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the toxicity mechanism of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), their direct-binding protein targets which trigger downstream toxicity effects remain largely unknown. Herein, we present a systematic chemical proteomic study to profile the target proteins of PFCs by taking PFOA as a representative. Considering its electrophilicity, PFOA could preferentially bind to reactive cysteine-containing proteins. Therefore, two complementary cysteine-targeting probes, iodoacetamide alkyne (IAA) and ethynyl benziodoxolone azide (EBX), were selected to enrich the putative target proteins in the absence or presence of PFOA. Quantitative proteomic analysis of the enriched proteins identified Acaca and Acacb as novel target proteins of PFOA. We then applied parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted proteomics study combined with thermal shift assay-based chemical proteomics to verify Acaca and Acacb as bona fide binding targets. These findings afford a plausible explanation for the PFOA-induced liver toxicity, especially regarding abnormal fatty acid metabolism that was validated by targeted metabolomics analysis. The present study documents an integrative chemical proteomics-metabolomics platform that facilitates the authentic identification of proteins that are 'targeted by small molecules and its potential to be applied for toxicity mechanism studies of environmental pollutants.

TI Efficient Imaging: Examining the Value of Ultrasound in the Diagnosis of
   Traumatic Adult Brachial Plexus Injuries, A Systematic Review
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brachial plexus injury (BPI) can result in debilitating sequelae of the upper extremity. Presently, therapeutic decisions are based on the mechanism of injury, serial physical examination, electromyography, nerve conduction, and imaging studies. While magnetic resonance imaging is the current imaging modality of choice for BPI, ultrasound is a promising newcomer that is inexpensive, accessible, and available at point of care.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ultrasound as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of traumatic adult BPI through a systematic review.
   METHODS: An electronic literature search was completed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases up to July 2016. Two independent reviewers completed the screening and data extraction. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Statistical analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivities and study heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: Seven studies were included. Four studies compared the detection of pre- and postganglionic lesions at different levels (C5-T1) to surgical exploration as the reference standard. Sensitivity of lesion detection was greater in the upper and middle spinal nerves: C5 (93%, confidence interval [CI] = 78%-100%), C6 (94%, CI = 82%-100%), and C7 (95%, CI = 86%-100%) than in the lower: C8 (71%, CI = 36%-95%) and T1 (56%, CI = 29%-81%).
   CONCLUSION: Individual studies demonstrate ultrasound as an effective diagnostic tool for traumatic adult BPI. Sensitivity of lesion detection was noted to be greater in the upper and middle (C5-C7) than in the lower spinal nerves (C8, T1). Further standardized studies should be performed to confirm the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of traumatic adult BPI.

TI Assessment of endocrine disruptors effects on zebrafish (Danio rerio)
   embryos by untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomic analysis
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Bisphenol A (BPA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and tributyltin (TBT) are emerging endocrine disruptors (EDCs) with still poorly defined mechanisms of toxicity and metabolic effects in aquatic organisms. We used an untargeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomic approach to study the effects of sub-lethal doses of these three EDCs on the metabolic profiles of zebrafish embryos exposed from 48 to 120 hpf (hours post fertilization). Advanced chemometric data analysis methods were used to reveal effects on the subjacent regulatory pathways. EDC treatments induced changes in concentrations of about 50 metabolites for TBT and BPA, and of 25 metabolites for PFOS. The analysis of the corresponding metabolic changes suggested the presence of similar underlying zebrafish responses to BPA, TBT and PFOS affecting the metabolism of glycerophospholipids, amino acids, purines and 2-oxocarboxylic acids. We related the changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism to alterations in absorption of the yolk sack, the main source of nutrients (including lipids) for the developing embryo, linking the molecular markers with adverse phenotypic effects. We propose a general mode of action for all three chemical compounds, probably related to their already described interaction with the PPAR/RXR complex, combined with specific effects on different signaling pathways resulting in particular alterations in the zebrafish embryos metabolism.

TI Analytical approaches for the determination of personal care products
   and evaluation of their occurrence in marine organisms
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Contamination of the aquatic environment caused by multiple human activities may exert a negative impact on all living organisms. Several contaminants of emerging concern such as personal care products (PCPs) are continuously released into the aquatic environment where they are biologically active and persistent.
   This work reviews the current knowledge, provided by papers published after 2010 and indexed by SciFinder, Scopus, and Google search engines, about the determination and occurrence of PCPs in marine biota. Analytical methodologies have been critically reviewed, emphasizing the importance of green and high-throughput approaches and focusing the discussion on the complexity of the solute-matrix interaction in the extraction step, as well as the matrix effect in the instrumental determination. Finally, the worldwide distribution of PCPs is surveyed, taking into account the concentrations found in the same organism in different marine environments. Differences among various world areas have been highlighted, evidencing some critical aspects from an environmental point of view. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A critical review of mechanisms involved in the adsorption of organic
   and inorganic contaminants through biochar
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
AB Successful application of low-cost adsorbent like biochar has introduced multidisciplinary areas of science, particularly with respect to remediation of both organic and inorganic contaminants in soil and water. This review briefly consolidates the currently available literature to comprehend the overall adsorption mechanisms of organic and inorganic contaminants through biochar. Generally, biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperature is suitable for the adsorption of inorganic contaminants by following the adsorption mechanisms of electrostatic interaction, precipitation, and ion exchange. However, relatively high pyrolysis temperature favors the adsorption of organic contaminants by increasing the surface area and micropores of biochar along with pore filling and hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction as predominant adsorption mechanisms. This review also summarizes the critical factors (pyrolysis temperature, solution pH, dosage of biochar, contact time, co-existed ions, modification/activation, aging process, etc) affecting the overall adsorption efficiency of the biochar. Overall, further field studies and experimentation are required for the reduction of cost in biochar production and its reuse.

TI Metabolomic study for essential hypertension patients based on dried
   blood spot mass spectrometry approach
SO IUBMB LIFE
AB Hypertension is an increasingly serious public-health challenge worldwide. The traditional blood pressure measurement method could easily and reliably detect blood pressure. However, the delayed symptom onset may influence the screening of essential hypertension (EH). In addition, EH is significantly associated to cardiovascular disease, stroke and kidney disease. Hence, it is urgent to define associated biomarkers with early diagnosis potential for EH. A dried blood spot method integrated with direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic analysis was applied for the detection of metabolites toward 87 EH patients and 91 healthy controls (HC). Multiple algorithms were run on training set (62 EH and 64 HC) for selecting differential metabolites as potential biomarkers. A test set (25 EH and 27 HC) was used to verify and evaluate selected potential biomarkers. A novel blood biomarker model based on Gly, Orn, C10, Orn/Cit, Phe/Tyr, and C5-OH/C8 exhibited potential to differentiate EH patients from HC individuals, with a sensitivity of 0.8400 and a specificity of 0.8889 in test set. The metabolomic analysis of EH is beneficial to the definition of disease-associated biomarkers and the development of new diagnostic approaches. (C) 2018

TI Photodegradation of perfluorooctanoic acid by graphene oxide-deposited
   TiO2 nanotube arrays in aqueous phase
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent organic pollutant in the environment with serious health risks including endocrine-disrupting characteristics, immunotoxicity, and causing developmental defects. The photocatalytic deposition has proven to be an inexpensive, effective, and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOA in the aqueous phase. Most investigations are conducted in ultrapure water at concentrations higher than those detected in actual water systems. A few studies deal with the toxicity of treated water. In this research, the photocatalytic degradation of PFOA, including photo oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared to photo oxidation, photo-reduction is more suitable for PFOA removal since it favors defluorination of PFOA and complete mineralization. We used graphene oxide/TiO2 nanotubes array for photocatalytic degradation of PFOA. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination processes of PFOA, such as initial PFOA concentration, initial pH of the solution, an initial temperature of the solution, and external bias constant potential, are addressed. We observed that at pH 3 the PFOA degradation was around 83% in 4 h, and at 75 degrees C almost complete PFOA degradation was observed in 2.5 h. In photoelectrocatalytic process at 2.0 V external bias 97% of PFOA was degraded in 4 h. The mechanisms of the PFOA photodegradation process are also discussed in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Fluorinated Gold Nanoparticles for Nanostructure Imaging Mass
   Spectrometry
SO ACS NANO
AB Nanostructure imaging mass spectrometry (NIMS) with fluorinated gold nanoparticles (f-AuNPs) is a nanoparticle assisted laser desorption/ionization approach that requires low laser energy and has demonstrated high sensitivity. Here we describe NIMS with fAuNPs for the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in biological tissues. F-AuNPs assist in desorption/ionization by laser-induced release of the fluorocarbon chains with minimal background noise. Since the energy barrier required to release the fluorocarbons from the AuNPs is minimal, the energy of the laser is maintained in the low FJ/pulse range, thus limiting metabolite in-source fragmentation. Electron microscopy analysis of tissue samples after fAuNP NIMS shows a distinct "raising" of the surface as compared to matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ablation, indicative of a gentle desorption mechanism aiding in the generation of intact molecular ions. Moreover, the use of perfluorohexane to distribute the fAuNPs on the tissue creates a hydrophobic environment minimizing metabolite solubilization and spatial dislocation. The transfer of the energy from the incident laser to the analytes through the release of the fluorocarbon chains similarly enhances the desorption/ionization of metabolites of different chemical nature, resulting in heterogeneous metabolome coverage. We performed the approach in a comparative study of the colon of mice exposed to three different diets. F-AuNP NIMS allows the direct detection of carbohydrates, lipids, bile acids, sulfur metabolites, amino acids, nucleotide precursors as well as other small molecules of varied biological origins. Ultimately, the diversified molecular coverage obtained provides a broad picture of a tissue's metabolic organization.

TI Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and risk of diabetes: an evidence-based
   review
SO DIABETOLOGIA
AB The purpose of this study was to review the epidemiological and experimental evidence linking background exposure to a selection of environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism. The review summarises the literature on both cross-sectional and prospective studies in humans, as well as experimental in vivo and in vitro studies. The findings were subjected to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found > 40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for p,p'-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development. Best evidence exists for p,p'-DDE. For other chemicals, both prospective studies and supporting animal data are still lacking.

TI Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in global lakes: A review
   and meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Lakes are an important source of freshwater, containing nearly 90% of the liquid surface fresh water worldwide. Long retention times in lakes mean pollutants from discharges slowly circulate around the lakes and may lead to high ecological risk for ecosystem and human health. In recent decades, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants. The occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in global freshwater lakes are summarized to show the pollution level of antibiotics and ARGs and to identify some of the potential risks to ecosystem and human health. Fifty-seven antibiotics were reported at least once in the studied lakes. Our meta-analysis shows that sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfameter, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and roxithromycin were found at high concentrations in both lake water and lake sediment. There is no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamides in lake water from China and that from other countries worldwide; however, there was a significant difference in quinolones. Erythromycin had the lowest predicted hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) and the highest ecological risk in lakes. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in lake water and river water. There is surprisingly limited research on the role of aquatic biota in propagation of ARGs in freshwater lakes. As an environment that is susceptible to cumulative build-up of pollutants, lakes provide an important environment to study the fate of antibiotics and transport of ARGs with a broad range of niches including bacterial community, aquatic plants and animals.

TI Application of Elemental Lanthanides in the Selective C-F Activation of
   Trifluoromethylated Benzofulvenes Providing Access to Various
   Difluoroalkenes
SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB The selective activation of one carbon-fluorine bond in polyfluorinated aromatic molecules or in trifluoromethyl-containing substrates offers the possibility of accessing unique fluorine-containing molecules, which are difficult to obtain by other synthetic pathways. Among various metals, which can undergo C-F activation, lanthanides (Ln) are good candidates as they form strong Ln-F bonds. Lanthanide metals are strong reducing agents with a redox potential Ln(3+)/Ln of approximately -2.3 V, which is comparable to the value of the Mg2+/Mg redox couple. In addition, lanthanide metals display a promising functional group tolerance and their reactivity can vary along the lanthanide series, making them suitable reagents for fine-tuning reaction conditions in organic and organometallic transformations. However, due to their oxophilicity, lanthanides react readily with oxygen and water and therefore require special conditions for storage, handling, preparation, and activation. These factors have limited a more widespread use in organic synthesis. We herein present how dysprosium metal - and by analogy all lanthanide metals - can be freshly prepared under anhydrous conditions using glovebox and Schlenk techniques. The freshly filed metal, in combination with aluminum chloride, initiates the selective C-F activation in trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes. The resulting reaction intermediates react with nitroalkenes to obtain a new family of difluoroalkenes.

TI Comparing surgical interventions for intertrochanteric hip fracture by
   blood loss and operation time: a network meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB Background: Multiple operative treatments are available for the fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. This analysis was conducted to provide guidance on the appropriate clinical choice to accommodate individual patients.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify relevant articles in databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were eligible if they compared 2 or more of the following interventions: proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) use, dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation, gamma nail (GN) fixation, and artificial femoral head replacement (FHR). Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to simultaneously compare all treatment methods.
   Results: In total, 24 active-comparator studies involving 3097 participants were identified. Across all populations, greater reductions in blood loss and operation time were observed for PFNA than for other treatments. In terms of bleeding, more blood loss was observed for DHS use than for the PFNA (SMD, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.01-1.96), PCCP (SMD, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.31-2.20), and GN (SMD, 0.26; 95% CI, -0.35-0.87) techniques. However, a more beneficial effect was observed for DHS use than for FHR (SMD, -0.23; 95% CI, -1.26-0.81). DHS use resulted in a significantly longer duration of operation time than the PFNA (SMD, 0.75; 95% CI, -0.02-0.75), PCCP (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, -0.20-1.44), and GN (SMD, 0.25; 95% CI, -0.26-0.77) techniques. Similarly, greater reductions in operation time were observed for DHS use than for FHR (SMD, -0.12; 95% CI, -1.15-0.91).
   Conclusions: The findings provide supporting evidence demonstrating the superiority of PFNA over other treatments for intertrochanteric femoral fracture. PFNA treatment results in the lowest amount of blood loss and the shortest operation time. These findings add to the existing knowledge of intertrochanteric femoral fracture treatment options.

TI Recent technical and biological development in the analysis of biomarker
   N-deoxyguanosine-C8-4-aminobiphenyl
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB 4-Aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) which is primarily formed during tobacco combustion and overheated meat is a major carcinogen responsible for various cancers. Its adducted form, N-deoxyguanosine-C8-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8-4-ABP), has long been employed as a biomarker for assessment of the risk for cancer. In this review, the metabolism and carcinogenisity of 4-ABP will be discussed, followed by a discussion of the current common approaches of analyzing dG-C8-4-ABP. The major part of this review will be on the history and recent development of key methods for detection and quantitation of dG-C8-4-ABP in complex biological samples and their biological applications, from the traditional P-2-postlabelling and immunoassay methods to modern liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with the latter as the focus. Many vital biological discoveries based on dG-C8-4-ABP have been published by using the nanoLC-MS with column switching platform in our laboratory, which has also been adopted and further improved by many other researchers. We hope this review can provide a perspective of the challenges that had to be addressed in reaching our present goals and possibly bring new ideas for those who are still working on the frontline of DNA adducts area.

TI Glucose challenge metabolomics implicates medium-chain acylcarnitines in
   insulin resistance
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Insulin resistance (IR) predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease but its causes are incompletely understood. Metabolic challenges like the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can reveal pathogenic mechanisms. We aimed to discover associations of IR with metabolite trajectories during OGTT. In 470 non-diabetic men (age 70.6 +/- 0.6 years), plasma samples obtained at 0, 30 and 120 minutes during an OGTT were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics. IR was assessed with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method. We applied age-adjusted linear regression to identify metabolites whose concentration change was related to IR. Nine trajectories, including monounsaturated fatty acids, lysophosphatidylethanolamines and a bile acid, were significantly associated with IR, with the strongest associations observed for medium-chain acylcarnitines C10 and C12, and no associations with L-carnitine or C2-, C8-, C14- or C16-carnitine. Concentrations of C10-and C12-carnitine decreased during OGTT with a blunted decline in participants with worse insulin resistance. Associations persisted after adjustment for obesity, fasting insulin and fasting glucose. In mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to different acylcarnitines, we observed blunted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after treatment with C10-or C12-carnitine. In conclusion, our results identify medium-chain acylcarnitines as possible contributors to IR.

TI Mechanisms Underpinning the Polypharmacy Effects of Medications in
   Psychiatry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Background: Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition with progressive social and cognitive function disturbances. Most patients' treatments are based on polypharmacy, but with no biological basis and little is known of the drugs' interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of lithium, valproate, quetiapine, and lamotrigine, and the interactions between them, on markers of inflammation, bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress in neuron-like cells and microglial cells.
   Methods: Neuron-like cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells were treated with lithium (2.5 mM), valproate (0.5 mM), quetiapine (0.05 mM), and lamotrigine (0.05 mM) individually and in all possible combinations for 24 h. Twenty cytokines were measured in the media from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells. Metabolic flux analysis was used to measure bioenergetics, and real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mitochondrial function genes in neuron-like cells. The production of superoxide in treated cells was also assessed.
   Results: The results suggest major inhibitory effects on proinflammatory cytokine release as a therapeutic mechanism of these medications when used in combination. The various combinations of medications also caused overexpression of PGC1 alpha and ATPSA1 in neuron-like cells. Quetiapine appears to have a proinflammatory effect in microglial cells, but this was reversed by the addition of lamotrigine independent of the drug combination.
   Conclusion: Polypharmacy in bipolar disorder may have antiinflammatory effects on microglial cells as well as effects on mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells.

TI Analytical challenges to determine emerging persistent organic
   pollutants in aquatic ecosystems
SO TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Emerging persistent organic pollutants (ePOPs) include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride/perfluorooctane sulfonate (POSF/PFOS), which are newly listed in the Stockholm Convention. Other ePOPs, which have not been regulated, include organophosphate flame retardants (PFRs), novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and other perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Often ePOPs data related to occurrence, toxicity, impact or environmental behavior are insufficient or inadequate because of the lack of proper analytical methods to obtain them. Thus, a critical review of the analytical procedures proposed in the last six years (2011-2017) for determining ePOPs by chromatographic methods in the different compartments of the aquatic ecosystems is presented. The overall analytical procedure, from sampling to final determination, is emphasized presenting recent developments in the extraction, pre-concentration, and instrumental detection needed for the accurate quantification of ePOPs in environmental samples. Finally, this review examines the basic challenges we face in order to anticipate future directions and urgent needs of this field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The impact of fast track protocols in upper gastrointestinal surgery: A
   meta-analysis of observational studies
SO SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND
   IRELAND
AB Background: Fast track surgery has been implemented in colorectal procedures during the last decade and is accompanied by significant improvement in patient outcomes during the early postoperative period. However, to date, its adoption in upper gastrointestinal surgery remains a matter of debate. In this context, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence in the international literature.
   Materials and methods: We searched Medline, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register databases for published randomized controlled trials. The meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3.5 software.
   Main findings: Thirty studies were finally included in the present meta-analysis. The postoperative morbidity was not influenced by the implementation of fast track surgery (FTS) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64-1.09). However, in cases treated with laparoscopic surgery fast track surgery seemed to reduce morbidity by 50% (p =.006). The overall mortality of patients was low in the majority of included studies and was not influenced by fast track surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.50-2.52). The duration of postoperative hospitalization was significantly reduced with the adoption of FTS (MD 2.24, 95% CI 2.63 to 1.85 days). Concurrently, the overall cost was significantly reduced in cases treated with FTS (MD 982.30, 95% CI -1367.68 to -596.91 U.S dollars).
   Conclusion: According to the findings of our meta-analysis suggest that FTS seems to be safe in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgery and reduce both the days of postoperative hospitalization and the overall cost. This observation should be taken into account in future recommendations to enhance the implementation of FTS protocols in current clinical practice.

TI Breastfeeding as a Predictor of Serum Concentrations of Per- and
   Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances in Reproductive-Aged Women and Young
   Children: A Rapid Systematic Review
SO CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS
AB Purpose of reviewPer- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetic chemicals widely detected in human serum, and at low levels in breast milk. We conducted a rapid systematic review on breastfeeding practices and serum concentrations of PFASs-specifically PFOS and PFOA-among reproductive-aged women and young children using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology.Recent findingsWe included 14 studies examining associations between breastfeeding and PFASs in infants/toddlers or pregnant/postnatal women. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with lower PFASs exposure among women and higher PFASs exposure among children.SummaryWe concluded there was "sufficient" evidence supporting an association between breastfeeding and serum PFASs concentrations among women, and "limited" evidence of an association among children due to issues with sample size, confounding, and exposure assessment. These findings reinforce that lactation is an important excretion route of PFASs for women, and that breast milk may be an important exposure pathway for young children.

   spectrometry method for the quantitation of brivaracetam acid
   metabolites: Method validation and application to in vitro metabolism
   assays
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new high affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand recently approved for adults with partial-onset seizures. As a support to in vitro metabolism assays, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method coupled to off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) was developed to quantify BRV acid metabolites, that is, BRV-AC (carboxylic derivative derived from BRV hydrolysis) and BRV-OHAC (corresponding to hydroxylated BRV-AC). The method was validated for various incubates (liver and kidney tissue homogenates and blood, all from humans) and applied to in vitro metabolism assays. The analytes were isolated from buffered samples using ISOLUTE C8 96-well SPE plates. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters Atlantis T3 C18 analytical column (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 5 mu m) with detection accomplished using a Waters Premier tandem mass spectrometer in positive ion electrospray and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The standard curves, which ranged from 1.00 to 200 ng/mL for BRV-AC, BRV-OHAC, were fitted to a 1/x(2) weighted linear regression model. The infra-assay precision and inter-assay precision (expressed as coefficient of variation-%CV) were < 8.5%, and the assay accuracy (deviation- %Dev) was within +/- 7.1% for the different matrices. This accurate, precise, and selective SPE/LC-MS/MS method has been successfully applied to in vitro assays aimed at characterizing the kinetics of BRV hydrolysis. BRV was found to be a better substrate for hydrolysis than its hydroxylated metabolite BRV-OH. BRV hydrolysis was detected in blood, liver and kidneys, demonstrating the broad distribution of the enzyme catalyzing the reaction.

TI Fluorinated Paramagnetic Complexes: Sensitive and Responsive Probes for
   Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Imaging
SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of chemical and physiological processes is becoming more widespread. The strength of this technique comes from the negligible background signal in in vivo F-19 MRI and the large chemical shift window of F-19 that enables it to image concomitantly more than one marker. These same advantages have also been successfully exploited in the design of responsive F-19 probes. Part of the recent growth of this technique can be attributed to novel designs of F-19 probes with improved imaging parameters due to the incorporation of paramagnetic metal ions. In this review, we provide a description of the theories and strategies that have been employed successfully to improve the sensitivity of F-19 probes with paramagnetic metal ions. The Bloch-Wangsness-Redfield theory accurately predicts how molecular parameters such as internuclear distance, geometry, rotational correlation times, as well as the nature, oxidation state, and spin state of the metal ion affect the sensitivity of the fluorine-based probes. The principles governing the design of responsive F-19 probes are subsequently described in a "how to" guide format. Examples of such probes and their advantages and disadvantages are highlighted through a synopsis of the literature.

TI Association between perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and thyroid
   function in adults: A meta-analysis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Objective
   Many people are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) because these substances are widely used as industrial products. Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones.
   Methods
   We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs-perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)-and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients.
   Results
   The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8-16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones.
   Conclusions
   Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration.

TI Orange juice affects acylcarnitine metabolism in healthy volunteers as
   revealed by a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach
SO FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Citrus juices, especially orange juice, constitute rich sources of bioactive compounds with a wide range of health-promoting activities. Data from epidemiological and in vitro studies suggest that orange juice (OJ) may have a positive impact on lipid metabolism. However, the effect of orange juice intake on blood lipid profile is still poorly understood.
   We have used two different blood samples, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and plasma, to assess the effect of two-week orange juice consumption in healthy volunteers by a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach. DBS were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and plasma samples were analysed by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
   One hundred sixty-nine lipids including acylcarnitines (AC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC), (diacyl- and acyl-alkyl-) phosphatidylcholines (PC as and PC ae) and sphingomyelins (SM) were identified and quantified in DBS. Eighteen fatty acids were identified and quantified in plasma. Multivariate analysis allowed to identify an increase in C3:1, C5-DC(C6-OH), C5-M-DC, C5:1-DC, C8, C12-DC, lysoPC18:3, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitoleic and palmitic acid and a decrease in nervonic acid, CO, C2, C10, C10:1, C16:1, C16-OH, C16:1-OH, C18-OH, PC as C40:4, PC ae C38:4, PC ae C42:3, PC ae C42:4 and cholesterol levels after orange juice intake.
   A two-week period of orange juice intake could affect fatty acids beta-oxidation through mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways, leading to an increase of short-chain acylcarnitines and a decrease of medium and long-chain acylcarnitines. This is the first report analyzing the effect of orange juice intake in healthy volunteers using a dried blood spot-based metabolomics approach.

TI A critical review of the application of polymer of low concern and
   regulatory criteria to fluoropolymers
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of fluorinated substances that are in the focus of researchers and regulators due to widespread presence in the environment and biota, including humans, of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as polymers of low concern (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. Grouping fluoropolymers with all classes of PFAS for read across or structure-activity relationship assessment is not scientifically appropriate. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2018;14:316-334.

TI Optimisation of protocol for effective detachment and selective recovery
   of the representative bacteria for extraction of metagenomic DNA from
   Eucalyptus spp. woodchips
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS
AB For some environments such as planktonic/aqueous environments, the separation of bacteria cells from eukaryotic cells prior to DNA extraction using filtration is relatively straightforward. However, for woodchips, the bacteria are attached/embedded within the wood matrix, which prevents easy removal of bacterial cells. In this study, a method for the selective extraction of DNA from bacteria inhabiting Eucalyptus spp. woodchips has been developed. The objective was to compare milled and unmilled woodchips processed via three detachment methods, viz., sonication, vortexing and shaking followed by filtration using Teflon filters according to three relevant criteria: DNA yield, DNA purity and quality of DNA. Highest DNA yield was obtained by milling and vortexing for 10 min (77.50 +/- 5.17 ng/mu l), followed by milling and vortexing for 2 min (61.00 +/- 6.56 ng/mu l), unmilled and vortexing for 10 min (38.67 +/- 5.17 ng/mu l) and milled and shaking for 2 h (31.62 +/- 5.17 ng/mu l). The lowest DNA yield was obtained by using unmilled woodchips and 5 min of sonication treatment (7.00 +/- 1.22 ng/mu l). There was no significant difference in DNA purity for milled or unmilled woodchips processed via the three detachment methods. Duration of cell detachment treatment did not significantly influence DNA yield and purity. Following optimisation experiments, it was possible to extract bacterial DNA using milled woodchips and 10 minute vortexing devoid of DNA from the host background and other associated eukaryotes and of sufficient quality and quantity for metagenomic analysis.

TI Assessing the Significance of Hexafluorobenzene as a Unique Guest Agent
   through Stacking Interactions in Substituted Ethynylphenyl Benzamides
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB A series of differently substituted host molecules have been employed to systematically investigate the nature and strength of the stacking interactions with hexafluorobenzene in the solid state. The hexafluorobenzene guest binds to the crystal lattice of the parent compound, the N-ethynylphenyl benzamide host and its nine other halogenated (-F/-CF3/-Cl/-Br at ortho/ meta/para positions individually) analogues via stacking of aromatic rings. The geometrical and energetic features of intermolecular interactions in host-guest molecules have been investigated, and the results elucidate the dominancy of dispersion in the stabilization of the aryl-hexafluorobenzene stacking, while the electrostatic component also plays an important role. The plots of the molecular electrostatic potential provide a fundamental basis of the electrostatic complementarity that exists in between the host and the guest. The topological characterization reveals unambiguous evidence for the direct participation of the substituents in closed-shell bonding interactions with the aromatic rings at the local geometry, which remarkably controls the nature and energetics of such motifs. Additionally, the observed upfield 19F NMR chemical shifts for perfluorinated guest upon complexation with the host compounds provide evidence for the existence of the host-guest stacking interaction also in the solution state.

TI C8-Guanine modifications: effect on Z-DNA formation and its role in
   cancer
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
AB Base modifications are known to affect the structure and function of DNA. C8-guanine adducts from various carcinogenic compounds have been shown to be potent Z-DNA inducers. Hence, it has been hypothesized that Z-DNA plays a role in cancer and other genetic diseases. In this comprehensive review, Z-DNA and the effect of prevalent C8-guanine adducts on the B-Z transition are addressed. The discoveries of Z-DNA binding proteins including ADAR1, E3L, DLM1, and PKZ have suggested the relevance of Z-DNA in living systems. In addition, increasing evidence on the Z-DNA connection to gene transcription and inhibition reveals potential biological functions of the left-handed DNA. Finally, C8-guanine adducts that promote Z-DNA formation can be used as a tool to explore the Z-DNA function and its role in carcinogenesis.

TI Review of the fate and transformation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs) in landfills
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB A critical review of existing publications is presented i) to summarize the occurrence of various classes of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and their sources in landfills, ii) to identify temporal and geographical trends of PFASs in landfills; iii) to delineate the factors affecting PFASs in landfills; and iv) to identify research gaps and future research directions. Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are routinely detected in landfill leachate, with short chain (C4-C7) PFAAs being most abundant, possibly indicating their greater mobility, and reflecting the industrial shift towards shorter-chain compounds. Despite its restricted use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) remains one of the most abundant PFAAs in landfill leachates. Recent studies have also documented the presence of PFAA-precursors (e.g., saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) in landfill leachates at concentrations comparable to, or higher than, the most frequently detected PFAAs. Landfill ambient air also contains elevated concentrations of PFASs, primarily semi-volatile precursors (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols) compared to upwind control sites, suggesting that landfills are potential sources of atmospheric PFASs. The fate of PFASs inside landfills is controlled by a combination of biological and abiotic processes, with biodegradation releasing most of the PFASs from landfilled waste to leachate. Biodegradation in simulated anaerobic reactors has been found to be closely related to the methanogenic phase. The methane yielding stage also results in higher pH (>7) of leachates, correlated with higher mobility of PFAAs. Little information exists regarding PFAA-precursors in landfills. To avoid significant underestimation of the total PFAS released from landfills, PFAA-precursors and their degradation products should be determined in future studies. Owing to the semi-volatile nature of some precursor compounds and their degradation products, future studies also need to include landfill gas to clarify degradation pathways and the overall fate of PFASs.

TI Pelvic floor disorders in women with gynecologic malignancies: a
   systematic review
SO INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) negatively affect quality of life in the general population, and their prevalence in gynecologic cancer survivors has not been systematically described. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of PFDs in cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the prevalence of PFDs in the gynecologic cancer population would be higher than in the general female population.
   We searched PubMed (1809 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) through May 2017. The search combined subject headings, title, and abstract words for gynecologic cancer, PFDs, and prevalence. Any studies evaluating the prevalence of PFDs in gynecologic malignancies were included.
   A total of 550 articles met the designated search criteria and 31 articles were included in this review. In cervical cancer survivors, before treatment the prevalences of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and fecal incontinence (FI) were 24-29%, 8-18% and 6%, respectively, and after treatment the prevalences of SUI, UUI, urinary retention, FI, fecal urge, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were 4-76%, 4-59%, 0.4-39%, 2-34%, 3-49%, 12-58% and 15-47%, respectively. In uterine cancer survivors, before treatment the prevalences of SUI, UUI and FI were 29-36%, 15-25% and 3%, respectively, and after treatment the prevalences of urinary incontinence (UI) and dyspareunia were 2-44% and 7-39%, respectively. In vulvar cancer survivors, after treatment the prevalences of UI, SUI and FI were 4-32%, 6-20% and 1-20%, respectively. In ovarian cancer survivors, the prevalences of SUI, UUI, prolapse and sexual dysfunction were 32-42%, 15-39%, 17% and 62-75%, respectively.
   PFDs are prevalent in gynecologic cancer survivors and this is an important area of clinical concern and future research.

TI A critical review of the measurement of ice adhesion to solid substrates
SO PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES
AB Ice adhesion is an issue spanning a wide range of technical fields. In the aerospace industry, ice accretion has led to a large number of casualties and costs the industry billions of dollars every year. To design effective anti-/de-icing systems, the adhesion of ice to surfaces must be understood. In this review paper, the authors surveyed for papers providing methods for the measurement of ice adhesion. 113 papers were identified for comparison, with data being extracted from 58 papers with common test surfaces (aluminum, steel, Teflon (R) (Chemours), and polyurethane). The methods used were categorized and data were compared based on their precision and the trends they demonstrated. Conceptual problems were identified with the tests used in the literature and discussed, and open questions relevant to testing the adhesion of ice were identified. Several key parameters affecting ice adhesion identified from the literature were temperature, surface roughness, strain rate, and impact velocity. Their effects on adhesion strength were discussed. While researching this topic, it was discovered that many papers did not report the strain rate in their tests, and the vast majority of papers did not correct their data for stress concentrations on the surface, either of which has been shown to cause variation in the data by one order of magnitude. Data compared from the literature typically spanned one to three orders of magnitude. The causes of these variations were discussed.

TI A pilot data analysis of a metabolomic HPLC-MS/MS study of patients with
   COPD
SO ADVANCES IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Background. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition with multiple clinical faces. Metabolomic profiling studies small molecules present in biological samples by combined use of chromatography with mass spectrometry.
   Objectives. The goal of our work was to perform a high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic study to compare the concentrations of metabolites in COPD patients and in controls.
   Material and methods. Participants were recruited at the University Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic, with the approval of the ethics committee. The analysis of blood samples was performed at Health Sciences Center (HSC) in Kuwait. The blood samples were analyzed for concentrations of acylcarnitines and amino acids by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 2690 HPLC; Waters, Milford, USA) and a triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer (Quattro LC, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom).
   Results. Groups of 10 subjects with COPD and 10 healthy controls were analyzed. Carnitine analysis showed that the free carnitine to acylcarnitine ratio (CO/AC ratio) was significantly lower in COPD (0.58 mu M/L) compared to the controls (0.73 mu M/L; p = 0.002). The mean C8/C2 ratio in the COPD group was significantly higher (0.03 mu M/L) - in the control group it was 0 mu M/L (p = 0.03). Amino acid analysis showed lower levels of phenylalanine in the COPD group (22.05 mu M/L) compared to the controls (30.05 mu M/L; p = 0.008). The alanine concentrations were significantly lower in the COPD group (173 mu M/L) than in the control group (253 mu M/L; p = 0.001). The pyroglutamate levels were higher in COPD (1.58 mu M/L) than in the controls (1 mu M/L; p = 0.040).
   Conclusions. The carnitine and acylcarnitine levels in COPD subjects in this study possibly indicate a predisposition to atherosclerosis as a result of inadequate p-oxidation of fatty acids and show the presence of oxidative stress. Furthermore, the high sensitivity to changes in circulating amino acid levels may allow us to detect subclinical malnutrition and take early preventative interventions such as nutritional supplementation and patient education.

TI Heavy and standard silicone oil: intraocular inflammation
SO INTERNATIONAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose Proliferative vitreoretinopathy in the inferior retina remains clinically challenging. Heavier-than-water intraocular tamponades have been developed to improve inferior tamponading properties, and their chemical compositions have been substantially improved over the years, in parallel with developments in vitrectomy instrumentation and surgical techniques. Herein we present an updated review of the clinical use of standard formulations and HSO, focusing on analysis of the intraocular inflammation associated with endotamponade agents, and comparison of the adverse effects of these agents on the physical and biological properties of the eye.
   Methods A detailed literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar using the key words. Fifty-eight articles matched our inclusion criteria that were included in this systematic review.
   Results Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially fluorinated alkanes are associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rises in intraocular pressure, but these associations are not as strong when these substances are mixed with a heavy silicone oil (HSO). Two recently approved heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are now available for use in clinical practice. While the complication spectrum of the new generation of these HSOs seems to be similar to that of conventional silicone oil tamponades, they provide better support for the inferior retina and the posterior pole.
   Conclusion Both regular and heavy silicone oils usually yield good success rates in cases of complicated retinal detachment. Decisions as to whether to utilize heavy or regular silicone oil should be made on a case-by-case basis.

TI Metal-organic frameworks based on octafluorobiphenyl-4,4
   '-dicarboxylate: synthesis, crystal structure, and surface functionality
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB In contrast to aromatic carboxylates, the coordination polymers based on their perfluorinated analogues are not numerous. Here we present a series of six Zn(II) coordination polymers of different dimensionalities (1D, 2D, and 3D) and porosities based on octafluorobiphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate (oFBPDC(2-)) and N-containing co-ligands (ur, dabco, and bpy). These complexes are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, PXRD, FT-IR, elemental analysis, and TGA. The metal-organic frameworks [Zn-2(CH3CONH2)(2)(oFBPDC)(2)] (1) and [Zn-2(oFBPDC)(2)(dabco)] (4) are shown to be porous with BET surface areas of 470 m(2) g(-1) and 441 m(2) g(-1), respectively. In addition, compound 4 shows selectivity factors of 11.3, 4.9 and more than 6 for the binary gas mixtures CO2/N-2, CO2/CH4 and benzene/cyclohexane, respectively. The measurements for pressed powders and water droplet give water contact angles of 136 degrees for 4 and 133 degrees for (H(2)bpy)[Zn-2(bpy)(oFBPDC)(3)] (5). Low water uptake indicates that both 4 and 5 belong to highly hydrophobic solids.

TI Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy Alone for Patent Foramen Ovale in
   Patients With Cryptogenic Stroke A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
SO ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB Background: The optimal strategy for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) is unknown.
   Purpose: To compare transcatheter PFO closure with medical therapy alone for prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke.
   Data Sources: PubMed and the Cochrane Library (without language restrictions) from inception to October 2017, reference lists, and abstracts from cardiology meetings.
   Study Selection: Randomized trials enrolling adults with PFO and cryptogenic stroke that compared stroke outcomes (main outcome) and potential harms in those receiving transcatheter device closure versus medical therapy alone.
   Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted study data and rated risk of bias.
   Data Synthesis: Of 5 trials, 1 was excluded because it used a device that is no longer available due to high rates of complications and failure. Four high-quality trials enrolling 2892 patients showed that PFO closure decreased the absolute risk for recurrent stroke by 3.2% (risk difference, -0.032 [95% CI, -0.050 to -0.014]) compared with medical therapy. The treatment strategies did not differ in rates of transient ischemic attack or major bleeding. Closure of PFOs was associated with higher rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) than medical therapy alone in all trials, but this outcome had marked between-trial heterogeneity (I-2 = 82.5%), and high event rates in some groups resulted in extreme values for CIs.
   Limitation: Heterogeneity of device type and antithrombotic therapy across trials, small numbers for some outcomes, and heterogeneous and inconclusive AF results.
   Conclusion: In patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, transcatheter device closure decreases risk for recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone. Because recurrent stroke rates are low even with medical therapy alone and PFO closure might affect AF risk, shared decision making is crucial for this treatment.

TI Comparison of a twin interlocking derotation and compression screw
   cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) with a single screw derotation
   cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation): a systematic
   review and meta-analysis for intertrochanteric fractures
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB Background: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common and devastating injuries especially for the elderly. Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris Hip Score and intraoperative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported.
   Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with mean age of 77 years, and 64% of patients were female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13 to 0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09 to 0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34 to 0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris Hip Score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, whilst no difference in operating times were observed between the two devices.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin screw integrated cephalomedullary nail InterTAN is clinically more effective when compared to a single screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris Hip Score. Intraoperative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures.

TI Perfluorooctanoic acid and low birth weight: Estimates of US
   attributable burden and economic costs from 2003 through 2014
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Background and objective: In utero exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been associated with decreases in birth weight. We aimed to estimate the proportion of PFOA-attributable low birth weight (LBW) births and associated costs in the US from 2003 to 2014, a period during which there were industry-initiated and regulatory activities aimed at reducing exposure.
   Methods: Serum PFOA levels among women 18-49 years were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2003-2014; birth weight distributions were obtained from the Vital Statistics Natality Birth Data. The exposure-response relationship identified in a previous meta-analysis (18.9 g decrease in birth weight per 1 ng/mL of PFOA) was applied to quantify PFOA-attributable LBW (reference level of 3.1 ng/mL for our base case, 1 and 3.9 ng/mL for sensitivity analyses). Hospitalization costs and lost economic productivity were also estimated.
   Results: Serum PFOA levels remained approximately constant from 2003-2004 (median: 3.3 ng/mL) to 2007-2008 (3.5 ng/mL), and declined from 2009-2010 (2.8 ng/mL) to 2013-2014 (1.6 ng/mL). In 2003-2004, an estimated 12,764 LBW cases (4% of total for those years) were potentially preventable if PFOA exposure were reduced to the base case reference level (10,203 cases in 2009-2010 and 1,491 in 2013-2014). The total cost of PFOA-attributable LBW for 2003 through 2014 was estimated at $13.7 billion, with $2.97 billion in 2003-2004, $2.4 billion in 2009-2010 and $347 million in 2013-2014.
   Conclusions: Serum PFOA levels began to decline in women of childbearing age in 2009-2010. Declines were of a magnitude expected to meaningfully reduce the estimated incidence of PFOA-attributable LBW and associated costs.

AB Introduction: Associations between frailty and women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are not well understood. This study seeks to describe studies among women with PFD and the associated frailty assessments as recommended in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program/American Geriatric Society (ACS NSQIP/AGS) guidelines.
   Methods: This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) criteria are applied to assess study quality. Data synthesis is descriptive. Outcomes of interest include the ratio of studies adhering to the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines and evidence for frailty assessments versus usual care for women with PFDs.
   Results: Twenty studies regarding frailty and PFDs were included for systematic review. Studies were categorized as relating to (1) epidemiology, (2) frailty and incontinence, (3) postoperative morbidity, and (4) surgical choice. Most studies (5/20) did not define frailty or failed to follow the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines. All studies were of very low to low quality. Collectively, each category generated very low GRADE quality evidence of frailty and the relationship to PFDs.
   Conclusions: Most studies regarding frailty among women with PFDs did not define frailty as recommended in the ACS NSQIP/AGS guidelines. The evidence regarding PFDs and frailty is of very low quality. This is the first systematic review regarding frailty assessments specifically among women with PFDs. Paucity of data regarding frailty in women with PFDs, particularly with regard to surgical choice and surgical counseling, highlights the need for further study in this area.

TI Metabolomics Uncovers the Regulatory Pathway of Acyl-homoserine Lactones
   Based Quorum Sensing in Anammox Consortia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-mediated quorum sensing in bacterial communities have been extensively observed. However, the metabolic pathways regulated by AHLs in bacteria remain elusive. Here, we combined long-term reactor operation with microbiological and metabolomics analyses to explore the regulatory pathways for different AHLs in anammox consortia, which perform promising nitrogen removal for wastewater treatment. The results showed that no obvious shifts induced by exogenous AHLs occurred in the microbial community and, mainly, dosing AHLs induced changes in the metabolites. 3OC6-HSL, C6-HSL, and C8-HSL controlled the electron transport carriers that influence the bacterial activity. In contrast, only 3006-HSL regulated LysoPC(20:0) metabolism, which affected bacterial growth. AHLs mainly regulated the synthesis of the amino acids Ala, Val, and Glu and selectively regulated Asp and Leu to affect extracellular proteins. Simultaneously, all the AHLs regulated the ManNAc biosynthetic pathways, while OC6-HSL, OC8-HSL, and C6-HSL particularly enriched the UDP-G1cNAc pathway to promote exopolysaccharides, resulting in different aggregation levels of the anammox consortia. Our results not only provide the first metabolic insights into the means by which AHLs affect anammox consortia but also hint at potential strategies for overcoming the limitations of the long start-up period required for wastewater treatment by anammox processing.

TI Evaluation of digestion methods for analysis of trace metals in
   mammalian tissues and NIST 1577c
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Digestion techniques for ICP analysis have been poorly studied for biological samples. This report describes an optimized method for analysis of trace metals that can be used across a variety of sample types. Digestion methods were tested and optimized with the analysis of trace metals in cancerous as compared to normal tissue as the end goal. Anthropological, forensic, ontological and environmental research groups can employ this method reasonably cheaply and safely whilst still being able to compare between laboratories. We examined combined HNO3 and H2O2 digestion at 170 degrees C for human, porcine and bovine samples whether they are frozen, fresh or lyophilized powder. Little discrepancy is found between microwave digestion and PFA Teflon pressure vessels. The elements of interest (Cu, Zn, Fe and Ni) yielded consistently higher and more accurate values on standard reference material than samples heated to 75 degrees C or samples that utilized HNO3 alone. Use of H2SO4 does not improve homogeneity of the sample and lowers precision during ICP analysis. High temperature digestions ( > 165 degrees C) using a combination of HNO3 and H2O2 as outlined are proposed as a standard technique for all mammalian tissues, specifically, human tissues and yield greater than 300% higher values than samples digested at 75 degrees C regardless of the acid or acid combinations used. The proposed standardized technique is designed to accurately quantify potential discrepancies in metal loads between cancerous and healthy tissues and applies to numerous tissue studies requiring quick, effective and safe digestions.

TI Efficacy of fast track surgery in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for
   gastric cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Objective: To conduct a systematic review of efficacy and security of fast track surgery (FTS) in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Databases and supplemented by other searches to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the comparison of fast track surgery combined with laparoscopy versus laparoscopy separately used in radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer before December 2016. After screening for inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment, meta-analysis was conducted by the Review Manager 5.3 software.
   Results: A total of 6 RCTs, involving 464 patients, were included. There were 232 patients in the FTS group and conventional care group separately. Compared with the conventional care group, patients of FTS group had shorter postoperative hospital stay [WMD = -1.85, 95% CI: (-2.60, -1.11), P < .00001], earlier first flatus [WMD = -9.33, 95% CI: (-13.74, -4.91), P < .0001], lower level of C-reactive protein (CRP) at postoperative day 4 [WMD = -13.94, 95% CI: (-22.74, -5.15), P = .002], and less hospitalization fees [SMD = -1.12, 95% CI: (-2.07, -0.18), P = .02]. There were no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Based on current evidence, the FTS protocol is safe and effective in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Due to the limitations of our study, further larger and multicenter studies are needed to validate our findings.

TI Mode of action characterization for adverse effect of propranolol in
   Daphnia magna based on behavior and physiology monitoring and metabolite
   profiling
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Studies are underway to gather information about the mode of action (MOA) of emerging pollutants that could guide practical environmental decision making. Previously, we showed that propranolol, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, had adverse effects on Daphnia magna that were similar to its pharmaceutical action. In order to characterize the mode of action of propranolol in D. magna, which is suspected to be organ-specific pharmaceutical action or baseline toxicity, we performed time-series monitoring of behavior along with heart rate measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolite profiling. Principle component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to categorize the mode of action of propranolol among 5 chemicals with different modes of action. The findings showed that the mode of action of propranolol in D. magna is organ-specific and vastly different from those of narcotics, even though metabolite regulation is similar between narcotic and non-narcotic candidates. The method applied in this study seems applicable to rapid characterization of the MOA of other cardiovascular pharmaceutical ingredients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their
   precursors in the environment? A systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations.
   Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend.
   Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe.

TI Quantitative profiling of carbonyl metabolites directly in crude
   biological extracts using chemoselective tagging and nanoESI-FTMS
SO ANALYST
AB The extensive range of chemical structures, wide range of abundances, and chemical instability of metabolites present in the metabolome pose major analytical challenges that are difficult to address with existing technologies. To address these issues, one approach is to target a subset of metabolites that share a functional group, such as ketones and aldehydes, using chemoselective tagging. Here we report a greatly improved chemoselective method for the quantitative analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbonyl-containing metabolites directly in biological samples. This method is based on direct tissue or cells extraction with simultaneous derivatization of stable and labile carbonylated metabolites using N-[2-(aminooxy) ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecylammonium (QDA) and (CD3)-C-13 labeled QDA. We combined innovations of direct quenching of biological sample with frozen derivatization conditions under the catalyst N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, which facilitated the formation of oxime stable-isotope ion pairs differing by m/z 4.02188 while minimizing metabolite degradation. The resulting oximes were extracted by HyperSep C8 tips to remove interfering compounds, and the products were detected using nano-electrospray ionization interfaced with a Thermo Fusion mass spectrometer. The quaternary ammonium tagging greatly increased electrospray MS detection sensitivity and the signature ions pairs enabled simple identification of carbonyl compounds. The improved method showed the lower limits of quantification for carbonyl standards to be in the range of 0.20-2 nM, with linearity of R-2 > 0.99 over 4 orders of magnitude. We have applied the method to assign 66 carbonyls in mouse tumor tissues, many of which could not be assigned solely by accurate mass and tandem MS. Fourteen of the metabolites were quantified using authentic standards. We also demonstrated the suitability of this method for determining C-13 labeled isotopologues of carbonyl metabolites in C-13(6)-glucose-based stable isotope-resolved metabolomic (SIRM) studies.

TI Environmental chemicals and breast cancer: An updated review of
   epidemiological literature informed by biological mechanisms
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Many common environmental chemicals are mammary gland carcinogens in animal studies, activate relevant hormonal pathways, or enhance mammary gland susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging.
   Objective: For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development.
   Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006-2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles.
   Results: We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes.
   Conclusions: New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures.

AB Hydrocarbon liquid fuel (C8-C12) from poly propylene plastic waste has been successfully synthesized by catalytic conversion using Al-MCM-41 as catalyst. The Al-MCM-41 was characterized using SAXRD. Morphology of Al-MCM-41 surface was analyzed using TEM. The metals content were measured using XPS. The performance of Al-MCM-41 to adsorb and desorb nitrogen was monitored by GSA using BET model. The acidity of Al-MCM-41 was analyzed by FTIR by pyridine absorption method. Al-MCM-41 catalyst was used to convert polypropylene plastic waste in 200 mL catalytic convertion reactor. The Al-MCM-41 catalyst was used for three times and coded as sample A, B, and C. The results showed that sample A, B, and C produce hydrocarbon fraction (C8-C12) liquid fuel with a composition of 92.76; 91.92; and 90.58%, respectively. The repeated use of the catalyst causes a decrease in the composition of the hydrocarbon fraction (C8-C12) due to decrease of catalyst performance as observed by a TON (Turn Over Number) value which increased from 0.075%/gram to 0.156%/gram. Based on physical test i.e. boiling point, flash point, density, viscosity, and calorific value, it was proved that hydrocarbon fuels A, B and C have characteristics that in accordance with standard, premium gasoline, as specified in SNI 06-3506- 1994 and HIBER11Z international standards issued by Hibernia Petroleum Canada in 2016.

TI Environmental contaminants and preeclampsia: a systematic literature
   review
SO JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART B-CRITICAL REVIEWS
AB Preeclampsia is a medical condition specific to pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the woman's urine, indicating kidney damage. It is one of the most serious reproductive conditions, posing substantial risks to the baby and potentially fatal for the mother. The causes of preeclampsia are largely unknown and environmental contaminants merit further investigation. The aim of this review was to determine the association between environmental chemical exposures and preeclampsia. PubMed was searched for articles examining a priori chemical exposures and preeclampsia through April 2018. Studies were included in our review if they included at least 10 cases, evaluated preeclampsia independent of gestational hypertension, and used either measured or modeled exposure assessments. Our review contained 28 investigations examining persistent organic pollutants (POP) (6 studies), drinking water contaminants (1 study), atmospheric pollutants (11 studies), metals and metalloids (6 studies), and other environmental contaminants (4 studies). There were an insufficient number of investigations on most chemicals to draw definitive conclusions, but strong evidence existed for an association between preeclampsia and cadmium (Cd). There is suggestive evidence for associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM)(2.5), and traffic exposure with preeclampsia. There is evidence for an association between preeclampsia and Cd but insufficient literature to evaluate many other environmental chemicals. Additional studies using repeated measures, appropriate biological matrices, and mixtures methods are needed to expand this area of research and address the limitations of previous studies.

TI Systematic review of the literature on triclosan and health outcomes in
   humans
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB The ability of epidemiologic evidence to inform regulatory decisions is largely dependent on the coherence and quality of the published literature. This systematic review examines the quality and consistency of studies assessing health outcomes associated with exposure to triclosan (TCS), an antimicrobial chemical with a short physiologic half-life. We used elements of the Biomonitoring, Environmental Epidemiology, and Short-Lived Chemicals instrument to evaluate aspects of study quality. Each methodological domain - overall design, exposure assessment, and data analysis - was categorized according to three tiers where Tier 1 indicated the highest quality. We also examined consistency of methods, results and reporting as considerations for weight of evidence (WOE) assessment. Studies were considered sufficiently comparable if they addressed the same or similar research questions. Forty-two studies met the criteria for inclusion. Only one randomized cross-over clinical trial of TCS was assigned to Tier 1 for all three domains. Most other studies were assigned to Tier 3 for at least one domain. Although the available literature examined more than 100 different health endpoints and reported hundreds of different measures of association, few studies were considered comparable. For reported measures of association, most were not significantly different from the null; the few statistically significant results represented isolated findings without a discernable across- or within-study pattern. We conclude that the current body of epidemiologic literature does not allow a meaningful WOE assessment due to methodological limitations of individual studies and lack of inter-study consistency. On the other hand, methodologically stronger studies may be used to inform future research.

TI Antioxidant gene expression and metabolic responses of earthworms
   (Eisenia fetida) after exposure to various concentrations of
   hexabromocyclododecane
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), a ubiquitous suspected contaminant, is one of the world's most prominent brominated flame retardants (BFRs). In the present study, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to HBCD. The expression of selected antioxidant enzyme genes was measured, and the metabolic responses were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to identify the molecular mechanism of the antioxidant stress reaction and the metabolic reactions of earthworms to HBCD. A significant up-regulation (p <0.05) of superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene expression was detected, with the highest gene expression level of SOD appearing at a dose of 400 mg kg(-1) dw (2.06-fold, p<0.01). However, the glutathione transferase (GST) gene expression levels did not differ significantly (p>0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the metabolic responses showed that all groups could be clearly differentiated, and the highest concentration dose group was the most distant from the control group. Except for fumarate, the measured metabolites, which included adenosine triphosphate (ATP), valine, lysine, glycine, betaine and lactate, revealed significant (p < 0.05) increases after 14 days of exposure to HBCD. HBCD likely induces high levels of anaerobic respiration, which would result in high levels of ATP and lead to the disintegration of proteins into amino acids, including valine and lysine, to produce energy. The observed changes in osmotic pressure were indicative of damage to the membrane structure. Furthermore, this study showed that NMR-based metabolomics was a more sensitive tool than measuring the gene expression levels for elucidating the mode of toxicity of HBCD in earthworm exposure studies.

TI In vivo oxygen, temperature and pH dynamics in the female reproductive
   tract and their importance in human conception: a systematic review
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE
AB BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ART, implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer still remain low. IVF laboratories strive to ensure that the process of handling gametes in vitro closely mimics the in vivo environment. However, there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the in vivo regulation and dynamic variation in biophysical parameters such as oxygen concentration, pH and temperature within the reproductive tract.
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: To undertake a systematic review of the current understanding of the physico-chemical parameters of oxygen tension (pO(2)), pH and temperature within the female reproductive tract, and their potential implications in clinical and pathological processes related to fertility and those pertaining to limited reproductive capacity.
   SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Pubmed to identify original and review articles addressing the biophysical parameters (pO(2), pH and temperature) in the female reproductive tract of any species. The search included all studies published between 1946 and November 2015. Search terms included 'oxygen', 'pH', 'hydrogen ion concentration', 'acid base' and others terms. We also used special features and truncations to identify synonyms and broaden the search. Studies were excluded if they only assessed embryo culture conditions, fetal acid-base status, oxidative stress, outcomes of pregnancy and measurements of these parameters in non-reproductive organs.
   OUTCOMES: Our search generated 18 685 records and 60 articles were included. pO(2) within the female reproductive tract shows cyclical variation and minute-to-minute oscillations, which may be influenced by uterine contractility, hormones, the autonomic system, cardiac pulsatility, and myometrial and smooth muscle integrity. Fine balanced control of pO(2) and avoidance of overwhelming oxidative stress is crucial for embryogenesis and implantation. The pH in the female reproductive tract is graduated, with lowest pH in the vagina (similar to pH 4.42) increasing toward the Fallopian tubes (FTs) (similar to pH 7.94), reflecting variation in the site-specific microbiome and acid-base buffering at the tissue/cellular level. The temperature variation in humans is cyclical by day and month. In humans, it is biphasic, increasing in the luteal phase; with the caudal region of the oviduct 1-2 degrees cooler than the cranial portion. Temperature variation is influenced by hormones, density of pelvic/uterine vascular beds and effectiveness of heat exchange locally, crucial for sperm motility and embryo development. We have identified significant deficiencies and inconsistencies in the methods used to assess these biophysical factors within the reproductive tract. We have suggested that the technological solutions including the development of methods and models for real time, in vivo recordings of biophysical parameters.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The notion of 'back to nature' in assisted conception suggested 20 years ago has yet to be translated into clinical practice. While the findings from this systematic review do not provide evidence to change current in vitro protocols, it highlights our current inability to assess the in vivo reproductive tract environment in real time. Data made available through future development of sensing technology in utero may help to provide new insights into how best to optimize the in vitro embryo environment and allow for more precise and personalized fertility treatment.

TI Comparisons of internal fixation treatments for femoral
   intertrochanteric fractures: a network meta-analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Objective: To identify the optimal treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fracture through multiple comparisons of gamma nail (GN), sliding hip screw (SHS), proximal femoral nail (PFN), proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA), percutaneous compression plate (PCCP), and Targon proximal femoral (Targon PF). Methods: We searched the Embase and PubMed databases in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessment was performed using the recommendation of the Cochrane Collaboration. All outcomes were assessed using odds ratio, standardized mean difference, and 95% confidence interval. The random-effects model was used to examine all the outcomes. Node-splitting analysis and the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin method were applied for consistency test and convergence assessment, respectively. The Aggregate Data Drug Information System was used for the statistical analysis. Results: In total, 31 eligible studies were included. The multiple comparisons indicated that PFNA for blood loss and non-union, PCCP for operative time and mortality, SHS for embolism, intraoperative fracture and later fracture, and Targon PF for reoperation and wound infection were the optimal treatments. Rank probability showed that SHS was the best option for blood loss, embolism, intraoperative fracture, and later fracture; and Targon PF, for operative time, mortality, non-union, reoperation, and wound infection. The subgroup analysis revealed that blood loss, cut-out incidence, and wound infection were lowest and the operative time was shortest with the PFN. Conclusion: No optimal internal fixation treatment was identified for femoral intertrochanteric fracture, but PFN may be a better treatment option for unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures.

TI Retinal Toxicity of Medical Devices Used during Vitreoretinal Surgery: A
   Critical Overview
SO OPHTHALMOLOGICA
AB Retinal toxicity/biocompatibility of medical devices in direct contact with the retina is an important subject for clinicians and scientists. As these effects are not very frequent, there is also a relative lack of information for many clinicians. The past has taught us multiple times that there is a significant safety problem associated with severe loss of vision in affected patients. In this review, we want to classify medical products that are used in the back of the eye, describe recent examples of toxicity, critically reflect on the regulations that exist and suggest improvements that can be done to ensure patient safety without hindering innovation. Methods: Critical review of the recent papers and personal experience of the authors in this issue. Medical devices used in the back of the eye and recent examples of toxicity are described, regulations that exist are critically reflected and improvements suggested that can ensure patient safety without hindering innovation. Results: There is clear evidence of toxicity after intraocular surgery in any category. Some cytotoxic indirect methods have failed in detecting this toxicity. Some ISO rules do not seem appropriate. Postmarketing safety is missing. There is little data on this issue. Conclusions: The absence of a clear regulation of the production, purification and evaluation of the toxic effects of the medical devices supposes the possibility that products are not sufficiently safe to obtain the CE mark.

TI Differences in Sb(V) and As(V) adsorption onto a poorly crystalline
   phyllomanganate (delta-MnO2): Adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and
   mechanisms
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB The environmental behavior of antimony (Sb) in soils is often considered to be similar to that of arsenic (As). Comparing the adsorption behavior of these two elements on soil minerals is important because both elements coexist in contamination areas. In this study, the differences in antimonate (Sb(V)) and arsenate (As(V)) adsorption reaction kinetics and isotherm characteristics on a poorly crystalline phyllomanganate (delta-MnO2) were studied. The potential mechanisms were identified using zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The adsorption isotherm results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity for As(V) was 1.5 times higher than that for Sb(V). The adsorption kinetics of Sb(V) and As(V) were well fitted using pseudo-first-order model, and the adsorption rate of Sb(V) and As(V) significantly depended on delta-MnO2 dosage and pH. At all tested pH values (3.0-9.0), the adsorption rate of As(V) was 4.0-7.7 times faster than that of Sb(V) at the same delta-MnO2 dosage and pH conditions. FTIR and XPS analysis confirmed that M (metal)-O was bonded with Sb(V) and As(V). The adsorption capacity and rate of As(V) were significantly higher than those of Sb(V), suggesting that delta-MnO2 had higher affinity toward As(V). The different adsorption behaviors of Sb(V) and As(V) onto delta-MnO2 should be considered in soils. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Questionnaires to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction in the postpartum
   period: a systematic review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
AB Background: Pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) affect the female population, and the postpartum period can be related to the onset or aggravation of the disease. Early identification of the symptoms and the impact on quality of life can be achieved through assessment instruments.
   Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate questionnaires used to assess PFD in the postpartum period.
   Methods: A systematic review study was conducted, following Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, using the databases: PubMed, Biblioteca Virtual de Saude (BVS), Web of Science, and Scopus, and the keywords PFD or pelvic floor disorders, postpartum or puerperium, and questionnaire. Articles published up till May 2018 were included, searching for articles using validated questionnaires for the evaluation of PFDs in postpartum women. The articles included were evaluated according to a checklist, and the validation studies and translated versions of the questionnaires were identified.
   Results: The search of the databases resulted in 359 papers, and 33 were selected to compose this systematic review, using nine validated questionnaires to assess PFDs in the postpartum period: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS), Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 20 (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7), PFDI-46, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-31), Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire (PFBQ), Female Pelvic Floor Questionnaire, electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire - Pelvic Floor, and PFD questionnaire specific for pregnancy and postpartum. The most frequently reported questionnaires included PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, and ICIQ-VS and are recommended by ICI. In addition, the review identified a specific questionnaire, recently developed, to access PFD during pregnancy and postpartum.
   Conclusion: The questionnaires used to evaluate PFD during postpartum period are developed for general population or urology/gynecology patients with incontinence and reinforce the paucity of highly recommended questionnaires designed for postpartum, in order to improve early and specific approach for this period of life.

TI Empirical evidence in follow the Sun software development: A systematic
   mapping study
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Follow the Sun (FTS) development is a special case of Global Software Development. It is applied in the context of global projects to reduce the software development life-cycle duration. A number of studies have attempted to aggregate a better understanding of FTS development, but it is still an immature research area.
   Objective: This paper aims to investigate the existing empirical evidence about FTS research with a focus on identifying what research has been conducted in the area and which results have been obtained.
   Method: To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study to answer our research questions: "Which FTS studies have been published in the literature?" and "What empirical support is provided for them?" We investigated papers published between 1990 and 2017. The synthesis was made through classifying the papers into different categories (research topics, research methods, conferences and journals venues for FTS research, and countries involved in FTS research).
   Results: We selected 57 papers using a predefined search strategy. The majority of the papers discussing FTS were published in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE). The main research topic addressed is processes and organization development for FTS. Case studies combined with the interview as a research sub-method is adopted in the most studies performed in FTS. The majority of the existing research and the most active researchers in this topic are from the United States and Brazil. However, India and the United States are the countries that appear most often in the studies conducted to investigate FTS.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that FTS software development is an up-to-date research topic in Software Engineering. However, little information about FTS has been published over the last few years. The emergent need in this research is the development of evaluation research for testing FTS feasibility and effectiveness in practice. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Children's environmental health based on birth cohort studies of Asia
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Numerous studies have explored the associations between environmental pollutants and pediatric health. Recent studies have investigated the issue in Asia, but no systematic review has been published to date. This study aims to elucidate the issue by summarizing relevant epidemiologic evidence for cohorts in Asia, using information from the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA).
   Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health. Therefore, harmonization and international collaboration are also needed in Asia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Novel treatment technologies for PFAS compounds: A critical review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Perfluorinated compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have recently drawn great attention due to their wide distribution in aquatic environments. The understanding of the physicochemical properties and fate and transport of PFAs in groundwater is still limited. Preliminary studies indicate that these compounds can readily bioaccumulate and pose human and animal health concerns. Due to their physicochemical properties, PFOS and PFOA are water soluble, nonvolatile and persistent in the environment, which is a cause of concern related to their treatment with conventional remediation technologies. Extraction with inefficient carbon adsorption is one of the most common treatment technologies for remediation of PFOS- or PFOA-impacted groundwater. Several other innovative and promising technologies, including sonochemistry, bioremediation and photolysis, have been tested for their effectiveness in removal of perfluorinated compounds. This paper provides a baseline for understanding research needs to better develop treatment technologies for PFOA and PFOS in groundwater. Frontiers for improving the state of practice for PFOA and PFOS treatment include the development of more cost-effective ex situ treatment methods and the development and demonstration of promising in situ treatment technologies at the pilot and full scale.

TI Potential Effectiveness of Point-of-Use Filtration to Address Risks to
   Drinking Water in the United States
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS
AB Numerous contemporary incidents demonstrate that conventional control strategies for municipal tap water have limited ability to mitigate exposures to chemicals whose sources are within distribution systems, such as lead, and chemicals that are not removed by standard treatment technologies, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)/perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). In these situations, point-of-use (POU) controls may be effective in mitigating exposures and managing health risks of chemicals in drinking water, but their potential utility has not been extensively examined. As an initial effort to fill this information gap, we conducted a critical review and analysis of the existing literature and data on the effectiveness of POU drinking water treatment technologies for reducing chemical contaminants commonly found in tap water in the United States. We found that many types of water treatment devices available to consumers in the United States have undergone laboratory testing and often certification for removal of chemical contaminants in tap water, but in most cases their efficacy in actual use has yet to be well characterized. In addition, the few studies of POU devices while "in use" focus on traditional contaminants regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, but do not generally consider nontraditional contaminants of concern, such as certain novel human carcinogens, industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and flame retardants. Nevertheless, the limited information available at present suggests that POU devices can be highly effective when used prophylactically and when deployed in response to contamination incidents. Based on these findings, we identify future areas of research for assessing the ability of POU filters to reduce health-related chemical contaminants distributed through public water systems and private wells.

TI Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in intertrochanteric fractures: A
   meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials
SO MEDICINE
AB Background:This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients with intertrochanteric fractures.Methods:We conduct electronic searches of Medline (1966-2017.09), PubMed (1966-2017.09), Embase (1980-2017.09), ScienceDirect (1985-2017.09), and the Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are included. The quality assessments are performed according to the Cochrane systematic review method. Fixed/random-effect model is used according to the heterogeneity tested by I-2 statistic. Meta-analysis is performed using Stata 11.0 software.Results:A total of 4 RCTs are retrieved involving 514 participants. The present meta-analysis indicated that there were significant differences between groups in terms of total blood loss (weighted mean differences=-131.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): -163.63 to -99.35, P=.00), hemoglobin decline (weighted mean differences=-0.31, 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.19, P=.00), and transfusion rate (risk differences=-1.11, 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.04, P=.00). In addition, no increased risk of adverse effects was identified in both groups.Conclusion:Local administration of tranexamic acid is associated with a reduced total blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin decline, and transfusion requirements in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. High-quality RCTs are still required for further investigation.

TI Modeling of Catalytic Fixed-Bed Reactors for Fuels Production by
   Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB A comprehensive review of the various studies reported in the literature to date on the mathematical modeling of fixed-bed reactors for the production of fuels by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was carried out. It is quite clear that most of the proposed models are based on a set of assumptions that allow their wide simplification by reducing the models into forms of low complexity, due to the fact that in most cases the effects of phase equilibrium are neglected, and relatively simple Fischer-Tropsch kinetics of the power law type are used. In addition, most of the proposed modeling schemes neglect the effects of resistances to gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer. On the other hand, few reports consider the energy effects under the consideration of a nonisothermal operation assuming a plug-flow behavior and a gas-liquid system. A generalized model of a fixed-bed FTS reactor is proposed which takes into account all the mass and heat transfer phenomena, as well as hydrodynamics and vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE), based on the information given in the literature. It is evident that for fixed-bed reactors for fuel production using Fischer-Tropsch technology, there is little experimental information for validation and a need to explore different types of reactor models, such as reactor models under a trickle-flow regime considering the effects of phase distribution and dispersion under transient-state conditions.

TI Multiple-stressor effects in an apex predator: combined influence of
   pollutants and sea ice decline on lipid metabolism in polar bears
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB There is growing evidence from experimental and human epidemiological studies that many pollutants can disrupt lipid metabolism. In Arctic wildlife, the occurrence of such compounds could have serious consequences for seasonal feeders. We set out to study whether organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) could cause disruption of energy metabolism in female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway (n = 112). We analyzed biomarkers of energy metabolism including the abundance profiles of nine lipid-related genes, fatty acid (FA) synthesis and elongation indices in adipose tissue, and concentrations of lipid-related variables in plasma (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides). Furthermore, the plasma metabolome and lipidome were characterized by low molecular weight metabolites and lipid fingerprinting, respectively. Polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes, brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances were significantly related to biomarkers involved in lipid accumulation, FA metabolism, insulin utilization, and cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, the effects of pollutants were measurable at the metabolome and lipidome levels. Our results indicate that several OHCs affect lipid biosynthesis and catabolism in female polar bears. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when combined with reduced sea ice extent and thickness, suggesting that climate-driven sea ice decline and OHCs have synergistic negative effects on polar bears.

TI Influence of enhanced recovery after surgery programs on
   laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy for gastric cancer: a systematic review
   and meta-analysis of randomized control trials
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background: This meta-analysis is aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs in gastric cancer patients undergoing laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG).
   Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized control trials involving either enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)/fast track surgery (FTS) for patients underwent LAG. EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of science, and Cochrane Library were searched. Primary outcomes included the length of postoperative hospital stay, cost of hospitalization, postoperative complications, and readmission rate.
   Results: Five randomized control trials were eligible for analysis. There were 159 cases in FTS group and 156 cases in conventional care group. Compared with conventional care group, FTS group relates to shorter postoperative hospital stay (WMD-2.16; 95% CI-3.05 to-1.26, P < 0.00001), less cost of hospitalization (WMD-4.72; 95% CI-6.88 to-2.55, P < 0.00001), shorter time to first flatus (WMD-9.72; 95% CI-13.75 to-5.81, P < 0.00001), lower level of C-reaction protein on postoperative days 3 or 4 (WMD-19.66; 95% CI-28.98 to-10.34, P < 0.00001), higher level of albumin on postoperative day 4 (WMD 3.45; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.89, P < 0.00001), and postoperative day 7 (WMD 5.63; 95% CI 1.01 to 10.24, P = 0.02). Regarding postoperative complications, no significant differences were observed between FTS group and conventional care group (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.09, P = 0.10). The readmission rate of FTS group was comparable to conventional care group (WMD 3.14; 95% CI 0.12 to 81.35, P = 0.49).
   Conclusions: Among patients undergoing LAG, FTS is associated with shorter postoperative hospital stay, rapid postoperative recovery, and decreased cost without increasing complications or readmission rate. The combined effects of the two methods could further accelerate clinical recovery of gastric cancer patients.

TI Comparison of clinical outcomes with InterTan vs Gamma nail or PFNA in
   the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures: A meta-analysis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Intertrochanteric fractures are common injuries in the elderly. Conventional intramedullary nails including Gamma 3 locking nail and proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) were designed for unstable intertrochanteric fractures. The InterTan (IT) nail system, introduced in 2005, has been reported superior biomechanical and clinical outcomes compared with 1-screw nailing system. However, some recent studies have reported that IT did not improve functional recovery in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or prospective cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis. We used the PRISMA guidelines and Cochrane Handbook to evaluate the quality of included studies to ensure that the pooled data of our meta-analysis were reliable and veritable. Our pooled data analysis demonstrated that IT was as effective as the control group in terms of Harris Hip Score (HHS), blood loss, total complications, union time, length of hospital stay, revision rate, and fluoroscopy time. IT shows less implant cut-out rate and femoral fractures when compared with control groups.

TI Photocatalytic degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane
   sulfonate in water: A critical review
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are persistent organic pollutants in the environment and have serious health risks, including endocrine disrupting properties, immunotoxicity and developmental effects etc. The photochemical degradation has been proven to be a low-cost, efficient and sustainable technology for the removal of PFOX (X = A or S) in water. At present, most of the investigations have been conducted in ultrapure water and at concentrations much higher comparing to those detected in the real wastewaters. Furthermore, there are few studies about the toxicity of treated water. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the photocatalytic degradation of PFOX, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared with photooxidation, photo-reduction appears to be more suitable for the PFOX removal since it is more favorable for the defluorination of PFOX and further complete mineralization. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination process of PFOX are commendably accessed, such as light wavelength, photocatalyst concentration, initial PFOX concentration, pH, reaction atmosphere, temperature, and coexisting organic or inorganic matters. The mechanisms of PFOX photodegradation process are also elucidated in detail. This paper will help to deeply understand PFOX decomposition process and put forward better perspectives in the future for researchers who work in this field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Short-term Peripheral Venous Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections: A
   Systematic Review
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Short-term peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) are commonly used in healthcare settings. To determine the magnitude of bloodstream infections (BSIs) related to their use, PubMed, article bibliographies, and the authors' library were searched for pertinent articles. The incidence of PVC-related BSIs was 0.18% among 85063 PVCs. Short-term PVCs accounted for a mean of 6.3% and 23% of nosocomial BSIs and nosocomial catheter-related BSIs, respectively. Prolonged dwell time and catheter insertion under emergent conditions increased risk of PVC-related bloodstream infection (PVCR-BSI). If approximately 200 million PVCs are successfully inserted into adult patients each year in the United States, there may be many PVCR-BSIs occurring yearly. Clinicians should obtain blood cultures in patients with evidence of PVC infection and systemic symptomatology such as fever, carefully inspect the PVC insertion site in bacteremic or fungemic patients, and remove PVCs associated with localized infection with or without associated BSI.

TI Bringing Value-Based Perspectives to Care: Including Patient and Family
   Members in Decision-Making Processes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Recent evidence shows that patient engagement is an important strategy in achieving a high performing healthcare system. While there is considerable evidence of implementation initiatives in direct care context, there is limited investigation of implementation initiatives in decision-making context as it relates to program planning, service delivery and developing policies. Research has also shown a gap in consistent application of system-level strategies that can effectively translate organizational policies around patient and family engagement into practice.
   Methods: The broad objective of this initiative was to develop a system-level implementation strategy to include patient and family advisors (PFAs) at decision-making points in primary healthcare (PHC) based on well-established evidence and literature. In this opportunity sponsored by the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement (CFHI) a co-design methodology, also well-established was applied in identifying and developing a suitable implementation strategy to engage PFAs as members of quality teams in PHC. Diabetes management centres (DMCs) was selected as the pilot site to develop the strategy. Key steps in the process included review of evidence, review of the current state in PHC through engagement of key stakeholders and a co-design approach.
   Results: The project team included a diverse representation of members from the PHC system including patient advisors, DMC team members, system leads, providers, Public Engagement team members and CFHI improvement coaches. Key outcomes of this 18-month long initiative included development of a working definition of patient and family engagement, development of a Patient and Family Engagement Resource Guide and evaluation of the resource guide.
   Conclusion: This novel initiative provided us an opportunity to develop a supportive system-wide implementation plan and a strategy to include PFAs in decision-making processes in PHC. The well-established co-design methodology further allowed us to include value-based (customer driven quality and experience of care) perspectives of several important stakeholders including patient advisors. The next step will be to implement the strategy within DMCs, spread the strategy PHC, both locally and provincially with a focus on sustainability.

TI Adsorption of emerging pollutants on activated carbon
SO REVIEWS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Many emerging pollutants (also known as micropollutants) including pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have frequently been detected in surface, ground, and drinking water at alarming concentrations. The emission and accumulation of these anthropogenic chemicals in nature is a potential threat to human health and aquatic environment. Therefore, it is essential to devise an effective and feasible technology to remove the micro-pollutants from water. Activated carbon adsorption has been introduced and utilized as a promising treatment to reduce the concentration of the emerging pollutants in water. A summary of research on the removal of pesticides, PPCPs, and EDCs by activated carbon adsorption process is presented in this report. The effects of carbon characteristics, adsorptive properties, and environmental factors on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon are reviewed. In addition, the mechanisms of the adsorption including hydrophobicity and the nature of the functional groups of activated carbon and organic compounds are discussed. Furthermore, the applied equilibrium adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, BET, Sips, DubininAstakhov, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Toth) and the most common kinetic models (pseudo-first-and second-order models, film and intra-particle diffusion models, and adsorption-desorption model) are also included for further investigation. This comprehensive review report aims to identify the knowledge deficiencies regarding emerging pollutant treatment via activated carbon adsorption process and open new horizons for the future research on the adsorption of emerging pollutants on activated carbon.

TI Updates in the Evaluation of Older Women with Pelvic Floor Disorders
SO CURRENT GERIATRICS REPORTS
AB Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are common among older women, and pose a unique challenge to the healthcare provider. The onset of PFDs in older women is gradual resulting from an inter-related process of anatomic, hormonal, and functional changes that occur over time and often impacted by concomitant medical co-morbid conditions. In this evidenced-based review, we provide an update on the epidemiology and provide an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of women with PFDs with a specific focus on the impact of aging.
   Physical function impairment is prevalent among older women with pelvic floor symptoms. The decline in physical function is likely the consequence of global changes in skeletal muscle health with aging, but may uniquely impact the pelvic floor muscle physiology and function.
   Providers caring for older women with PFDs must account for the impact of the aging process on symptom presentation and evaluation.

TI Soil ecotoxicity of seven endocrine-disrupting chemicals: a review
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widely used in manufacturing, and they enter the soil by direct and indirect pathways. Thus, there are concerns about their potential effects on soil ecosystems and some studies have monitored EDCs in the soil environment. However, there have been few studies on soil ecotoxicity of EDCs so far compared with aquatic ecotoxicity, and there is no comprehensive review of soil ecotoxicity of EDCs. Therefore, we collected, compiled and reviewed 77 studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven prominent EDCs: bisphenol A, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenols, triclosan, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS). This review brings together the data on soil ecotoxicity and research trends for these seven EDCs and identifies the need for further research to fill the gaps in our knowledge and data.
   Highlights
   Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) pose potential threats to soil ecosystems.
   Seventy-seven studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven EDCs were reviewed.
   There are fewer studies on soil ecotoxicity than on aquatic ecotoxicity.
   Further research including various environmentally relevant concentrations of EDCs is needed.

TI Diagnostics of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in pediatrics.
   Recommendations for the practice according to the S3 guidelines
SO MONATSSCHRIFT KINDERHEILKUNDE
AB Intrauterine alcohol exposure can lead to toxic damage to the fetal brain and therefore to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The estimated prevalence in Germany is 1 % and FASD persists for life. Not only pediatricians and child psychiatrists but also general practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and gynecologists (plus broad areas of pedagogics and social work) are confronted with FASD.
   Based on a systematic review and methodological assessment of the literature from 2001-2015, the multidisciplinary guideline group formulated consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD. In this publication the differential diagnostic criteria for partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) are presented.
   The literature search for pFAS, ARND and ARBD resulted in 365 hits and 58 publications were included for the methodological assessment. For the diagnosis of pFAS, two out of three facial anomalies (i.e. short palpebral fissure length, thin upper lip and smooth philtrum), at least three abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) and a probable maternal alcohol consumption are required. For the diagnosis of ARND at least three abnormalities of the CNS and a confirmed intrauterine alcohol exposure are necessary. The ARBD is rejected as a separate diagnosis.
   Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD that are easily implemented in practice were defined. Regarding treatment and secondary prevention of complications, more research is necessary.
