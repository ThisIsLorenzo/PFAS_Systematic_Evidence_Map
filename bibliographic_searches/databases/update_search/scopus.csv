Multiple PFAS are associated with adverse liver outcomes in adult humans and toxicological models, but effects on the developing liver are not fully described. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5–17.5 to PFOA (0, 1, or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg GenX (R2: 0.46–0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups in fetal liver (R2: 0.59–0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69, maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism. Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated &gt; 1000 maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative liver weight (R2 &gt;0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1 mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver to these chemical stressors. This work helps define mechanisms of hepatic toxicity of two structurally unique PFAS and may help predict latent consequences of developmental exposure. © 2022","disease; maternal health; organofluorine; pollution exposure; pregnancy; rodent; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; oxide; perfluorooctanoic acid; polymer; adult; animal; female; fetus; human; mouse; pregnancy; Adult; Animals; Caprylates; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Mice; Oxides; Polymers; Pregnancy"

They are used in a wide array of products and are found in living organisms around the world. Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 μg/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies have been performed on secondary consumers and there is a substantial lack of studies on other consumers in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic environments; Exposure effects; Health effects; Meta-analysis; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Secondary consumers; Substance concentrations; Synthetic chemicals; Systematic Review; Trophic level; Aquatic organisms; cancer; concentration (composition); endocrine disruptor; meta-analysis; toxicity; trophic level; aquatic environment; aquatic species; body size; consumer; controlled study; environmental exposure; fertility; gonad; human; liver; meta analysis; nonhuman; review; systematic review; trophic level; aquatic species; ecosystem; fluorocarbon; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons"

Howbeit, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C–C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carboxylation; Catalysis; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Advanced Oxidation Processes; AOP; Critical review; Defluorination; Degradation pathways; Head groups; Oxidation and reduction; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFOA; Reduction process; Electrochemical oxidation"

Ever since perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were recognized by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the public has become increasingly concerned about potential contamination and the environmental risks associated with PFASs. Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes. © 2022 by the authors.","benthos; bioaccumulation; feasibility study; food chain; food web; microorganism; polymer; toxicity; zooplankton; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; analysis; animal; aquatic species; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; invertebrate; plankton; toxicity; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Drinking Water; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Invertebrates; Plankton; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The recalcitrant behavior of PFAS to most traditional water treatment processes calls for development of novel or modified treatment approaches for effective PFAS elimination. Currently, high-pressure membrane systems, including nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are among the most promising and readily applied technologies for PFAS removal. In this review, we summarized peer-reviewed scientific articles on the development and use of 20 different types of commercial and 6 synthesized/modified NF and RO membranes in terms of PFAS removal efficacy. Synthesizing of existing knowledge shows that under environmentally relevant pH and concentration, NF and RO can effectively remove PFAS from water. The impact of PFAS molecular weight (MW) and functionality, membrane characteristics, feed water constitution, natural organic matters and operational conditions were systematically reviewed and evaluated. Moving forward, we recommend additional research dedicated to understanding the behaviors of PFAS alternatives and other overlooked compounds (e.g., PFAS with chain length C2 and C3) during NF and RO processes. Further, it is critical to develop or optimize existing membrane products with strong selectivity for specific PFAS species, while being resistant to fouling. Overall, this review is expected to assist researchers and water quality managers investigating membrane processes for PFAS removal. © 2022","Microfiltration; Nanofiltration membranes; Osmosis membranes; Reverse osmosis; Water filtration; Water quality; Water treatment; Aquatic environments; Critical review; Human exposures; Membrane filtrations; Membrane process; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substance removal; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Reverse osmosis membrane; Nanofiltration"

The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on ‘Late Lessons from Early Warnings’ (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency – Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public’s health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of “actionable evidence,” that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents. The recommendations are applicable to policy and regulatory settings at the local, state, federal and international levels. © 2022, The Author(s).","chemical compound; environmental justice; health risk; public health; risk factor; education; human; Internet; medical informatics; uncertainty; Education; Humans; Internet; Medical Informatics; Uncertainty"

In the present study, PPs have been considered one of the emerging pollutants (EPs) and a cause of concern in river health assessment. Beyond the reported increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ABRB), PPs have been found adversely affecting the biotic diversity in such water environments. Considering Algae, Macroinvertebrates, and Fishes as three distinct trophic level indicators, the present study puts forward a framework for showing River Health Condition (RHC) based on the calculation of a River Health Index (RHI). The RHI is calculated using six Indicator Group Scores (IGS) which individually reflect river health in a defined category of water quality characteristics. While Dissolved Oxygen Related Parameters (DORP), Nutrients (NT), and PPs are taken as causative agents affecting RHCs, scores of Algal-Bacterial (AB) symbiosis, Macroinvertebrates (MI), and Fishes (F) are considered as an effect of such environmental conditions. Current wastewater treatment technologies are also not very effective in the removal of PPs. The objective of the present study is to review the harmful effects of PPs on the aquatic environment, particularly on the chemical and biotic indicators of river health. Based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in the aquatic environment and measured environmental concentration (MEC) in the river, the estimated risk quotient (RQ) for norfloxacin in the Isakavagu-Nakkavagu stream of river Godavari, Hyderabad is found 293 for algae, 39 for MI, and 335 for fish. Among PPs, in Indian rivers, the presence of caffeine is the most frequent, with algae at the highest level of risk (RQmax= 24.5). Broadly six PPs, including azithromycin, caffeine, diclofenac, naproxen, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole are found above PNEC values in Indian rivers. The application of IGS and RHI in understanding and presenting the river health condition (RHC) through colored hexagons has been demonstrated for the river Ganga near Varanasi (India) as an example. Identification of critical indicator groups, based on IGS provides a scientific basis for planned intervention for river health restoration to achieve an acceptable category. © 2022","amoxicillin; amphetamine; ampicillin; anticonvulsive agent; azithromycin; caffeine; carbamazepine; central stimulant agent; ciprofloxacin; diclofenac; dissolved oxygen; hydrogen peroxide; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; paracetamol; sparfloxacin; sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim; drug; alga; antibiotic resistance; aquatic environment; dissolved oxygen; drug; fish; macroinvertebrate; manufacturing; nutrient; pollutant; river pollution; wastewater; Advanced Oxidation Process; alcohol withdrawal syndrome; Algae Berger Parker index; antibiotic resistance bacteria; antibiotic resistant bacteria; aquaculture; backache; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; bipolar disorder; calculation; conceptual framework; controlled study; conventional activated sludge; depression; dissociation constant; dissolved oxygen related parameter; drug manufacture; electric conductivity; emerging pollutant; environmental risk; estimated risk quotient; fever; fish; Fish Berger Parker index; headache; Health Assessment Questionnaire; hospital wastewater; Indicator Group Score; macroinvertebrate; mania; measured environmental concentration; nonhuman; nutrient; pain; pharmaceutical care; pharmaceutical pollutant; photodegradation; predicted no effect concentration; removal efficiency; Review; Risk Quotient; river health; river health condition; River Health Index; sludge; solids retention time; symbiosis; tooth pain; turnover rate; volatilization; waste water management; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; animal; pollutant; river; Godavari River; India; Animals; Caffeine; Environmental Pollutants; Norfloxacin; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Rivers"

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations. Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking.

Among these, carbon materials and biofilms, as environmentally friendly functional materials, have been widely applied for immobilisation because of their abundant sources and favorable growth conditions for microorganisms. The novel covalent organic framework (COF) could also be a new immobilisation material, due to its easy preparation and high performance. Different immobilisation methods were used to determine the relationship between carriers and microorganisms. Co-immobilisation is particularly important because it can compensate for the deficiencies of a single immobilisation method. This paper emphasises that impact conditions also affect the immobilisation effect and function. In addition to temperature and pH, the media conditions during the preparation and reaction of materials also play a role. Additionally, this study mainly reviews the applications and mechanisms of immobilised microorganisms in environmental remediation. Future development of immobilisation technology should focus on the discovery of novel and environmentally friendly carrier materials, as well as the establishment of optimal immobilisation conditions for microorganisms. This review intends to provide references for the development of immobilisation technology in environmental applications and to further the improve understanding of immobilisation technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemistry; Environmental technology; Functional materials; Carrier material; Condition; Eco-friendly; Environmental remediation; External interference; Immobilisation; Immobilization method; Immobilized microorganism; Microbial remediation; Microbial technology; Microorganisms; carbon; covalent organic framework; dye; environmental chemical; extracellular polymeric substance; heavy metal; metal nanoparticle; microplastic; natural product; perfluoro compound; pesticide; petroleum derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; polyfluorinated compound; polymer; radioisotope; surfactant; unclassified drug; metal organic framework; biofilm; carbon; environmental technology; immobilization; microbial activity; microorganism; remediation; biofilm; concentration (parameter); conformation; cost; ecosystem restoration; environmental impact; environmental temperature; immobilization; microbial activity; microbial growth; microbial technology; pH; Review; technology; waste component removal; technology; Carbon; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Technology"

We examined individual and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on metabolic disorders. Methods: We analyzed data from participants aged 20–74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results: Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5% (95%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada’s physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6% (95%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2% change; 95%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2% change; 95%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5% change; 95%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5% higher; 95%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7% higher; 95%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8% higher; 95%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion: Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA – both individually and as a mixture – were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the hepatotoxic effects of PFAS. © 2022, The Author(s).","biomarker; biomonitoring; body mass; chemical pollutant; chemical substance; epidemiology; health survey; individual variation; metabolism; phosphatase; physical activity; Canada; bilirubin; biological marker; fluorocarbon; adult; Canada; epidemiology; human; liver; Adult; Bilirubin; Biomarkers; Canada; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Liver"

Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. Methods: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects—mainly from a patient-perspective. Results: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results. © 2022, The Author(s).","teratogenic agent; Article; chromosome aberration; comparative effectiveness; false negative result; false positive result; female; first trimester pregnancy; genetic susceptibility; gestational age; human; meta analysis; noninvasive prenatal testing; positivity rate; predictive value; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal diagnosis; prenatal screening; sensitivity and specificity; spontaneous abortion; teratogenesis; trisomy 13; trisomy 21"

Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single-screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris hip score and intra-operative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with a mean age of 77 years and 64% of patients being female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13–0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09–0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34–0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris hip score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, while no difference in operating times was observed between the two devices. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) is clinically more effective when compared to a single-screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris hip score. Intra-operative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage.

The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. Results: From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery. Conclusions: PFN(A) resulted in a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss compared to DHS. However, no difference was seen for postoperative complications.

It underlies various complications and imposes many costs on individuals and society. Discovering early diagnostic biomarkers takes excellent insight into preventive plans and the best use of interventions. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the level of amino acids and acylcarnitines and diabetes to develop diabetes predictive models. Using the targeted LC–MS/MS technique, we analyzed fasting plasma samples of 206 cases and 206 controls that were matched by age, sex, and BMI. The association between metabolites and diabetes was evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and lipid profile. To deal with multiple comparisons, factor analysis was used. Participants' average age and BMI were 61.6 years, 28.9 kg/m2, and 55% were female. After adjustment, Factor 3 (tyrosine, valine, leucine, methionine, tryptophan, phenylalanine), 5 (C3DC, C5, C5OH, C5:1), 6 (C14OH, C16OH, C18OH, C18:1OH), 8 (C2, C4OH, C8:1), 10 (alanine, proline) and 11 (glutamic acid, C18:2OH) were positively associated with diabetes. Inline, factor 9 (C4DC, serine, glycine, threonine) and 12 (citrulline, ornithine) showed a reverse trend.

Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case–control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00-–1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15–1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03–1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02–1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91–1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00–1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02–1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00–1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.

Impacted residents and their healthcare providers often turn to federal and state agency webpages, fact sheets, and other documents to weigh exposure risks and interventions. Main body: This commentary briefly reviews scientific evidence concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) for health outcomes that concern members of affected communities and that have compelling or substantial yet differing degree of scientific evidence. It then features official documents in their own language to illustrate communication gaps, as well as divergence from scientific evidence and from best health communication practice. We found official health communications mostly do not distinguish between the needs of heavily contaminated communities characterized by high body burdens and the larger population with ubiquitous but substantially smaller exposures. Most health communications do not distinguish levels of evidence for health outcomes and overemphasize uncertainty, dismissing legitimate reasons for concern in affected communities. Critically, few emphasize helpful approaches to interventions. We also provide examples that can be templates for improvement.

Most of these products contain traces of widespread chemicals, usually known as emerging pollutants (EPs) or pollutants of emerging concern (PEC). The Latin American (LA) region comprises 20 countries with different social and cultural aspects, with 81 % of the population living in urban areas. The LA region has some countries on the top list of users/consumers of EPs, from pesticides and fertilizers to personal care products. However, there is a gap in information related to the distribution of EPs in the environment of this region, with very few existing review texts exploring this issue. Therefore, this present paper advances this approach. An exhaustive literature review, with the selection of 176 documents, provided unique up-to-date information on the presence/distribution of 17 classes of legacy or emerging pollutants in different food and environmental matrices (soil, sediment, water, and air). The study shows that the wide distribution and recorded levels of these pollutants in the continental environment are potential risks to human health, mainly through food and drinking water ingestion. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are pollutants of deep public concern since they show carcinogenic properties. Several classes of pollutants, like endocrine disruptors, have caused harmful effects on humans and the environment.

CO2, being a major component of greenhouse gases, draws more attention towards carbon capture and utilization (CCU) into energy rich products. Among all the CCU products, higher hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers are more desirable than low carbon-based products due to their featuring high energy density and minimal emissions. In this context, major advancements are being achieved in the production of fuels and fuel additives like ethanol, ethylene, ethane, dimethyl ether, light olefins (C2–C4 olefins), jet fuels (C8–C16 alkanes and cycloalkanes), aromatic products, etc. from CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Hence, it is imperative to compile and analyze its important features regarding catalyst environment, mechanistic insights, conversion efficiency, product selectivity and so on from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In our review, we comprehensively evaluate the developments towards promoting CO2 hydrogenation to high carbon-based products. We intend to present the possible schemes, current challenges, and the expected future research pathways towards designing efficient catalytic systems for CO2 reduction reaction.

However, the microbial response mechanism under chronic effects of BACs on acidogenesis and methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion (AD) has not been clearly disclosed. This study investigated the AD (by-)products and microbial evolution under low to high BACs concentrations from bioreactor startup to steady running. It was found that BACs can lead to an increase of WAS hydrolysis and fermentation, but a disturbance to acidogenic bacteria also occurred at low BACs concentration. A noticeable inhibition to methanogenesis occurred when BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g TSS.

Therefore, it is urgent to apply methods for the detection and removal of these pollutants. Given that antibiotics cannot be completely removed by conventional methods, developing alternative methods to enhance their removal efficiency should be the focus of researchers. Over the past decades, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained considerable attention owing to their remarkable merits (high surface area, low density and high thermal conductivity). However, despite the numerous advantages of CNTs, they suffer from some limitations, which can be solved by surface modification. Hence, this comprehensive review aims to help readers to improve their fundamental knowledge regarding the main characteristics of common antibiotics and their environmental and health effects, their fate in the environment, common methods for their removal, physicochemical methods for the modification of CNTs, identifying the effects of various parameters (pH, dosage, initial concentration, and time) on the removal process, and the reusability and major mechanism for the adsorption of antibiotics by CNTs. Finally, we summarize the isotherm and kinetic models for the removal of antibiotics. Our results exhibit that all the data fitted the Langmuir isotherm model, which reveals that the adsorption process on modified-CNTs is homogenous and monolayer. Furthermore, herein, the adsorption kinetics is well described by the pseudo-second-order model. Overall, this review provides useful insight for young researchers to understand the adsorption of antibiotics and achieve the future goal of using CNTs as promising adsorbents. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Adsorption; Carbon nanotubes; Isotherms; Monolayers; Reusability; Water pollution; Bio-accumulation; Carbon nanotube synthesis; Conventional methods; Emerging pollutants; Future challenges; Human environment; Human lives; Performance challenges; Property; Water and wastewater; Antibiotics; antibiotics; carbon nanotube; future prospect; performance assessment; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; water treatment"

The primary sources of CECs in farmlands are agricultural inputs, such as wastewater, biosolids, sewage sludge, and agricultural mulching films. The percent increase in cropland area during 1950-2016 was 30 and the rise in land use for food crops during 1960-2018 was 100-500%, implying that there could be a significant CEC burden in farmlands in the future. In fact, the alarming concentrations (μg kg−1) of certain CECs such as PBDEs, PAEs, and PFOS that occur in farmlands are 383, 35 400 and 483, respectively. Also, metal nanoparticles are reported even at the mg kg−1 level. Chronic root accumulation followed by translocation of CECs into plants results in their detectable concentrations in the final plant produce. Thus, there is a continuous flow of CECs from farmlands to agricultural produce, causing a serious threat to the terrestrial food chain. Consequently, CECs find their way to the human body directly through CEC-laden plant produce or indirectly via the meat of grazing animals. Thus, human health could be at the most critical risk since several CECs have been shown to cause cancers, disruption of endocrine and cognitive systems, maternal-foetal transfer, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity.

These emerging pollutants cause several hazardous health issues to humans, animals, and the ecosystem. Conventional treatment methodology faces different issues in the recognition and removal of toxins, such as expense, facile operation conditions, and the prerequisite of high maintenance. To overcome this issue, adsorption is viewed as one of the most encouraging innovations for the removal of pollutants. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered to be efficiently adsorbent, because of their porosity, high surface area, fine-Tunable metal clusters, and easy functional surface engineering properties. This Review concerns the recent examinations on MOFs as proficient material in the removal of toxic contaminants from wastewater.

In AOPs, different types of free radicals (HO·, SO4·−, O2·−, etc.) are generated to decompose PPCPs into non-toxic and small-molecule compounds, finally leading to the decomposition of PPCPs. This review systematically summarizes the features of various AOPs and the removal of PPCPs by different free radicals.

Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic homeostasis in mammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers (inulin or pectin) could modulate the adverse metabolic effects of PFOS by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers: a) inulin (soluble), b) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control, insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 lg=g per day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group. Soluble fiber intake ameliorated the effects of PFOS on host hepatic metabolism gene expression and cecal content microbiome structure. DISCUSSIONS: Results from metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic studies suggest that inulin-and pectin-fed mice were less susceptible to PFOS-induced liver metabolic disturbance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and transcriptional changes compared with control diet-fed mice. Our study advances the understanding of interaction between microbes and host under the influences of environmental pollutants and nutrients. The results provide new insights into the microbe-liver metabolic network and the protection against environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases by high-fiber diets. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11360. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Elucidation of the role of environmental factors in metabolic and immune dysfunction leading to autoimmune disease is not yet well characterized. Objectives: Here we investigated the impact of exposure to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the metabolome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an experimental model of T1D. The mixture contained organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Methods: Analysis of molecular lipids (lipidomics) and bile acids in serum samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-Q-TOF/MS. Results: Experimental exposure to the POP mixture in these mice led to several metabolic changes, which were similar to those previously reported as associated with PFAS exposure, as well as risk of T1D in human studies. This included an increase in the levels of sugar derivatives, triacylglycerols and lithocholic acid, and a decrease in long chain fatty acids and several lipid classes, including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins.

The study of fetal signals poses specific challenges. Metabolomic analysis of maternal blood, the cord artery (CA), and cord vein (CV), allows simultaneous interrogation of multiple metabolic pathways associated with different modes of labour onset and birth. Methods: Global mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis was performed on serial samples collected from participants during pregnancy, in latent phase of labour, and following birth (CA, CV, and intervillous (IV) blood), from those who spontaneously laboured and birthed vaginally (SL group), had IOL and birthed vaginally (IOL group), or birthed via elective caesarean section (no labour; ECS group). Results: There were clear differences in fetal and maternal steroid, arachidonate and sphingosine pathways between the SL and IOL groups, despite similar uterine contractions and vaginal birth. The CA/CV ratio for key steroids of the IOL group were more alike the ECS group than the SL group, including progesterone (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=3.5; IOL group=0.5; and ECS group=0.5), and oestriol (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=4.3; IOL group=0.4; and for ECS group=0.2). There were no such changes in the maternal samples. Discussion: These findings indicate that IOL does not reproduce the pathways activated in spontaneous labour. The decreased placental progesterone production observed with spontaneous labour may represent a local intrauterine progesterone withdrawal, which, together with other signals, would activate parturition pathways involving arachidonate and sphingosine metabolism. © 2022 The Authors","17alpha hydroxypregnanolone glucuronide; 5alpha androstan 3alpha,17alpha diol disulfate; 5alpha androstan 3alpha,17beta diol disulfate; androstanediol; androstenediol; anesthetic agent; arachidonic acid; carnitine; corticosterone; cortisone; cytidine; estriol; estriol 3 glucuronide; estrone sulfate; fatty acid; fibrinogen; glucuronide; glycochenodeoxycholate glucuronide; hydrocortisone; hydroxyprogesterone; linoleic acid; linolenic acid; n 4 acetylcytidine; octadecanedioylcarnitine; octadecenedioylcarnitine; oestriol 16 glucuronide; oxytocin; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; prasterone; progesterone; prostaglandin E2; ranitidine; ranitidine n oxide; sphinganine; sphingosine; sphingosine 1 phosphate; steroid; tauroursodeoxycholic acid sulfate; testosterone; testosterone sulfate; unclassified drug; progesterone; sphingosine; adult; Apgar score; arachidonic acid metabolism; Article; birth; blood sampling; cesarean section; comparative study; controlled study; elective surgery; fatty acid metabolism; female; fetoplacental unit; fetus; fetus circulation; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; high risk pregnancy; human; human tissue; intervillous space; labor induction; labor onset; male; mass spectrometry; maternal blood; maternal plasma; metabolome; metabolomics; pregnancy; steroid metabolism; third trimester pregnancy; umbilical cord blood; uterus contraction; vaginal delivery; labor; labor induction; metabolome; newborn; placenta; prematurity; procedures; Cesarean Section; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Labor, Induced; Labor, Obstetric; Metabolome; Placenta; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Progesterone; Sphingosine"

Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from date of inception to June 2022. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Simultaneously, a retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent neurosurgical evaluation of suspected PEPA at our institution. Results: Of the 321 articles in the original literature search, 62 were selected. A total of 143 patients (93 men, 27 women; mean age, 70.7 years) diagnosed with PEPA were included. Mean time from carotid endarterectomy to PA diagnosis was 41.8 months. Primary repair data were available for 135 patients, including 19 with primary closures, 112 with patch or graft repairs, and 4 with eversion procedures. Fifty-five patients with PA (39%) presented with infection. Staphylococcal species were the most common causative organism. Of infected PAs, 89.1% were treated with open procedures. Overall complication rates of PAs treated via open, endovascular, and hybrid methods were 31%, 15.4%, and 0%, respectively. Open ligation (42.9%) and aneurysmectomy with grafting (36.4%) resulted in the highest rates of complications. Conclusions: Despite higher complication rates after open repair strategies, use of these techniques remains a viable option in situations requiring removal of infected patches or evacuation of large extravascular collections. Endovascular treatment options are associated with low numbers of complications and can be considered for primary PEPA treatment when infection is not present. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","acetylsalicylic acid; clopidogrel; heparin; polyvinyl alcohol sponge; rivaroxaban; thrombin; warfarin; adult; aged; aneurysm rupture; aneurysm surgery; artery graft; carotid endarterectomy; case report; clinical article; clinical outcome; diagnosis time; digital subtraction angiography; endovascular surgery; false aneurysm; female; femoral artery; heart infarction; hospital discharge; human; infected aneurysm; ligation; male; medical decision making; Medline; middle aged; neurosurgery; open surgery; postoperative complication; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; restenosis; Review; right common carotid artery; Scopus; Staphylococcus; systematic review; transient ischemic attack; very elderly; Web of Science"

However, undesired side effects, unsatisfactory response rates, tumor metastasis, and drug resistance still hinder the further application of ICB therapy against CRC. Advancing ICB with nanotechnology can be game-changing. With the development of immuno-oncology and nanomaterials, various nanoplatforms have been fabricated to enhance the efficacy of ICB in CRC treatment. Herein, this review systematically summarizes these recent nano-strategies according to their mechanisms. Despite their diverse and complex designs, these nanoplatforms have four main mechanisms in enhancing ICB: 1) targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to tumor foci, 2) increasing tumor immunogenicity, 3) remodeling tumor microenvironment, and 4) pre-sensitizing immune systems. Importantly, advantages of nanotechnology in CRC, such as innovating the mode-of-actions of ICB, modulating intestinal microbiome, and integrating the whole process of antigen presentation, are highlighted in this review. In general, this review describes the latest applications of nanotechnology for CRC immunotherapy, and may shed light on the future design of ICB platforms.

Sertoli and Leydig cells were perturbed, resulting in a decrease in testosterone levels and sperm counts. However, the effects of PFOS on male fecundity are not limited to the testes. In this study, we demonstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 μg/g BW and 5 μg/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular transcriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Altogether, the activation of brain nuclei, shift of hypothalamic metabolome, and reduction of LH/LHr circuit resulted from PFOS exposure suggested the toxicant's systematic effects on male reproduction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biochemistry; Brain; Cell proliferation; Mammals; Blood-testis barrier; Hormone receptors; Hypothalamus; Locus coeruleus; Luteinizing hormones; Metabolomes; Perfluorooctanesulphonic acid; Sertoli cells; Sperm motility; Transcriptomes; Chemical activation; luteinizing hormone; luteinizing hormone receptor; neurotransmitter receptor; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; protein c fos; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; testosterone; brain; fecundity; gene expression; male; metabolism; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; sperm; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety; Article; brain nucleus; controlled study; environmental exposure; epididymis; gene expression; hypothalamus disease; immunohistochemistry; lateral septal nucleus; locus ceruleus; male; male infertility; metabolic pathway analysis; mouse; nonhuman; paraventricular thalamic nucleus; protein processing; protein synthesis; reproductive toxicity; spermatozoon motility; steroidogenesis; testis; transcriptomics; animal; fertility; hypothalamus; metabolism; sperm; spermatozoon motility; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Fertility; Fluorocarbons; Hypothalamus; Male; Mice; Semen; Sperm Motility; Testis; Testosterone"

Recently, adsorption has been proved as an efficient strategy, and emerging adsorbents have shown promising removal performance. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in adsorbents for the eradication of MPs/NPs from water.

Few studies have examined exposure at reproductive organs. Our aim was to perform a preliminary untargeted metabolomic characterization of menstrual blood, a novel biofluid, to identify environmental toxins present in the endometrium and evaluate the suitability of this sample type for exposome research. Methods: Whole blood menstrual samples were collected from four women using a menstrual cup. Samples were analyzed for small molecules that include both environmental chemicals and endogenous metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA was used to identify differences within and between individuals' menstrual blood metabolomic profiles, and the influence of the sample processing method. To assess the presence of environmental exposures, LC-HRMS chemical profiles were matched to the ToxCast chemical database, which includes 4557 commonly used commercial chemicals. Select compounds were confirmed by comparison to reference standards. Results: PCA of metabolome profiles showed analysis of menstrual blood samples were highly reproducible, with high variability in detected metabolites between participants and low variability between analytical replicates of an individual's sample. Endogenous metabolites detected in menstrual blood samples achieved good coverage of the human blood metabolome. We found 1748 annotations for environmental chemicals, including suspected reproductive toxicants such as phenols, parabens, phthalates, and organochlorines. Storage temperature for the first 24 h did not significantly influence global metabolomic profiles. Conclusion: Our results show chemical exposures linked to reproductive toxicity and endocrine disruption are present in menstrual blood, a sampling medium for the endometrium. © 2022","Biomolecules; Blood; Endocrine disrupters; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Principal component analysis; Blood samples; Endogenous metabolites; Environmental chemicals; Exposome; High resolution mass spectrometry; Menstrual blood; Menstruation; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Principal-component analysis; Liquid chromatography; alkyl group; endocrine disruptor; organochlorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; phenol; phthalic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; biomarker; blood; endocrine disruptor; metabolite; reproductive health; toxicity; adult; analytic method; Article; blood analysis; blood sampling; comparative study; concentration (parameter); endometrium; environmental exposure; female; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; menstruation; metabolomics; principal component analysis; reproducibility; reproductive health; reproductive toxicity; storage temperature; dangerous goods; endometrium; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolome; procedures; Chromatography, Liquid; Endometrium; Female; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolome; Metabolomics"

In this study, we investigated the potential health effects of organohalogen compounds (OHCs) on thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis and metabolomics in Japanese pet cats. There was a significant negative correlation between concentrations of several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and THs in cat serum samples. These results suggested that exposure to OHCs causes a decrease in serum TH levels in pet cats. In this metabolomics study, each exposure level of parent compounds (PCBs and PBDEs) and their hydroxylated compounds (OH-PCBs and OH-PBDEs) were associated with their own unique primary metabolic pathways, suggesting that parent and phenolic compounds exhibit different mechanisms of action and biological effects. PCBs were associated with many metabolic pathways, including glutathione and purine metabolism, and the effects were replicated in in-vivo cat PCB administration studies. These results demonstrated that OHC exposure causes chronic oxidative stress in pet cats. PBDEs were positively associated with alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.

The manufacturing and disposal of PFAS-containing products has resulted in PFAS contamination of groundwater and drinking water supplies. Substantial interest and efforts in developing PFAS treatment technologies has been triggered since PFAS are associated with numerous adverse health effects. Physical separation using activated carbon and ion exchange is the most widely adopted technique for PFAS removal from contaminated water. However, both adsorbents generally exhibit low PFAS adsorption capacities and/or slow adsorption kinetics. The development of efficient adsorbents is of urgent need.

In this review, recent advances in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo-reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS by photo-oxidation involving the holes (hvb+) and oxidative radicals and photo-reduction using the electrons (ecb-) and hydrated electrons (eaq-) are integrated.

However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992–27,061 µg/L (influent wastewater) and 1208–7943 µg/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4–89%, 8–100%, 16–100%, and 17–98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81–95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94–98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs.

The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs’ removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL’s size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces. © 2022 by the authors.","hydraulic conductivity; literature review; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant removal; redevelopment; runoff; stormwater; urban development"

Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; &gt;55 μg/L) were associated with 4.5-fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), α-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain α-keto acid), and 7α-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most common forms of liver cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues for helping to prevent this disease. © 2022 The Author(s)","2 oxoisovaleric acid; 7alpha hydroxy 3 oxo 4 cholestenoate; amino acid; bile acid; butyric acid; glucose; glycan; perfluoroalkanoic acid; unclassified drug; aged; amino acid synthesis; Article; blood sampling; cancer risk; carbohydrate metabolism; case control study; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; environmental exposure; ethnicity; female; genome-wide association study; groups by age; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; male; metabolome; metabolomics; pathway enrichment analysis; population structure; prospective study; race; sex ratio"

In this critical situation and rising water demand, biological techniques are the need of the hour for wastewater treatment and reuse, thereby protecting the environment. This paper highlights the most used bioreactors like Biofilter, Vermifiltration, MFC, MBBR, UASB, and MBR and their unique features. Additionally, details like intermediates, microbiology, operational conditions, mechanisms, implications, advantages, recent advancements, shortcomings, and removal efficiency of target pollutants (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous- CNP; emerging contaminants- pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptive compounds) were discussed. The traditional and advanced versions of those bioreactors were also emphasized. Moreover, the review highlights different case studies related to the reuse scope of treated water that must be addressed for upcoming expansions and large-scale application of biological techniques in water reuse and the further development of hybrid systems. MFC is a well-known treatment technology for removing pollutants from wastewater when undertaken on a small scale; however, attempts should be made to make it successful on a larger scale.

Well known, in terms of carbon-atom hybridization, well-established forms of carbon are diamond with the three-dimensional sp3-hybridized carbon atoms and graphite with the two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon atoms which have been known and utilized for millennia. Additionally, more carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene composed of sp2-hybridized carbon, and Lonsdaleite and C8 composed of sp3-hybridized carbon each show unique properties, usually different from those of either diamond or graphite, offering technological breakthroughs. Sequentially, there is the third carbon, i.e., carbyne with the one-dimensional sp-hybridization, which would result in an allotrope of carbon, whereas diamond and graphite feature three- and two-dimensional ones, respectively. Recently, carbyne nanocrystals (CNCs), the condensed phase of carbyne with the finite chain length and the one-dimensional sp-hybridized carbon atoms with the alternating carbon–carbon single and triple bonds, the dubbed the third carbon, have been synthesized in the laboratory (Science Advances 2015; 1 (9): e1500857), and these CNCs are white powders, so they are called white carbon. Interestingly, there have been many works showing that CNCs possess potential applications in luminescence, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic sensing and biomedicine probes. Therefore, these findings above imply that we have being on the threshold of a new era of carbyne science and technology. This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and accessible review of general interest to the material community. Therefore, the review will survey the latest progresses of CNCs, provide a comprehensive understanding of synthesis, structure, property, and applications of CNCs, and put forward the perspective for the further development of CNCs. Firstly, we will present the basic understanding of classification and definition of carbyne. The history of carbyne research will be introduced and different definitions of carbyne in different periods are summarized. Next, a reasonable classification of carbyne research is proposed. Secondly, we will briefly introduce various approaches for the synthesis of carbyne and focus on describing LAL technique which is more suitable to produce CNCs compared with other methods. Thirdly, we will summarize structure, properties, and related applications of CNCs, including electronics, optics and magnetism, and optoelectronic and biomedical applications.

Pleurotus ostreatus is a widely cultivated edible fungus that is prone to attack from fungivorous insects and mites. Yet P. ostreatus has evolved an elegant defense system against fungivore attacks. In this study, we investigated how the oyster mushroom responds to the fungivory and mechanical wounding by conducting transcriptome, proteome, and secondary metabolic analyses. The profiling analysis revealed a total of 11,495 transcripts and 866 proteins, 4416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 62 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in response to the mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae feeding and mechanical wounding. In comparing the responses induced by mechanical wounding, some genes, proteins, and metabolites were uniquely induced or repressed by the mite. At the transcript level, nine pathways were activated by the mite feeding, including those of “MAPK signaling pathway–yeast”, “Phenylalanine metabolism”, and “Biotin metabolism”, among others, while both enrichment of “Ribosome”, “Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes”, and “Regulation of Mitophagy in Yeast” demonstrated the common effects upon fungal secretory protein synthesis and processing induced by fungivory and mechanical wounding. Fungivory also stimulated the synthesis of C8-aryl compounds and sesquiterpenes (especially1-octen-3-ol and α-/β-bisabolene), and these compounds repellent to T. putrescentiae. Both jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) were specifically regulated by mite feeding and mechanical wounding. The terpene synthase gene transcription was significantly increased induced by the exogenous addition of MeJA, resulting in defensive sesquiterpene production against the mite. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/MAPK signaling pathway, JA regulation, specific gene expression, and protein synthesis, and anti-mite substance metabolism are all involved in coordinated inducible chemical-based defense responses in P. ostreatus, which could be especially effective the mite T. putrescentiae. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Amino acids; Biosynthesis; Cell signaling; Coordination reactions; Feeding; Mechanisms; Metabolites; Network security; Proteins; Transcription; Yeast; Bisabolene; Chemical defense; Edible fungus; Fungal chemical defense; Fungivore; Jasmonic acids; Mechanical wounding; Mushroom; Pleurotus; Sesquiterpenes; Metabolism; fungal protein; Acaridae; animal; defense mechanism; genetics; mycelium; Pleurotus; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Acaridae; Animals; Defense Mechanisms; Fungal Proteins; Mycelium; Pleurotus; Saccharomyces cerevisiae"

A comprehensive review about ECs including the occurrence and ecotoxicity, as well as the controlling strategies was made. Firstly, the idea of ECs ""block""was introduced to connect different ECs during the supply of feed and food chain. The existence of ECs in different contaminant blocks would eventually affect human health. Secondly, the conventional strategies including physical, chemical, and biological methods against ECs were presented such as the removal of PPCPs and PAHs. Notably, conventional strategies like filtration, adsorption, and sedimentation could hardly eliminate the parent compound of ECs. Last but not least, the biological strategies employed by the oxidoreductases (ORs) group like lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, laccase, and horseradish peroxidase were also evaluated for ECs elimination. Although the elimination of pharmaceuticals by the lignin peroxidase and laccase in lab-scale are gratifying, the removal of other ECs like PAHs, and PFCs are still insufficient by the ORs family. All in all, a combination of conventional strategies with enzymatic-based catalysis would greatly integrate the advantages and allow a promising, efficient, and eco-friendly controllable solution to ECs decontamination. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.","Contamination; Decontamination; Enzymes; Health risks; Lignin; Combination; Emerging contaminant; Human health; Insufficient; Oxido-reductases; Perfluorinated compounds; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Promising; Strategy; Treatment; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Chains; Health; Impurities; Laccase; Lignins; Peroxidase; Removal; Supply"

Several technologies have been proposed for water reclamation, but only some of them have been successfully implemented at real scale. Against this backdrop, the present review aims to compare the performance of the main technologies that have been implemented at pilot and industrial scale for sewage reuse. In order to do so, we conducted a search for scientific articles in Web of Science, using different search strings and focusing exclusively in studies at pilot and industrial scale. A bibliometric analysis of the retrieved works was performed, followed by a critical review of their main findings regarding the removal efficiency of regulated and emerging pollutants, and their compliance with international reuse guidelines. The bibliometric analysis suggests that public policies promoting wastewater reuse is a relevant driver behind the research and development of water reclamation technologies, and shows that most of the published research has been oriented towards technical assessments, with less reports dealing with social issues. Many of the identified processes show significant removals of conventionally regulated pollutants, and allow to meet the quality standards of international guidelines. Among those, membrane technologies present significant and consistent removal of several contaminants. However, the removal of organic micropollutants remains an important challenge for reuse technologies, and the importance of identifying and optimizing the operational conditions necessary to provide an efficient, safe, and consistent removal, both in terms of the presence of the aforementioned contaminants and challenges such as antibiotic resistant microorganisms, is emphasized. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.","Efficiency; Industrial water treatment; Membrane technology; Pollution; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Bibliometrics analysis; Critical analysis; Industrial scale; Performance; Pilot scale; Regulated pollutants; Reuse; Treatment efficiency; Treatment technologies; Wastewater reuse; Wastewater reclamation"

These pollutants are known for the potential risk that they pose in the environment, and have been consistently found in surface, waste, and potable waters. Moreover, some of them are persistent to conventional treatments and in the environment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely used technology for the removal of EPs The use of peracetic acid (PAA) as an oxidant AOP for the treatment of EPs has attracted increasing interest, owing to its ease of activation, and to the selectivity of the organic radicals that are generated in these processes towards electron rich sites, which makes them more robust against the effect of scavenging agents in real matrices. This work presents a critical analysis of the advantages, disadvantages, and opportunities of PAA-based processes. Several strategies for PAA activation were analyzed, including UV and transition metal activation, heterogeneous catalysis, thermal and microwave activation, and phosphate induced activation. It was found that PAA-based AOPs seem to have several advantages over other widely studied processes. Some key perspectives for research include testing of these processes with a variety of EPs, analysis of transformation products and their toxicity in the treated effluents, multivariate optimization of the process, direct comparison with widely studied oxidants, and experimentation for escalation and implementation. Nevertheless, PAA-based AOPs seem to be a promising alternative to conventional AOPs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is ~15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a “background” concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater pollution; Risk assessment; Soil pollution; Soils; Surface waters; Concentration ranges; Data set; Datapoints; Global distribution; Meta-analysis; Perfluorooctanesulphonic acid; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Source types; Times series; Groundwater; ground water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sea water; surface water; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); geographical distribution; groundwater pollution; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant source; soil pollution; Article; risk assessment; soil analysis; soil pollution; time series analysis; waste component removal; water analysis; water availability; water pollution; water quality; water supply; ecosystem; human; meta analysis; soil; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Therefore, we focus on the interaction of MPs and PFASs and related combined toxicity in aquatic environments in this work. The adsorption of PFASs on MPs is critically reviewed, and new mechanisms such as halogen bonding, π-π interaction, cation-π interactions, and micelle formation are proposed. Moreover, the effect of MPs on the transport and transformation of PFASs in aquatic environments is discussed. Based on four typical aquatic organisms (shellfish, Daphnia, algae, and fish), the toxicity of MPs and/or PFASs at the organismal or molecular levels is also evaluated and summarized. Finally, challenges and research perspectives are proposed, and the roles of the shapes and aging process of MPs on PFAS biogeochemical processes and toxicity, especially on PFAS substitutes, are recommended for further investigation.

Short chain alkanes (C2-C8) have been well-known as inhibitors for nitrification through interaction with the ammonia monooxygenase, while whether these alkanes affect anammox is an open question. Here, this work demonstrated significant inhibition of ethane on anammox and revealed the inhibitory mechanism. The acute inhibition of ethane on anammox was concentration-dependent and reversible; 0.86 mM dissolved ethane caused 50% inhibition (IC50), and 1.72 mM ethane almost completely inhibited anammox. After long-term exposure to 0.09 mM ethane for 30 days, the ammonium (nitrite) removal rate dropped from 202 (267) mg N L-1 d-1 to 1 (1) mg N L-1 d-1, and the abundance of anammox bacteria decreased from 61.9% to 9.5%. The intercellular ammonium concentration of anammox bacteria decreased after ethane exposure, while metatranscriptome analysis showed significant upregulation of genes for ammonium transport of anammox bacteria. Thus, ethane could suppress ammonium uptake resulting in the inhibition of anammox activities. As ethane is the second most prevalent alkane after methane in various anoxic environments, ethane may have an important effect on the nitrogen cycle driven by anammox that should be investigated in future research. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","Ammonia; Ethane; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Oxidation; Paraffins; Wastewater treatment; Acute inhibition; Ammonia monooxygenase; Ammonium oxidation; Ammonium transport; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Chronic inhibition; Ethane exposure; Nitrogen cycles; Oxidation pathway; Shorter chains; Bacteria; ammonia; ethane; ammonium derivative; ethane; methane; nitrite; nitrogen; ammonium compound; bacterium; inhibition; microbial activity; oxidation; ammonium uptake; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anammox bacterium; Article; biomass; controlled study; long term exposure; microbial community; nonhuman; sequence analysis; anaerobic growth; bacterium; bioreactor; denitrification; metabolism; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; Ammonium Compounds; Anaerobiosis; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Ethane; Methane; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction"

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The soil and subsurface environments are the geological media commonly affected by PFAS. We conducted a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 through 2022 concerning the fate and transport of PFAS in subsurface environments. This review is organized into different subsections, covering the basics of PFAS properties and how they affect the occurrence, fate, and transport of PFAS, the fundamental processes affecting subsurface transport and fate of PFAS, and mathematical models for describing and predicting PFAS transport behaviors. Mechanisms governing PFAS transport in the subsurface environment, including the sorption of PFAS at the air-water interface, solid-water interface, and nonaqueous phase liquids-water interface, were explored in detail.

Regulation of PFASs remains a big concern for society. Based on the knowledge that C-F is the strongest single bond in organic chemistry, PFASs are considered as high persistent substances by some scientists. Therefore, it is recommended that PFASs be managed as a highly persistent category and that all ‘nonessential’ uses of these chemicals should be phased out. In view of their wide application in various fields, involving huge socioeconomic impacts, accelerating the phase-out of PFASs is bound to have a huge impact on society and economy. It is therefore a long way to go in reaching consensus on PFASs management. As a result, phasing out PFASs requires a lengthy transition period. Currently, meaningful actions are needed to minimize the potential exposure risk of PFASs while meeting their social needs. In fact, there are approximately 5000 PFASs available on the global market. Studies indicate that the transformation behaviors of PFASs happen under different conditions, which result in various kinds of new emerging PFASs in natural environment and biota. There are limited data on the PBT properties of these new PFASs. Actually, some new PFASs are environmentally friendly themselves, but they can degrade to highly toxic and persistent PFASs such as PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS. These transformation products thereby become indirect sources of traditional PFASs in the environment, which would eventually lead to constant human exposure to these chemicals. Thus, it is very important to study the transformation of PFASs. Transformational studies can help identify transformational products with lower persistence and toxicity, which will provide valuable insights into the design of safer fluorinated alternatives. Here, for the first time, we propose that strengthening the study on the transformation of PFASs is an important strategy for classifying and managing fluorinated alternatives, and this will provide technical framework and support for the regulation of fluorinated alternatives. Furthermore, we make these proposals on the way forward for investigating transformational process of PFASs. Firstly, nontargeted and high-resolution mass spectrometry technologies must be continually developed, as these investigation methods are able to implement high throughput analysis of transformation products by assembling formulas and possible structures from molecular precursor and fragment data of existing PFASs. Secondly, the transmission, accumulation, metabolism, and elimination behaviors of PFASs in different matrices should be of high concern. In this regard, a combination of multi-omics, high-throughput toxicity testing, theory calculation, and machine learning is recommended to explor the potential mechanisms, and the essential factors affecting the process. Through this, the transformation products with PBT properties can be ascertained, prioritized, and managed. Lastly, biological networks elaborating the relationship between PFASs transformation products and adverse health effects should be established. The transformation products of PFASs may eventually pose adverse public health risks, which suggests that mapping a systematic transformation network would be beneficial to the classified management of fluorinated alternatives. This is challenging because of their diverse structures and huge numbers, however, the accomplishment of the first two proposals above will facilitate this process. © 2022 Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice. © 2022 Hahn et al.

Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086–1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects. © 2022 by the authors.","perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; hepatitis; literature review; meta-analysis; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; alanine aminotransferase blood level; data extraction; disease association; exposure; human; liver; liver disease; meta analysis (topic); publication bias; Review; systematic review; meta analysis; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Liver Diseases; Water"

These exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors, challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant. Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites. Objectives: The aim of this study is to review the application of metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to occupational diseases. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to 2021. Results: Most of reviewed studies included worker populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride. Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes. The reviewed studies demonstrate that metabolomics provides a powerful ability to identify metabolic phenotypes and bioeffect of occupational exposures. Conclusion: Continued application to worker populations has the potential to enable characterization of thousands of chemical signals in biological samples, which could lead to discovery of new biomarkers of exposure for chemicals, identify possible toxicological mechanisms, and improved understanding of biological effects increasing disease risk associated with occupational exposure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; acrylamide; biological marker; dioxin; heavy metal; polyvinylchloride; trichloroethylene; volatile organic compound; biological monitoring; exposome; hyperbaric pressure; metabolite; metabolomics; nonhuman; occupational disease; occupational health; pollutant; quality control; Review; systematic review; threshold limit value; toxicity; adverse event; analysis; human; metabolomics; occupational disease; occupational exposure; toxicity; Biomarkers; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Metabolomics; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure"

The scientific literature on PFAS has increased dramatically in the last decade. Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS. Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d). PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org. Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or more PFAS of interest. There were 505 human, 385 animal, and 220 in vitro studies. Summary tables of the extracted data and overall observations are included in this report. Conclusions: The PFAS-Tox Database is a useful tool for searching, filtering, and identifying peer reviewed research on the health and toxicological effects of the included PFAS. In this summary of the evidence map we provide examples of data gaps and clusters revealed by the database, with the goal of helping direct future research efforts, facilitate systematic reviews (e.g. on immune effects, mixtures of PFAS, or effects of short chain PFAS), inform regulatory risk assessments, and improve opportunities for cross-disciplinary coordination. We also discuss how this tool supports scientists, regulatory agencies, and other individuals by increasing awareness and access to current evidence regarding the health effects associated with PFAS exposure. © 2022","Consumer products; Data mining; Database systems; Health; Industrial chemicals; Risk assessment; Health effects; Health-study; In-vitro; Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Synthetic chemicals; Systematic evidence map; Toxicological effects; Toxicology; Vitro studies; Animals; adult; animal experiment; article; awareness; female; filtration; human; in vitro study; male; Medline; metadata; nonhuman; population exposure; risk assessment; toxicology; animal; chemistry; factual database; fluorocarbon; Animals; Databases, Factual; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment"

Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of two large studies of PFOA and renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer); one from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (324 cases and controls), and a second from the C8 Science Panel (103 cases and 511 controls). Serum PFOA levels were estimated a median of 8 years before diagnosis. Analyses were conducted via conditional logistic regression. Lifetime risk of kidney cancer per unit serum PFOA concentration and per unit dose were calculated. Results: The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of serum PFOA levels were 4.8, 7.3, and 23.9 ng/ml for the pooled analysis. The preferred model for the pooled data was a two-piece linear spline model (knot at 12.5 ng/ml serum PFOA); the log odds of RCC increased 0.1349 per 1 ng/ml increase in serum PFOA up to the knot (eg, an OR of 2.02 (1.45–2.80) from the median to the knot), and was flat thereafter. The estimated lifetime excess risk (cancer slope factor) with an exposure of 1 ng/ml was 0.0018, similar to the excess risk of 0.0026 recently reported by CalEPA based on different methods. Assuming a serum half-life of 2.3 years and a distribution volume of 170 ml/kg for PFOA, our results are equivalent to 0.0128 per ng/kg/d of PFOA intake. To limit excess lifetime kidney cancer risk to 1/1,000,000, our data suggest a limit of 0.0015 ng/L (0.0015 ppt) for PFOA in drinking water, similar to CalEPA's proposed Public Health Goal and the new US EPA Drinking Water Health Advisory. Conclusions: Our results correspond reasonably well with cancer slope factors developed by other investigators using published summary data, and suggest drinking water limits similar to new recommendations by the US EPA. © 2022 The Author(s)","Diseases; Potable water; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Conditional logistic regressions; Human study; Kidney cancer; National Cancer Institute; Per unit; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Pooled analyse; Renal cell carcinoma; Risks assessments; Slope factors; Risk assessment; drinking water; perfluorooctanoic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; cancer; drinking water; health risk; risk assessment; serum; adult; aged; Article; blood level; body mass; cancer risk; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; human; hypertension; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; plasma half life; renal cell carcinoma; risk assessment; statistical model; two piece linear spline model; volume of distribution; adverse event; environmental exposure; kidney tumor; meta analysis; risk assessment; water pollutant; Caprylates; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review.

The electro-generated hydrogen peroxide leads to the improvement in ozone transformation to hydroxyl radical; hence, the electro-peroxone can considerably improve the treatment performance, total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization, and reduction of ozone-resistant emerging pollutants compared with the traditional ozonation process. Moreover, the main disadvantage of the traditional ozonation process for water treatment is bromate generation during the treatment of bromide-containing water sources, which can be remarkably decreased by the application of this technology. Additionally, because of its enhanced kinetics of contaminant degradation, electro-peroxone offers a more secure, time-efficient, energy-saving, and effective alternative for the reduction of emerging pollutants, compared with different ozone-dependent AOPs including traditional UV/O3 and peroxone (O3/H2O2) methods. Hence, it can offer a suitable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to markedly enhance the efficiency of the current ozonation process. This paper reviews the principles of the electro-peroxone process and compares its efficiency with other methods. The essential reaction mechanisms and experimental parameters that are crucial to the operation, realization, and design of the electro-peroxone, including ozone dosage, applied current, injected ozone flowrate, electrolyte type, electrode setup, solution pH, and type of cathode and anode on electro-peroxone efficiency, are investigated. Moreover, the application of electro-peroxone for water and wastewater treatment is explored. Finally, the challenges in wide-ranging application of electro-peroxone, the future research direction, and its incorporation in wastewater and water treatment systems for viable application are discussed. © 2022, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.",

Immunomodulation and epigenetic regulation have been hypothesized as mediators of this relationship, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are not well-characterized. This review examines the evidence for epigenetic modification at the intersection of COVID-19 and environmental chemical exposures. Recent Findings: Numerous environmental contaminants including air pollutants, toxic metal(loid)s, per- and polyfluorinated substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk of severe COVID-19, but few studies currently exist. Drawing on evidence that many environmental chemicals alter the epigenetic regulation of key immunity genes and pathways, we discuss how exposures likely perturb host antiviral responses. Specific mechanisms vary by contaminant but include general immunomodulation as well as regulation of viral entry and recognition, inflammation, and immunologic memory pathways, among others. Summary: Associations between environmental contaminants and COVID-19 are likely mediated, in part, by epigenetic regulation of key immune pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV-2. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","endocrine disruptor; adverse event; environmental exposure; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; COVID-19; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; SARS-CoV-2"

HFPO-TA is reported to have high capability of bioaccumulation, widespread environmental distribution, and multiple toxicities. However, its potential toxicity on the intestines and gut microbiota remains unknown. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA for 6 weeks, and after total genomic DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing was performed. Our results demonstrated that HFPO-TA exposure resulted in the imbalance of cecal microbiota and alterations of cecal microbiota diversity. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Tenericutes increased in mice after exposure to HFPO-TA, while the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and TM7 decreased. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ver Akkermansia, Pre Prevotella, Lac Coprococcus, Por_Parabacteroides, and Lac Dorea decreased in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Meanwhile, the increased relative abundances of Def_Mucispirillum, Des_Desulfovibrio and Odo Odoribacter were observed in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Additionally, KEGG metabolic pathway analysis revealed that HFPO-TA exposure changed the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism pathway and other metabolic pathways. Collectively, all these findings indicate the potential gut toxicity of HFPO-TA and is perceived as a risk of health on gut microbiota.

With over 9000 compounds belonging to this chemical class, there is increasing concern regarding human exposure to these compounds due to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic nature. Human exposure to PFAS may occur from a variety of exposure sources, including, air, food, indoor dust, soil, water, from the transfer of PFAS from non-stick wrappers to food, use of cosmetics, and other personal care products. This critical review presents recent research on the health-related impacts of PFAS exposure, highlighting compounds other than Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) that cause adverse health effects, updates the current state of knowledge on PFAS toxicity, and, where possible, elucidates cause-and-effect relationships. Recent reviews identified that exposure to PFAS was associated with adverse health impacts on female and male fertility, metabolism in pregnancy, endocrine function including pancreatic dysfunction and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, lipid metabolism and risk of childhood adiposity, hepatic and renal function, immune function, cardiovascular health (atherosclerosis), bone health including risk for dental cavities, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency, neurological function, and risk of developing breast cancer. However, while cause-and-effect relationships for many of these outcomes were not able to be clearly elucidated, it was identified that 1) the evidence derived from both animal models and humans suggested that PFAS may exert harmful impacts on both animals and humans, however extrapolating data from animal to human studies was complicated due to differences in exposure/elimination kinetics, 2) PFAS precursor kinetics and toxicity mechanism data are still limited despite ongoing exposures, and 3) studies in humans, which provide contrasting results require further investigation of the long-term-exposed population to better evaluate the biological toxicity of chronic exposure to PFAS. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","perfluoroctane sulfonate; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; chemical substance; comparative study; health impact; knowledge; lipid; metabolism; reaction kinetics; toxicity; acute toxicity; adverse event; bioaccumulation; bone disease; breast cancer; cardiovascular effect; carotid atherosclerosis; childhood; clinical evaluation; comparative study; cytotoxicity; disease association; endocrine function; female fertility; health status; human; immune response; immunotoxicity; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; lipid metabolism; liver dysfunction; liver function; locomotion; long term exposure; male fertility; metabolic regulation; neurologic disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; pancreas disease; population; pregnancy; reproductive toxicity; respiratory function; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; thyroid function; tooth disease; vitamin D deficiency; animal; dust; female; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dust; Female; Fluorocarbons; Male; Pregnancy"

Owing to its excellent properties such as porosity, three-dimensional structure, being amenable to chemical modifications, it is imperative to devise strategies for their improved production and use. Bioaerogels are non-toxic and most of their precursor compounds are biomass-derived. This review aims to present a comprehensive report on survey of existing literature published on the use of bioaerogels for removal of all major categories of water contaminants, namely, heavy metals, industrial dyes, oil, organic compounds and pharmaceuticals. It also gives critical analysis of the lacunae in the existing knowledge such as lack of studies on domestic sewage, emerging pollutants, toxicity of raw materials and adequate disposal of used adsorbents. Proposals of overcoming the limitations in the applicability of bioaerogels, like combining constructed wetlands with use of bioaerogels, among others have been discussed.

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aδSPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aδSPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening diseases.","autoantibody; fibrinogen receptor; albinism; autoimmune disease; bleeding disorder; Glanzmann disease; human; metabolism; ocular albinism; Albinism; Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Hemorrhagic Disorders; Hermanski-Pudlak Syndrome; Humans; Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex; Thrombasthenia"

J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. Methods: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Results: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI.

Due to the complexity of PFAS, the need for multiple environmental matrix considerations and the absence of a promulgated federal standard for environmental sampling and analysis, U.S. states have begun developing health-based regulatory and/or guidance values for a limited number of PFAS in environmental matrices. As there is a growing body of science to inform PFAS sampling guidance standard development, it is important to understand which U.S. states are implementing sampling guidelines and how they plan to handle emerging PFAS. This critical review discusses the current and impending federal and state sampling guidelines for PFAS in environmental matrices, the data gaps surrounding PFAS sampling guidance in U.S. states, and the future impacts of impending guidance documents and regulations. Ten federal guidance documents are available for PFAS sampling guidance and analysis. The maximum number of PFAS covered in these guidance documents is 25 analytes spanning across 8 unique media. While the EPA has developed several different sampling and analytical guidelines for PFAS, there is no formal regulation of PFAS or requirements of states to enforce these guidelines. As a result, only 31 states have informally adopted sampling guidelines, while the other 19 states have no guidance documentation in place for PFAS. The introduction of new PFAS sampling guidelines by the EPA, as well as updated analytical guidelines that target more PFAS or total organofluoride, is expected to continuously shift the landscape of federal and state guidance for PFAS sampling moving forward. © 2022","Environmental Protection Agency; Matrix algebra; Organic chemicals; 'current; Emerging contaminant; Environmental analysis; Environmental matrixes; Environmental sampling; Federal standards; Growing bodies; Guidance document; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Regulatory guidance; Environmental regulations; drinking water; ground water; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acid derivative; perfluoroalkylphosphinic acid derivative; perfluoroalkylphosphonic acid derivative; perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid derivative; perfluoroethercarboxylic acid derivative; perfluoroethersulfonic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; surface water; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; documentary source; environmental protection; federal system; polymer; regulatory approach; sampling; state role; ambient air; Article; effluent; environmental exposure; food; high performance liquid chromatography; human; intermethod comparison; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass spectrometry; multiple reaction monitoring; muscle; nonhuman; plasma; sampling; serum; sludge; soil; solid phase extraction; ultra performance liquid chromatography; United States; wastewater; water sampling; documentation; specimen handling; United States; Documentation; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Specimen Handling"

PFAS cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. Thus, PFAS are a likely risk for neurotoxicity. Studies that measured PFAS levels in the brains of humans, polar bears, and rats have demonstrated that some areas of the brain accumulate greater amounts of PFAS. Moreover, in humans, there is evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and an increased cause of death from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in elderly populations. Given possible links to neurological disease, critical analyses of possible mechanisms of neurotoxic action are necessary to advance the field. This paper critically reviews studies that investigated potential mechanistic causes for neurotoxicity including (1) a change in neurotransmitter levels, (2) dysfunction of synaptic calcium homeostasis, and (3) alteration of synaptic and neuronal protein expression and function. We found growing evidence that PFAS exposure causes neurotoxicity through the disruption of neurotransmission, particularly the dopamine and glutamate systems, which are implicated in age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated research has shown there are highly reproduced increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus and catecholamine levels in the hypothalamus and decreased dopamine in the whole brain after PFAS exposure. There are significant gaps in the literature relative to the assessment of the nigrostriatal system (striatum and ventral midbrain) among other regions associated with PFAS-associated neurologic dysfunction observed in humans. In conclusion, evidence suggests that PFAS may be neurotoxic and associated with chronic and age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies assess the impact of PFAS and PFAS mixtures on the mechanism of neurotransmission and the consequential functional effects. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","acetylcholine; calcium; calcium channel L type; catecholamine; dopamine; glutamate receptor; glutamic acid; monoamine; neurotransmitter; perfluoro compound; dopamine; fluorocarbon; glutamic acid derivative; Alzheimer disease; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; behavior; bioaccumulation; blood; brain; brain region; calcium cell level; calcium current; calcium homeostasis; calcium signaling; corpus striatum; degenerative disease; hippocampus; human; hypothalamus; mental disease; monoamine metabolism; nerve degeneration; neurotoxicity; neurotransmission; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; protein expression; protein function; Review; synapse; ventral mesencephalon; aged; animal; child; metabolism; pollutant; rat; synaptic transmission; toxicity; toxicity and intoxication; Aged; Animals; Child; Dopamine; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Glutamates; Humans; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Rats; Synaptic Transmission"

This class, comprising of thousands of chemicals, have been used in many different products ranging from firefighting foam to personal care products and clothes. Even at relatively low levels of exposure, PFAS have been linked to various health effects in humans such as lower birth weight, increased serum cholesterol levels, and reduced antibody response to vaccination. Human biomonitoring data demonstrates ubiquitous exposure to PFAS across all age groups. This has been attributed to PFAS-contaminated water and dietary intake, as well as inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust for adults and toddlers. In utero exposure and breast milk have been indicated as important exposure pathways for foetuses and nursing infants. More recently, PFAS have been identified in a wide range of products, many of which come in contact with skin (e.g., cosmetics and fabrics). Despite this, few studies have evaluated dermal uptake as a possible route for human exposure and little is known about the dermal absorption potential of different PFAS. This article critically investigates the current state-of-knowledge on human exposure to PFAS, highlighting the lack of dermal exposure data. Additionally, the different approaches for dermal uptake assessment studies are discussed and the available literature on human dermal absorption of PFAS is critically reviewed and compared to other halogenated contaminants, e.g., brominated flame retardants and its implications for dermal exposure to PFAS.

The results showed that nanoplastics enhanced the accumulation of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and the activities of catalase and peroxidase. The concentrations of iron, sulfur, and zinc were reduced after nanoplastic exposure. PSNP treatment had an important effect on a series of chemical and genetic indicators of T. grandis, includingantioxidants, small RNA, gene transcription, protein expressions, and metabolite accumulation. Multi-omic analysis revealed that PSNPs modulate terpenoid- and flavonoid-biosynthesis pathways by regulating small RNA transcription and protein expression. Our study provided novelty insights into the responses of forest plants to nanoplastic treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic organisms; Forestry; Lipids; Metabolites; Physiological models; Pollution; Proteins; RNA; Transcription; 'omics'; Emerging pollutants; Flavonoid; Molecular response; Multi-omic; Nanoplastics; Protein expressions; Small RNA; Terpenoids; Torreya grandis; Biochemistry; catalase; flavonoid; iron; nanoplastic; peroxidase; polystyrene; sulfur; terpenoid; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; zinc; antioxidant; polystyrene derivative; RNA; molecular analysis; plastic; secondary metabolite; shoot; Article; biochemical analysis; biosynthesis; China; enzyme activity; genetic transcription; metabolite; microplastic pollution; multiomics; nonhuman; physiological process; pollutant; protein expression; RNA gene; seedling; shoot; Taxaceae; Torreya grandis; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; toxicity; China; Antioxidants; Environmental Pollutants; Microplastics; Polystyrenes; RNA; Taxaceae"

PFAS are stable and extremely resistant to degradation, resulting in high persistence throughout the environment as well as in human blood. PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

As a transformation pathway, the catalytic pyrolysis of lipids can remove oxygen atoms and modify molecular structures via carbon chain cracking and aromatisation. However, this pathway has not yet been certified for the production of alternative aviation fuels. Therefore, a detailed review of various heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lipids into hydrocarbon fuels with molecular weights and structures suitable for use in aviation is presented herein, with a focus on aspects such as their physical and chemical properties, pore distributions and structures, active sites, key functions, catalytic performance, and pyrolysis mechanisms. Metal oxides can effectively remove oxygen atoms, whereas zeolites can achieve long-carbon-chain cracking to yield desirable gasoline-, kerosene-, or diesel-range fuels. Moreover, zeolites typically permit aromatisation, which yields the aromatic hydrocarbons required for liquid fuels. Modification of the pore structures of zeolites to yield hierarchical pores can improve the production of C8–C16-range liquid fuels to maximise the bio-kerosene yield. Therefore, composite catalysts (metal oxides supported on zeolites with hierarchical pores) can be effective for molecular-level structural modification in the pyrolytic production of alternative aviation fuels using lipids. However, rapid deactivation due to coking, poisoning, and sintering hinder the operation of these catalysts. Coking, which is predominantly responsible for pyrolysis catalyst deactivation, should be targeted in future research on novel catalysts. The synthetic strategy of catalysts and the mitigation of their issues are critical to the design of novel catalytic pyrolysis systems for the efficient cracking of triglyceride-rich feedstock to yield alternative aviation fuels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst poisoning; Lipids; Liquids; Molecular oxygen; Pore structure; Sintering; Zeolites; Alternative aviation fuel; Aviation fuel; Catalytic pyrolysis; Composite catalysts; Liquid hydrocarbons; Micro-algae; Non-edible lipid; Oxygen atom; Synthetic strategies; ]+ catalyst; Microalgae"

However, they also pose an environmental and health concern given their ability to undergo hydrolysis and oxidation to several bioactive and persistent products, including the perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The metabolism of PAPs has been shown to occur in mammalian liver and intestine, however metabolism by the gut microbiome has not yet been investigated. In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis. Metabolites of interest were the immediate hydrolysis product, the 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), and 11 additional metabolites previously shown to form from 8:2 FTOH in both oxic and anoxic environments. The kinetics of 8:2 monoPAP transformation by gut microbiota were compared to those in human S9 liver and intestine fractions, both of which have active levels of hydrolyzing and oxidative enzymes that transform 8:2 monoPAP. Transformation rates from 8:2 monoPAP to 8:2 FTOH were highest in liver S9 > intestine S9 > fecal suspensions. The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone ≈ perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Biomolecules; Carboxylic acids; Esters; Hydrolysis; Ketones; Mammals; Metabolism; Suspensions (fluids); Bioactives; Commercial applications; Environmental concerns; Faecal samples; Fluorotelomer alcohols; Health concerns; Human faecal; Microbiome; Perfluorocarboxylic acid; Phosphate esters; Metabolites; carboxylic acid; chemical compound; ketone; oxidoreductase; polyfluoroalkyl phosphate ester; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; surfactant; unclassified drug; ester; fluorocarbon; organophosphate; phosphate; anaerobic bacterium; Article; biotransformation; colon; controlled study; feces; feces microflora; female; human; hydrolysis; in vitro study; intestine; intestine flora; kinetics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; liver; male; metabolite; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; animal; biotransformation; liquid chromatography; mammal; metabolism; microflora; tandem mass spectrometry; Animals; Biotransformation; Carboxylic Acids; Chromatography, Liquid; Esters; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Ketones; Mammals; Microbiota; Organophosphates; Phosphates; Surface-Active Agents; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle–Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs. Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women considered healthy or with mild symptoms that may be indicative of PFDs. © 2022 by the authors.","knowledge; literature review; muscle; perception; questionnaire survey; symptom; womens status; clinical observation; data base; descriptive research; education program; educational status; English (language); evidence based medicine; experimental study; female; health education; health promotion; human; kinesiotherapy; learning; lifestyle; meta analysis; methodology; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; muscle strength; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; NOS score; outcome assessment; palpation; PEDro score; pelvic examination; pelvic floor disorder; pelvis floor muscle; practice guideline; program effectiveness; proprioception; quality control; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; scoring system; self concept; skeletal muscle contractility; Spanish (language); study design; symptom; systematic review; verbal communication; exercise; pelvic floor disorder; pelvis floor; physiology; Exercise; Female; Humans; Muscle Contraction; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires"

The utilization of LDHs towards the adsorptive removal of dyes, metals, oxyanions, and emerging pollutants is critically reviewed, while all the reported kinds of interactions that gather the removal are collectively presented. Finally, future perspectives on the topic are discussed.

In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides.

Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11% to 37% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load. © 2022","Effluent treatment; Industrial plants; Industrial water treatment; Regression analysis; Wastewater treatment; 0000; Effluent concentrations; Global patterns; Historical; Meta-analysis; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Substance concentrations; Temperature variables; Temporal trends; Wastewater effluents; Effluents; alkyl group; carboxylic acid; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; data set; effluent; meta-analysis; organic compound; suspended particulate matter; wastewater treatment plant; adsorption; aqueous solution; Article; China; concentration (parameter); effluent; environmental impact; gross national product; Kenya; liquid; municipal wastewater; phase partitioning; suspended particulate matter; trend study; United States; waste water treatment plant; water sampling; water supply; human; meta analysis; wastewater; water pollutant; China; United States; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Sulfonic Acids; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

An association of a reduction of vaccination efficacy with PFAS serum levels in humans was used by the European Food Safety Authority as a key effect for PFAS risk assessment. The data support for using this association is reviewed by a critical analysis of the respective human epidemiology and the available animal studies on the immunomodulation of PFAS. Based on an analysis of the available human epidemiology, the overall level of evidence regarding associations between PFAS serum levels and reduced antibody response remains weak. Absence of an association between an increase in clinical infections and PFAS serum levels and the limited understanding of the importance of antibody levels as an isolated data point further support this conclusion. Animal toxicity studies with PFAS focusing on immunomodulation also provide only limited support for immunomodulation as an important endpoint in PFAS toxicity. While immunomodulation is observed after PFAS administration, generally at blood concentrations several orders of magnitude above those seen in environmentally exposed humans, the relevance of these observation is hampered by the high doses required to influence immune endpoints, the limited number of endpoints assessed, and inconsistent results. The limitations of the current database on associations of human PFAS exposures outlined here indicate that more evidence is required to select immunomodulation as a critical endpoint for human PFAS risk assessment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","antibody response; blood level; controlled study; drug megadose; drug safety; environmental exposure; fluorination; food safety; human; human tissue; immunomodulation; review; risk assessment; vaccination; animal; chemistry; immunomodulation; pollutant; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Immunomodulation"

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available.

Results showed that, although H-PFMO2OSA liver and serum concentrations were lower than those of PFOS, the relative liver weight in the H-PFMO2OSA groups was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PFOS groups. In addition, the increase in alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase activity was greater in the H-PFMO2OSA groups than in the PFOS groups. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione reductase activity in the liver increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg/d H-PFMO2OSA groups and in the 5 mg/kg/d PFOS group. Liver quantitative proteome analysis demonstrated that, similar to PFOS, H-PFMO2OSA caused lipid metabolism disorder, and most lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Additionally, KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted changes in the GSH metabolism pathway after PFOS and H-PFMO2OSA exposure. Then, there were eight DEPs involved in the GSH metabolism pathway that mostly were upregulated after exposure to H-PFMO2OSA but not after exposure to PFOS. In conclusion, H-PFMO2OSA induced higher levels of liver damage and more serious GSH metabolism dysregulation compared to PFOS. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Recently, the vital role of PFSA ionomer in the local transfer of proton, oxygen, and water in fuel cell catalyst layer has been recognized, thus its properties have attracted more attention. In this review, a comprehensive comparison between PFSA bulk membrane and ultrathin PFSA ionomer film is summarized as morphology, physical properties (e.g., water uptake, surface wettability, diffusivity), and mechanical properties (e.g., crystallization, antiplasticization, glass transition point). Afterwards, the characteristics of ionomer in different dispersion media and the microstructure of PFSA ionomer in the formed catalyst layers are illuminated. The proton conduction and mass transport (i.e., oxygen and water) behaviors in the confined PFSA ionomer are focused and highlighted to reveal the ionomer's influence on fuel cell performance. Extrapolating from the insight into structural and transport properties of PFSA ionomer, we are optimistic that the performance of ultralow Pt loading PEMFCs could be greatly improved via modifying ionomer chemical structure and engineering ionomer/catalyst interaction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Glass transition; Morphology; Nanocatalysts; Oxygen; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Transport properties; Catalysts layers; Fuel-cell catalyst layers; Ionomer films; Nano scale; PEM fuel cell; Perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers; Property; Proton conduction; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Ultra-thin; Ionomers"

Such nanocomposite materials benefit from the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis to attain improved removal of pollutants from water and wastewater. Under this review, three BC-based nanocomposite photocatalysts such as BC-TiO2, BC-ZnO, and BC-spinel ferrites were considered. These nanocomposites acquire intrinsic properties to improve the practical limitations of the pristine BC and photocatalysts. The BC-based nanocomposites attained high photocatalytic activity, mechanical hardness, thermal stability, chemically non-reactive, magnetically permeable, reduced energy band gaps, improved reusability, and simplified recovery. Moreover, BC-based photocatalytic nanocomposites showed reduced recombination rates of the electron-hole pairs which are desirable for photocatalytic applications. However, the surface areas of the composites are usually smaller than that of the BC but higher than those of the pristine photocatalysts. Practically, the performances of the nanocomposites are much superior to those of the corresponding pristine components. This hybrid treatment technology is an emerging field and its industrial application is still at an early stage of the investigation. Therefore, exploring the full potential and practical applications of this technology is highly encouraging. Hence, this review focused on the critical evaluation of the most recent research on the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalytic treatment efficiency of the BC photocatalyst nanocomposites towards emerging pollutants in the aqueous medium. Moreover, the influence of various sources of BC feedstocks and their limitations on adsorption and photodegradation activities are discussed in detail. Finally, concluding remarks and future research directions are given to assist and shape the exploration of BC-based nanocomposite photocatalysts in water treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Energy gap; II-VI semiconductors; Nanocomposites; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Zinc oxide; Biochar; Effect of adsorptions; Organic micropollutants; Photo degradation; Photocatalytic nanocomposites; Spinel ferrites; Synergistic effect; Wastewater treatment technologies; Water and wastewater treatments; Water treatment technologies; Adsorption; charcoal; ferrite; nanocomposite; organic compound; spinel ferrite nanoparticle; titanium dioxide nanoparticle; unclassified drug; zinc oxide nanoparticle; charcoal; titanium; adsorption; aqueous solution; biochar; ferrite; nanocomposite; organic pollutant; photodegradation; photolysis; reaction kinetics; spinel; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water treatment; adsorption; aqueous solution; biomass; concentration (parameter); electron; hardness; industrial waste; magnetism; mechanical hardness; municipal wastewater; photocatalysis; photodegradation; Review; surface area; synthesis; thermostability; waste component removal; waste water management; water analysis; water pollutant; catalysis; chemistry; pollutant; wastewater; Catalysis; Charcoal; Environmental Pollutants; Nanocomposites; Titanium; Waste Water"

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

PFAS consists of a fully or partly fluorinated carbon–fluorine bond, which is hard to break and requires a high amount of energy (536 kJ/mole). Resulting from their unique hydrophobic/oleophobic nature and their chemical and mechanical stability, they are highly resistant to thermal, chemical, and biological degradation. PFAS have been used extensively worldwide since the 1940s in various products such as non-stick household items, food-packaging, cosmetics, electronics, and firefighting foams. Exposure to PFAS may lead to health issues such as hormonal imbalances, a compromised immune system, cancer, fertility disorders, and adverse effects on fetal growth and learning ability in children. To date, very few novel membrane approaches have been reported effective in removing and destroying PFAS. Therefore, this article provides a critical review of PFAS treatment and removal approaches by membrane separation systems. We discuss recently reported novel and effective membrane techniques for PFAS separation and include a detailed discussion of parameters affecting PFAS membrane separation and destruction. Moreover, an estimation of cost analysis is also included for each treatment technology. Additionally, since the PFAS treatment technology is still growing, we have incorporated several future directions for efficient PFAS treatment. © 2022 by the authors.

In African countries like Nigeria, the evidence to inform plastic pollution management is scanty. This rapid review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence on the distribution, sources, biological effects, research gaps and policy needs of plastic pollution in various environmental matrices in Nigeria. Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, meso- and macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) (n = 12), macroplastics (n = 12) or both (n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land. Only 15 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had any data on micro- and/or macroplastics. Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments. Microplastic data in biota were limited to selected fish species, aquatic insects and gastropods. Only one (1) study on plastics in waterbodies in Northern Nigeria (Kogi State) was found. Research gaps on plastic distribution in terrestrial biota, other aquatic biota, soil, air, ground and potable water sources as well as biological effects were identified. Policy needs for plastic pollution management identified include stakeholder education, polymer replacement, recycling, tax and incentives to support the sustainability of life below water and on land (UN SDGs 14 and 15). © 2022 The Author(s)",

Several EDCs alter the central regulation of neuroendocrine pathways, and affect neurological functions, and as such can be classified as neurotoxic molecules. Environmental pollutants classified as EDCs and affecting the central nervous system include perfluoroalcanes, parabens, phthalates, organotins, bisphenols, benzophenones, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins. In this review we provide a brief description of these families of EDCs. We report and compare the EDC concentrations measured in the brain of humans and wild animals naturally exposed to these molecules, as well as in the brain of laboratory animals experimentally exposed to EDCs. The importance of using sophisticated analytical tools to detect EDCs in the brain is pointed out. The ability of blood-brain interfaces to reduce the brain exposition to EDCs in adult and during development is discussed in relation with the specific morphological, transport and metabolic properties of these cellular layers. Finally, we review the evidence that the neuroprotective functions of blood-brain interfaces can be altered by EDCs, a process that may participate to the central toxic action of these molecules. Overall this analysis points to the implication of blood-brain interfaces in setting the extent of central EDCs toxicity, although most evidence is indirect. Therefore, more specific blood-brain interface-oriented studies are called for in this field of EDC neurotoxicology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzophenone; dimethoxane; endocrine disruptor; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; endocrine disruptor; polychlorinated biphenyl; Article; blood brain barrier; brain toxicity; environmental exposure; in vivo study; mass spectrometry; neurotoxicity; neurotoxicology; nonhuman; pregnancy; Western blotting; adult; animal; blood brain barrier; human; neuroendocrine system; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Neurosecretory Systems; Polychlorinated Biphenyls"

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based &amp; no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Fish; Liquids; Meats; Moderators; Oils and fats; Tissue; Water; Cooking time; Data synthesis; Human exposures; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; POP; Substance concentrations; Cooking; carbon; chemical compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; water; alkanesulfonic acid; carbon; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); food quality; literature review; meta-analysis; organofluorine; persistent organic pollutant; seafood; concentration (parameter); cooking; data synthesis; effect size; food analysis; food contamination; food intake; freshwater fish; human; nonhuman; practice guideline; raw food; Review; sea food; systematic review; temperature sensitivity; animal; cooking; fish; meta analysis; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Carbon; Cooking; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Seafood"

However, this negative effect would gradually weaken with the adaptation of microorganisms. For the 50 mg/L PFOA experimental group, the proteins content in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the anaerobic granular sludge increased from 1.53 mg/g to 3.65 mg/g.

Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = −1.34 to −0.57), hip external rotation (−0.55;-1.07 to −0.03), hip extension (−0.72;-1.16 to −0.28), and knee extension (−0.97;-1.41 to −0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls.

Perfluorochemicals have also been detected in human and animals due to direct or indirect exposures, giving rise to health concerns. This review aims to examine the bioremediation of perfluorochemicals with plants, bacteria and fungi, including their efficiency and limitations. It also aims to propose the future prospects of bioremediation of perfluorochemicals. This review retrieved peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2021 from journal databases consisting of Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect. This review shows that multiple Pseudomonas species could degrade perfluorochemicals particularly perfluoroalkyl acids under aerobic condition. Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation.

Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications. However, there is insufficient data to suggest that either nail construct is associated with better functional outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article; clinical outcome; comparative effectiveness; device migration; femur intertrochanteric fracture; fluoroscopy; Harris hip score; hip pain; human; meta analysis; osteosynthesis; pain; prospective study; radiological procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; rotation; systematic review; thigh pain; adverse event; bone nail; bone screw; diagnostic imaging; femur fracture; hip fracture; hip replacement; intramedullary nailing; treatment outcome; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; Femoral Fractures; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Hip Fractures; Humans; Treatment Outcome"

Typical water and wastewater treatment processes (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are proven to be largely ineffective, while adsorption with granular activated carbon (GAC) has been the chief option to capture them from aqueous sources followed by incineration. However, this process is time-consuming, and produces additional solid waste and air pollution. Treatment methods for PFOS and PFOA generally follow two routes: (1) removal from source and reduce the risk; (2) degradation. Emerging technologies focusing on degradation are critically reviewed in this contribution. Various processes such as bioremediation, electrocoagulation, foam fractionation, sonolysis, photocatalysis, mechanochemical, electrochemical degradation, beams of electron and plasma have been developed and studied in the past decade to address PFAS crisis. The underlying mechanisms of these PFAS degradation methods have been categorized. Two main challenges have been identified, namely complexity in large scale operation and the release of toxic byproducts. Based on the literature survey, we have provided a strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis and quantitative rating on their efficiency, environmental impact and technology readiness. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioremediation; Chemical water treatment; Coagulation; Waste incineration; Wastewater treatment; Literature reviews; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; PFAA treatment technology; PFAS degradation; PFAS removal; Quantitative rating; Strength-weakness-opportunity-threat analyse; Strengths/weakness/opportunities/threats; Threats analysis; Treatment technologies; Environmental technology; hydroxyl group; hydroxyl radical; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfate; sulfite; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; atmospheric pollution; degradation; human activity; literature review; solid waste; strength; water treatment; biomimetics; bioremediation; commercial phenomena; degradation; dehalogenation; electrocoagulation; electron beam; environmental impact; Fenton reaction; filtration; foam; fractionation; gamma radiation; landfill leachate; microwave irradiation; oxidation; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; photocatalysis; photochemistry; photolysis; plasma gas; process optimization; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; risk reduction; technology; ultraviolet radiation; waste component removal; human; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Xenobiotic metabolism, transformation, excretion, and coexistence with other endogenous molecules, however, greatly complicate the interpretation of features detected in nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites from xenobiotics is also often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS), mass defect filtering, and machine learning to uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species in large metabolomic feature lists. Xenobiotic classes examined included those of known high toxicities, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pesticides. Specifically, when the workflow was applied to identify PFAS in the NIST SRM 1957 and 909c human serum samples, it greatly reduced the hundreds of detected liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-MS features by utilizing both mass defect filtering and m/z versus IMS collision cross sections relationships. These potential PFAS features were then compared to the EPA CompTox entries, and while some matched within specific m/z tolerances, there were still many unknowns illustrating the importance of nontargeted studies for detecting new molecules with known chemical characteristics. Additionally, this workflow can also be utilized to evaluate other xenobiotics and enable more confident annotations from nontargeted studies. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Mathematical modelling can be a useful tool as a comprehensive approach to study their fate and transport in natural waters. However, modelling studies of the occurrence, fate and transport of ECs in aquatic environments have generally received far less attention than the more widespread field and laboratory studies. In this study, we reviewed the current status of modelling ECs based on selected representative ECs, including their sources, fate and various mechanisms as well as their interactions with the surrounding environments in aquatic ecosystems, and explore future development and perspectives in this area. Most importantly, the principles, mathematical derivations, ongoing development and applications of various ECs models in different geographical regions are critically reviewed and discussed. The recommendations for improving data quality, monitoring planning, model development and applications were also suggested.

We examined the potential causal role of acylcarnitine metabolism in depression by leveraging genomics and Mendelian randomization. Methods: Summary statistics were obtained from large GWAS: the Fenland Study (N = 9363), and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (246,363 depression cases and 561,190 controls). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses tested the potential causal link of 15 endogenous acylcarnitines with depression. Results: In univariable analyses, genetically-predicted lower levels of short-chain acylcarnitines C2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.95–1.00) and C3 (OR 0.97, 95%CIs 0.96–0.99) and higher levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines C8 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.01–1.06) and C10 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02–1.06) were associated with increased depression risk. No reverse potential causal role of depression genetic liability on acylcarnitines levels was found. Multivariable analyses showed that the association with depression was driven by the medium-chain acylcarnitines C8 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02–1.06) and C10 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02–1.06), suggesting a potential causal role in the risk of depression. Causal estimates for C8 (OR = 1.05, 95%CIs = 1.02–1.07) and C10 (OR = 1.05, 95%CIs = 1.02–1.08) were confirmed in follow-up analyses using genetic instruments derived from a GWAS meta-analysis including up to 16,841 samples. Discussion: Accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines is a signature of inborn errors of fatty acid metabolism and age-related metabolic conditions. Our findings point to a link between altered mitochondrial energy production and depression pathogenesis.

Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates.

This systematic review study, using the Scopus da-tabase, provides an insightful understanding of the spatial distribution of scientific studies on MPs in freshwater conducted across the Asian region, utilized sampling methods, and a detailed assessment of the effects of MPs on different biotic components in freshwater ecosystems, with special focus on its potential risks on human health. The results of this review indicate that research on microplastics in Asia has gained attention since 2014, with a significant increase in the number of studies in 2018, and the number of scientific studies quadrupled in 2021 compared to 2018. Results indicated that despite a significant amount of research has been conducted in many Asian countries, they were not distributed evenly, as multiple studies selected specific rivers and lakes. Additionally, around two-thirds of all the papers focused their studies in China, followed by India and South Korea. It was also found that most of the studies focused primarily on reporting the occurrence levels of MPs in freshwater systems, such as water and sediments, and aquatic organisms, with a lack of studies investigating the human intake of MPs and their potential risks to human health. Notably, comparing the results is a challenge because diverse sampling, separation, and identification methods were applied to estimate MPs. This review study suggests that further research on the dynamics and transport of microplastics in biota and humans is needed, as Asia is a major consumer of seafood products and contributes significantly to the generation of plastic litter in the marine environment. Moreover, this review study revealed that only a few studies extended their discus-sions to policies and governance aspects of MPs. This implies the need for further research on policy and governance frameworks to address this emerging water pollutant more holistically. © 2022 by the authors.

The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 – 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 – 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H2 as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 – 40 µM. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 – 500 kHz), concentration (&gt;15 – 40 μM), temperature (≈20 °C), and pH range (3.2 – 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F− is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO42− and CO2 by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g−1 PFAS). It is concluded that sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a treatment train for improved efficiency. © 2022 The Authors","Carboxylation; Diseases; Mineralogy; Reaction intermediates; Reaction kinetics; Intermediate product; Literature reviews; Meta-analysis; Mineralisation; Parametric; Poly fluoroalkyl substance; Power; Rate-limiting steps; Sonolysis; Ultrasonic degradation; Degradation; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carboxylic acid; chemical compound; fluoride; fluorine; hydrogen; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluoroether carboxylate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; radical; sulfate; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; water; adsorption; biodegradation; biotransformation; carbon balance; chemical structure; comparative study; concentration (parameter); contamination; defluorination; degradation; dilution; fire fighter; fluorination; foam; frequency; gas; gas chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrophobicity; kinetics; landfill leachate; mass spectrometry; methodology; mineralization; oxidation; pH; reaction analysis; Review; sonolysis; stoichiometry; temperature; ultrasound; wastewater; human; meta analysis; water pollutant; Adsorption; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Diverse dehalogenase genes were present in all analyzed metagenomes, with reductive dehalogenase and haloalkane dehalogenase genes the most common. Taxonomic analysis of both hydrolytic and reductive dehalogenase genes was performed to explore their affiliation; this analysis indicated that at the SUIM site, hydrolytic dehalogenase genes were taxonomically affiliated with Marinobacter species. Because of this affiliation, experiments were also performed with Marinobacter subterrani strain JG233 ('JG233'), an organism containing three predicted hydrolytic dehalogenase genes and isolated from the SUIM site, to determine whether hydrolytic dehalogenation was an active process and involved in growth on a chlorocarboxylic acid. Presence of these genes in genome appears to be functional, as JG233 was capable of chloroacetate dechlorination with simultaneous chloride release. Stable isotope experiments combined with confocal Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated that JG233 incorporated carbon from 13C-chloroacetate into its biomass. These experiments suggest that organisms present in these extreme and often low-carbon environments are capable of reductive and hydrolytic dechlorination and, based on laboratory experiments, may use this capability as a competitive advantage by utilizing chlorinated organic compounds for growth, either directly or after dechlorination. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Methods: A recall-by-genotype study was implemented in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Samples from 756 participants were selected for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on low versus high genetic liability for higher BMI defined by a genetic risk score (GRS). Regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between BMI GRS group and relative abundance of 973 metabolites. Results: After correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GRS group. Bilirubin was among the most strongly associated metabolites, with reduced levels measured in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.32, 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.005). This study observed associations between BMI GRS group and the levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites, including hippurate, which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.29, 95% CI: −0.44 to −0.15, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.008). Conclusions: Together with existing literature, these results suggest that a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain. In the absence of prospective data, separating these effects from the downstream consequences of weight gain is challenging. © 2022 The Authors.

Post-surgical imaging of mesh is useful when complications including mesh erosion, bleeding, and chronic pain arise. Different types of mesh coated with various materials have been developed to improve visibility on imaging studies. However, localization of surgical mesh after implantation remains challenging as visualization with standard imaging is difficult. The purpose of this study was to review the various radiologic approaches to characterizing synthetic surgical meshes. Recent Findings: A systematic and comprehensive literature search was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine to identify all potentially relevant publications published before April 2020. Studies assessing the use of imaging for surgical mesh in both urogynecologic and non-urogyneocologic procedures were included. Iron impregnated mesh was most visible on imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Impregnated mesh was also shown to be more readily visible on ultrasound when compared to its non-iron containing counterpart. Non-impregnated expanded polytetrafluorethylene mesh (EPTF Mesh) was visible on CT and MRI. The more commonly used polypropylene and polyvinylidene mesh were more readily visualized on ultrasound although localization of surrounding structures remains difficult. Summary: Imaging surgical mesh poses an ongoing problem when complications arise. Although particle impregnated mesh is visible on CT and MRI, the adoption of this practice is still in its infancy. The ability to visualize EPTF mesh on CT and MRI is a promising advancement, but proper visualization of the more common synthetic meshes remains a limitation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","biological product; iron oxide; polypropylene; polytetrafluoroethylene; bleeding; chronic pain; computer assisted tomography; cystocele; echography; female; hernioplasty; human; implantation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiography; Review; systematic review; urine incontinence; urological procedure"

These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022","Contamination; Environmental technology; Learning systems; Risk assessment; 'omics'; Chemical exposure; Chemical risk assessment; Contaminant exposure; Environmental epidemiology; Epidemiological studies; Population exposure; Study design; Systematic evidence map; ‘omic; Molecular biology; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; metal; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid derivative; volatile organic compound; epidemiology; map; public health; risk assessment; air pollutant; data base; environmental exposure; environmental impact; epidemiology; epigenetics; health risk assessment; human; metabolomics; persistent organic pollutant; proteomics; Review; scientific literature; systematic review; toxicokinetics; transcriptomics; adverse event; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; reference value; risk assessment; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Reference Values; Risk Assessment"

Environmental effects on the immune system may influence human susceptibility to respiratory infections as well as the severity of infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the efficacy of vaccines to respiratory diseases may be impacted by environmental exposures through immune perturbations. Given the quick pace of research about COVID-19 and associated risk factors, it is critical to identify and curate the streams of evidence quickly and effectively. Objective: We developed this systematic evidence map protocol to identify and organize existing human and animal literature on high-priority environmental chemical classes (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, phthalates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and air pollutants) and their potential to influence three key outcomes: (1) susceptibility to respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV-2 (2) severity of the resultant disease progression, and (3) impact on vaccine efficacy. The result of this project will be an online, interactive database which will show what evidence is currently available between involuntary exposures to select environmental chemicals and immune health effects, data gaps that require further research, and data rich areas that may support further analysis. Search and study eligibility: We will search PubMed for epidemiological or toxicological literature on select toxicants from each of the chemical classes and each of the three outcomes listed above. Study appraisal and synthesis of methods: For each study, two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening as well as full text review for data extraction of study characteristics.

It is a promising impurity adsorption material, which has potential application value in the agricultural environment fields such as soil improvement and sewage purification. The composite can combine the advantages of biochar with chitosan, and the resulting composite usually exhibits a great improvement in its surface functional groups, adsorption sites, stability, and adsorption properties. In addition, compared to other adsorbents, the composite truly achieves the concept of “waste control by waste”. In this paper, the preparation method, composite classification, adsorption mechanism, and models of biochar modified by chitosan are introduced, meanwhile, we also review and summarize their effects on the decontamination of wastewater and soil. In addition to common heavy metal ions, we also review the adsorption and removal of some other organic/inorganic pollutants, including (1) drug residues; (2) dyes; (3) phosphates; (4) radionuclides; (5) perfluorochemicals, etc. Moreover, challenges and prospects for the composite are presented and further studies are called for the chitosan-biochar composite.

EPs are detected in all the environmental matrices at higher levels. A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species.

These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30–0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology","chemical compound; hexafluoroethane; perflutren; silicone oil; sulfur hexafluoride; unclassified drug; adverse event; air; body position; cataract; consensus; data base; data extraction; gas; GRADE approach; human; idiopathic disease; internal limiting membrane; meta analysis; outcome assessment; prospective study; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); retina macula hole; Review; risk assessment; selection bias; surgeon; systematic review; vision; vitrectomy; retina; retina tear; visual acuity; vitrectomy; Humans; Retina; Retinal Perforations; Silicone Oils; Visual Acuity; Vitrectomy"

Environmental contaminants – aromatic compounds, mycotoxins and phytotoxins like aristolochic acids (AAs) – polluting food and drinking water sources, were incriminated in BEN, due to their nephrotoxic and carcinogenic properties. The implication of AAs in BEN etiology is currently a highly debated topic due to the fact that they are found within the Aristolochiaceae plants family, used around the globe as traditional medicine and they were also incriminated in Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy (AAN). Exposure pathways have been investigated, but it is unclear to what extent AAs are acting alone or in synergy with other cofactors (environmental, genetics) in triggering kidney damage. Experimental studies strengthen the hypothesis that AAI, the most studied compound in the AAs class, is a significant environmental contaminant and a most important causative factor of BEN. The aim of this review is to compile information about the natural exposure pathways to AAI, via traditional medicinal plants, soil, crop plants, water, food, air. Data that either supports or contradicts the AAI theory concerning BEN etiology was consolidated and available solutions to reduce human exposure were discussed. Because AAI is a phytotoxin with physicochemical properties that allow its transportation in environmental matrices from different types of areas (endemic, nonendemic), and induce CKDs (BEN, AAN) and urinary cancers through bioaccumulation, this review aims to shed a new light on this compound as a biogenic emerging pollutant. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemistry; Contamination; Crops; Diseases; Mycotoxins; Physicochemical properties; Water absorption; Aristolochia clematiti; Aristolochic acid; Balkan endemic nephropathy; Balkans; Biogenics; Chronic kidney disease; Exposure pathways; Nephropathy; Phytotoxins; Urothelial cancer; Potable water; aristolochic acid; aristololactam; aromatic compound; biological marker; carbon nanotube; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mycotoxin; nanocomposite; ochratoxin; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; aristolochic acid; aristolochic acid I; cancer; carcinogen; chronic wasting disease; drinking water; environmental factor; etiology; experimental study; medicinal plant; physicochemical property; toxin; Aristolochia; aristolochic acid nephropathy; Article; Balkan endemic nephropathy; bioaccumulation; bladder cancer; body weight loss; carcinogenic activity; chronic kidney failure; contamination; diabetes mellitus; dry skin; dyspnea; environmental health; ethnopharmacology; exposure; headache; human; hypertension; kidney injury; kidney transplantation; mass fragmentography; nausea; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; paresthesia; pollutant; renal cell carcinoma; renal replacement therapy; solid phase extraction; supercritical fluid extraction; thorax pain; transitional cell carcinoma; ultra performance liquid chromatography; vomiting; environmental health; female; interstitial nephritis; male; Balkan; Turkmenistan; Aristolochic Acids; Balkan Nephropathy; Environmental Health; Female; Humans; Male; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"

Diseases like cancer, cardiovascular risk, behavioral disorders, autoimmune defects, and reproductive diseases are related to these endocrine disruptors. Because these chemicals exist in known sources such as pharmaceuticals and plasticizers, as well as non-point sources such as agricultural runoff and storm water infiltration, the interactive effects of EDCs are gaining attention. However, the efficiency of conventional treatment methods is not sufficient to fully remediate EDCs from aqueous environments as the occurrence of EDC bioremediation and biodegradation is detected in remediated drinking water. Incorporating modification into current remediation techniques has to overcome challenges such as high energy consumption and health risks resulting from conventional treatment. Hence, the use of advanced psychochemical and biological treatments such as carbon-based adsorption, membrane technology, nanostructured photocatalysts, microbial and enzyme technologies is crucial. Intensifying environmental and health concerns about these mixed contaminants are primarily due to the lack of laws about acute concentration limits of these EDCs in municipal wastewater, groundwater, surface water, and drinking water. This review article offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the source, fate, toxicity, ecological and human health impact, remediation techniques, and mechanisms during EDC removal, and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of EDCs in the environment.

Cytostatic drugs are emerging pollutants used for cancer treatment found in hospital and domestic wastewater. Small amounts of cytostatic pollutants may pose severe health problems in human beings, animals, and plants after prolonged contact. This research presents a general review of some water treatment methods, such as aerobic activated sludge, enzymatic degradation, nanofiltration and chlorination, that have been used for the degradation or elimination of cytostatic drugs in wastewater. In recent years, photocatalysis has become important to solve this problem; these advanced oxidation process uses pure and modified TiO2 to degrade cytostatic contaminants and convert them into non-harmful substances or to eliminate them completely. This work contains a comprehensive review of the heterogeneous photocatalysis process and mechanism, and its application on the removal of cytostatic pollutants. Even if research on the topic is still scarce, this literature review provides interesting highlights on the scope of the research field, and the path such research could follow. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","biodegradation; cancer; catalysis; chemical compound; drug; literature review; oxidation; photolysis; wastewater treatment; cytostatic agent; titanium; titanium dioxide; animal; catalysis; pollutant; wastewater; water pollutant; Animals; Catalysis; Cytostatic Agents; Environmental Pollutants; Titanium; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Current treatment options show unsatisfactory results and new ones are therefore needed. Stem cell (SC) therapy might be an alternative treatment strategy. This systematic review aims to define the state of art of SC therapy for PFDs in clinical trials, by systematically reviewing the available evidence. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to November 7, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. Preclinical studies on animal models were not considered. Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites. However, a clear beneficial impact of SC treatment for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders could not be demonstrated. Further larger targeted studies with control arms are needed before any conclusions can be made. © 2021, The Author(s).","adipose derived stem cell; adipose tissue; adult; Austria; Canada; clinical trial (topic); Cochrane Library; coughing; data extraction; dysuria; electromyogram; eligibility criteria; feces incontinence; female; Finland; follow up; graft harvesting; hematoma; human; ICIQ (incontinence); information retrieval; injection; Iran; Korea; male; manometry; Medline; mixed incontinence; muscle tissue; outcome assessment; pelvic floor disorder; periurethral injection; Poland; preclinical study; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Scopus; Short Form 36; side effect; Spain; stem cell transplantation; stress incontinence; systematic review; transurethral injection; transvaginal periurethral injection; umbilical cord blood; urodynamics; Web of Science; Wexner score; animal; pelvis floor; quality of life; stem cell; Animals; Female; Humans; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Stem Cells"

Objective: We conducted a literature review on the bulking agents used in the treatment of SUI, their indications and the different techniques of injection. Material and methods: The literature review followed PRISMA guidelines. We used the Mesh terms: urinary, incontinence, and bulking to search the PubMed database, from the date of conception until June 2020. All studies modalities were included and references lists were also reviewed for relevant articles. Our search identified 60 articles published between 2001 and 2020. References lists review allowed the addition of 40 more articles. In total, 54 articles were included in the descriptive analysis. Results: Bulking agents that are used nowadays are the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen, polydimethylsiloxane, calcium hydroxyapatite, porcine dermal implants, carbon coated zirconium beads, and the polyacrylamide hydrogel. Cure rates of bulking agents are lower compared to surgical management. Periurethral injection was found to be beneficial in patients who refuse or who are inadequate for surgical management, or after the failure of the latter. It can be performed via paraurethral or transurethral routes, with comparable efficacy. Ultrasonic, radiographic or endoscopic assistance allow better precision and control of the procedure. Paraurethral route is associated with bigger injected volumes, higher costs, and more complications. Studies showed superiority of the injections in the mid-urethra, in horseshoe or circumferential template. Conclusion: The identification of optimal bulking agent is difficult. The choice of the agent currently depends on the availability, doctor's preference, cost, and the ease of use. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SASContexte: L'injection peri-urétrale d'agents comblant est une option thérapeutique peu invasive pour l'incontinence urinaire d'effort (IUE).

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","fluorocarbon; adult; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; human; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome"

Advanced analytical methodology in use basically relies on the application of mass spectrometry to enable identification and quantification of hazardous chemical species, directly or after separation using the principles of gas and liquid chromatography. Also addressed are sample preparation techniques which – given the complexity of sediment matrices and the diverse and multiple nature of contaminants – are often a key for successful analysis.

Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Furthermore, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA significantly up-regulating mRNA and protein levels of Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Mff, but did not change Drp1.

PFAS concentrations were compiled for WWTPs in the United States from peer-reviewed studies, technical reports, and original data. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased by an average of 6.0 ± 1.6 ng/L from the influents to the effluents of WWTPs, but perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) did not significantly change, indicating sorption to sludge is offset by biotransformation of precursor compounds. The occurrence of individual PFAS may vary temporally; for example, perfluoropentanoic acid correlated weakly with seasonal temperatures at a site in Virginia. Wastewater effluent PFOA concentrations decreased at a site in Nevada from 2012 to February 2020 but appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effluent PFOA also declined nationally from 1999 to 2020 by ∼13% per year. Nevertheless, the national mean PFOA concentration was 8.4 ± 0.4 ng/L in data collected from 2013 to 2020 with outliers omitted, indicating persisting low-level occurrence.

Remediation of environmental PFAS contamination and their presence in consumer products have led to the production of solid and liquid waste streams containing high concentrations of PFASs, which require efficient and cost-effective treatment solutions. PFASs are challenging to defluorinate by conventional and advanced destructive treatment processes, and physical separation processes produce waste streams (e.g., membrane concentrate, spent activated carbon) requiring further post-treatment. Incineration and other thermal treatment processes are widely available, but their use in managing PFAS-containing wastes remains poorly understood. Under specific operating conditions, thermal treatment is expected to mineralize PFASs, but the degradation mechanisms and pathways are unknown. In this review, we critically evaluate the thermal decomposition mechanisms, pathways, and byproducts of PFASs that are crucial to the design and operation of thermal treatment processes. We highlight the analytical capabilities and challenges and identify research gaps which limit the current understanding of safely applying thermal treatment to destroy PFASs as a viable end-of-life treatment process. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Legislation with aim to eliminate and ban EDs have been introduced in EU, but the identification of EDs remains challenging and crucial step towards regulation and risk management. A guidance for ED assessment has been recently established for pesticides and biocides in the EU, which heavily relies on traditional toxicological testing in vivo. Most notably lacking mechanistic methods for some ED modalities and not covering many other modalities that might be affected by EDs. In this project, we focus on the ED assessment according to the valid legislation and explore the possibility to employ alternative methods to bolster the mechanistic understanding of the ED effects and eventually decrease the need for in vivo testing. We selected a well-studied industrial chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to be a model compound in a case study for ED assessment where the EU criteria were applied in the frame of human health risk assessment with focus on thyroid disruption and developmental neurotoxicity. A systematic literature review has been conducted for these effects (Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), and relevant studies were selected by title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. Selected studies were assessed for reliability (SciRAP), and all relevant data were extracted into a database and assessed by Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach. The initial analysis showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria. The use of mechanistic and alternative methods enhanced the outcomes of WoE assessment.

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs.

To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1–64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider. Overall, the high prevalence of arsenic above the MPL in Guatemala City tap water represents a potential health risk that current water treatment processes are not optimized to remove. Furthermore, potential contaminants from premise plumbing and storage, including lead and PFAS, represent additional risks requiring further investigation and public engagement. © 2022 by the authors.

The prevailing view is that obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure caused by overeating and insufficient exercise. We describe another environmental element that can alter the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure: obesogens. Obesogens are a subset of environmental chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors affecting metabolic endpoints. The obesogen hypothesis posits that exposure to endocrine disruptors and other chemicals can alter the development and function of the adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and brain, thus changing the set point for control of metabolism. Obesogens can determine how much food is needed to maintain homeostasis and thereby increase the susceptibility to obesity. The most sensitive time for obesogen action is in utero and early childhood, in part via epigenetic programming that can be transmitted to future generations. This review explores the evidence supporting the obesogen hypothesis and highlights knowledge gaps that have prevented widespread acceptance as a contributor to the obesity pandemic. Critically, the obesogen hypothesis changes the narrative from curing obesity to preventing obesity. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; agricultural chemical; alcohol derivative; alkylphenol; androgen receptor; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; arsenic; aspartame; atrazine; butyl paraben; butylated hydroxyanisole; cadmium; carboxymethylcellulose; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; constitutive androstane receptor; dibutyltin; dimpylate; dioxin; endocrine disruptor; endrin; estrogen receptor; flame retardant; fructose; fungicide; glucocorticoid receptor; glucuronide; glutamate sodium; glyphosate; methyl paraben; neonicotinoid; nicotine; nonnutritive sweetener; perfluoro compound; permethrin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pesticide; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polysorbate 80; pregnane X receptor; retinoid X receptor; saccharin; sirtuin; sucralose; tributyltin; triclosan; adipocyte; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; air pollution; Article; body weight gain; brain; caloric intake; causality; chicken; circadian rhythm; disease predisposition; energy expenditure; environmental exposure; epigenetics; feeding behavior; food addiction; gastrointestinal tract; homeostasis; house dust; human; hypothesis; in vitro study; inflammation; inheritance; intestine flora; liver; mitochondrion; nonhuman; obesity; obesogenic environment; oxidative stress; pancreas; passive smoking; rodent model; skeletal muscle; smoking; Western diet; zebra fish; adverse event; environmental exposure; obesity; preschool child; Adipogenesis; Adipose Tissue; Child, Preschool; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Obesity"

Humans are continuously exposed to POPs through diet, air particles, and household and commercial products; POPs are consistently detected in human tissues, including the pancreas. Epidemiological studies show a modest but consistent correlation between exposure to POPs and increased diabetes risk. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of epidemiological evidence and an in-depth evaluation of the in vivo and in vitro evidence that POPs cause β-cell toxicity. We review evidence for six classes of POPs: dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The available data provide convincing evidence implicating POPs as a contributing factor driving impaired glucose homeostasis, β-cell dysfunction, and altered metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in islets. These findings support epidemiological data showing that POPs increase diabetes risk and emphasize the need to consider the endocrine pancreas in toxicity assessments. Our review also highlights significant gaps in the literature assessing islet-specific endpoints after both in vivo and in vitro POP exposure. In addition, most rodent studies do not consider the impact of biological sex or secondary metabolic stressors in mediating the effects of POPs on glucose homeostasis and β-cell function. We discuss key gaps and limitations that should be assessed in future studies.

However, the clinical profile of C8 radiculopathy is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of C8 radiculopathy after cervicothoracic osteotomies and to form a clinical profile describing the characteristics through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: An electronic database search for full-text English articles was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The search yielded results on indications for cervicothoracic osteotomies, surgical approaches, mean follow-up time, and significant complications, including C8 radiculopathy. Results: Our literature search yielded 2135 articles, of which 12 qualified to be included in the analysis. The 12 articles comprised 451 patients undergoing various osteotomy approaches. The mean age of subjects was 51.0 years (range, 11.4–63.2 years), and the majority of patients were male (66%, n = 298). Ankylosing spondylitis was the most frequent indication for surgery (44.8%, n = 202). The number of patients with postoperative C8 radiculopathy was found to decrease over time (1997–2020) by showing statistical significance (r = −0.65, P = 0.021). Conclusions: Of the 451 patients included in this study, 53 had C8 radiculopathy (11.8% of the total patient population). Moreover, the rate of C8 radiculopathy decreased over time in a statistically significant manner. An understanding of the factors associated with the incidence of C8 radiculopathy is essential for future improvement of patient outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","mannitol; mecobalamin; adult; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; cervicobrachial neuralgia; cervicothoracic osteotomy; child; conservative treatment; dysphagia; female; follow up; human; kyphosis; male; meta analysis; middle aged; osteotomy; paresthesia; postoperative complication; school child; spinal cord disease; spine surgery; surgical approach; surgical infection; systematic review; treatment outcome; adolescent; adverse event; ankylosing spondylitis; factual database; osteotomy; postoperative period; radiculopathy; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Osteotomy; Postoperative Period; Radiculopathy; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Young Adult"

Therefore, nano/microplastics pollution has become a global issue, making their definitive elimination compulsory. Self-propelled nano/microrobots have demonstrated efficient removal of nano/microplastics from water, combining enhanced physicochemical properties of nano/microscale materials and active motion. During the last year, the potential of this technology to degrade nano/microplastics has been investigated.

EDC removal from wastewaters is highly dependent on physicochemical properties of the given EDCs present in each wastewater types as well as various aquatic environments. Due to chemical, physical and physicochemical diversities in these parameters, variety of technologies consisting of physical, biological, electrochemical, and chemical processes have been developed for their removal. This review highlights that the effectiveness of EDC removal is highly dependent of selecting the appropriate technology; which decision is made upon a full wastewater chemical characterization. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective about all the current technologies used for EDCs removal from various aquatic matrices along with rising challenges such as the antimicrobial resistance gene transfer during EDC treatment. © 2021 The Authors","adsorbent; antibiotic agent; carbon nanotube; endocrine disruptor; endocrine disruptor; aqueous solution; detection method; endocrine disruptor; gene transfer; landfill; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; wastewater; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; adsorption; anaerobic sludge; antibiotic resistance; appropriate technology; Article; chlorination; electrocoagulation; filtration; gene transfer; human; lagoon; membrane technology; microalga; nonhuman; oxidation; ozonation; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; plasma gas; sanitation; static electricity; waste water management; water supply; water treatment; sewage; technology; wastewater; water pollutant; Endocrine Disruptors; Humans; Technology; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","arthroplasty; blood transfusion; cost effectiveness analysis; follow up; health care cost; hospital patient; human; intermethod comparison; knee arthritis; meta analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; patellofemoral arthritis; patellofemoral arthroplasty; patient satisfaction; patient selection; postoperative complication; postoperative period; quality adjusted life year; reoperation; Review; risk factor; systematic review; total knee arthroplasty; treatment outcome; visual analog scale; knee osteoarthritis; knee replacement; patellofemoral joint; procedures; retrospective study; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Humans; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellofemoral Joint; Patient Satisfaction; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome"

The largest surface area (571 m2/g) and pore volume (0.65 cm3/g) were obtained from the N2 physisorption analysis of 1 wt.% Sn-promoted catalyst (E). Cu2O and CuO were identified in the X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of all the catalysts except for catalyst E, which revealed only the peaks of Cu2O owing to the small particle size of CuO below the threshold of detection of XRD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of both oxidized and reduced phases of Cu, Fe, Ti, Zr and Sn in their respective catalysts, with the highest and lowest atomic compositions of reduced Fe and CuO, respectively, detected in catalyst E; corroborating findings from XRD analyses. The relatively homogeneous dispersion of phases present in catalyst E (revealed by its smallest crystallite size of 5.1 nm) was also evidenced by the weakest metal-support interaction from the H2-TPR analysis of the same catalyst. Hydroprocessing of oleic acid using catalyst E at 320 °C under H2 pressure of 2.1 MPa and reaction time of 8 h resulted in the highest aviation turbine fuel range hydrocarbons selectivity of 76.8 % and yield of 71.7 %.

Given their unique hydrophobicity, oil-repellence, and chemical stability, PFASs are widely used in various industrial and commercial products. PFASs can accumulate and be biomagnified through the food chain, and its toxic effects have posed a certain threat to human health. The response of the immune system to PFASs exposure is one of the most sensitive human health effects, and has attracted remarkable attention from related scientists and organizations. We summarized international and domestic epidemiological studies on the associations between exposure to PFASs and immune system, including immunosuppression and immunoenhancement. We also reviewed experimental evidence of PFASs on immune system from perspectives of immune organs, immune cells, and cytokines. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α)-dependent, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-activated, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways were summarized. While the relationships between PFASs and immune-related diseases in human are not yet conclusive, accumulative epidemiological studies provide evidence for associations between PFASs and reduced immune response to vaccination in children. In addition, previous studies mainly focus on the immunotoxicity of traditional PFASs, and our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the effects of PFASs on immune system is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the immunotoxicity of new PFASs and associated mechanism. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","acetic acid; alcohol derivative; carboxylic acid; fluorotelomer alcohol; inorganic compound; microplastic; nanoplastic; organofluorine derivative; organophosphate; perfluoro compound; phosphinic acid derivative; phosphonic acid derivative; polymer; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; plastic; biodegradation; chemical substance; desorption; health risk; mortality risk; plastic; risk; risk factor; adsorption; aquatic environment; biodegradation; butter; cereal; classification; dangerous goods; desorption; ecosystem restoration; ecotoxicology; environmental factor; fluorination; food; food packaging; health hazard; hydrophobicity; information retrieval; microplastic pollution; milk; nonhuman; pollution transport; Review; ScienceDirect; search engine; static electricity; Web of Science; ecosystem; human; water pollutant; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Microplastics; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

This highlights the need for understanding the impact of such application on the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in poultry gut and devising means to circumvent the potential resistome expansion. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are potential natural alternative to antibiotic to improve animal health and performance, supposedly via positively affecting the gut microbial ecosystem, but there is little systematic information available. In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups. In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of phytogenic feed additives could be an alternative to antibiotics in poultry farming, with the added benefit of counteracting antimicrobial resistance development.

Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions.

The dependence of the parasite on the host hemoglobin could lead to increased disease severity in the host. In this study, molecular docking analyses were used to evaluate the binding interactions of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide analogues to P. falciparum falcilysin. The protein databank and the CheBI database were used to find P. falciparum falcilysin and the compounds, respectively. The protein and the collected compounds were imported into PyRx virtual screening software and the docking was initiated. Following that, Discovery Studio was utilized to virtualize the 2D and 3D interactions. The binding energies of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonate and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonic acid were both more than-10.0 kcal/mol among the phenanthroline analogues while only oleanolic acid and N-ethylsuccinimide-mycothiol conjugate from the dipicolinic acid and N-ethylmaleimide analogues had binding energies of-9.7 and-9.4 kcal/mol respectively. The higher binding energies were attributable to hydrogen bond interactions as well as other interactions between the chemicals and the amino acid residues of the falcilysin. The analogues were shown to be moderately safe in pharmacokinetic investigations and scaled Lipinski's rule of five (RO5). The findings of the study revealed that analogues of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide could serve as potential inhibitors of P. falciparum falcilysin.

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

In VRFB, polymer membranes play a significant role in transporting protons for current transmission and act as barriers between positive and negative electrodes/electrolytes. Commercial polymer membranes (such as Nafion) are the widely used IEM in VRFBs due to their outstanding chemical stability and proton conductivity. However, the membrane cost and increased vanadium ions permeability limit its commercial application. Therefore, various modified perfluorinated and non-perfluorinated membranes have been developed. This comprehensive review primarily focuses on recent developments of hybrid polymer composite membranes with inorganic TiO2 nanofillers for VRFB applications. Hence, various fabrications are performed in the membrane with TiO2 to alter their physicochemical properties for attaining perfect IEM. Additionally, embedding the-SO3H groups by sulfonation on the nanofiller surface enhances membrane proton conductivity and mechanical strength. Incorporating TiO2 and modified TiO2 (sTiO2, and organic silica modified TiO2) into Nafion and other non-perfluorinated membranes (sPEEK and sPI) has effectively influenced the polymer membrane properties for better VRFB performances.

This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement. © 2022 by the authors.

DATA EXTRACTION Baseline metabolites per-SD risk estimates and 95% CIs for incident type 2 diabetes were extracted from all eligible studies. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 61 reports with 71,196 participants and 11,771 type 2 diabetes cases/ events were included in the updated review. Meta-analysis was performed for 412 metabolites, of which 123 were statistically significantly associated (false dis-covery rate–corrected P &lt; 0.05) with type 2 diabetes risk. Higher plasma and serum levels of certain amino acids (branched-chain, aromatic, alanine, gluta-mate, lysine, and methionine), carbohydrates and energy-related metabolites (mannose, trehalose, and pyruvate), acylcarnitines (C4-DC, C4-OH, C5, C5-OH, and C8:1), the majority of glycerolipids (di-and triacylglycerols), (lyso)phosphati-dylethanolamines, and ceramides included in meta-analysis were associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 1.07–2.58). Higher levels of gly-cine, glutamine, betaine, indolepropionate, and (lyso)phosphatidylcholines were associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk (hazard ratio 0.69–0.90). LIMITATIONS Substantial heterogeneity (I2 &gt; 50%, s2 &gt; 0.1) was observed for some of the metabolites. CONCLUSIONS Several plasma and serum metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and carbohy-drates, are associated with type 2 diabetes risk. © 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.","acylcarnitine; alanine; aromatic amino acid; betaine; branched chain amino acid; carbohydrate; ceramide; diacylglycerol; fatty acid; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycerolipid; glycine; lysine; mannose; methionine; phosphatidylethanolamine; pyruvic acid; sphingolipid; trehalose; triacylglycerol; amino acid; carbohydrate; amino acid blood level; amino acid urine level; Article; carbohydrate metabolism; diabetes risk score; disease association; energy metabolism; false discovery rate; hazard ratio; high throughput technology; human; metabolite; metabolome; metabolomics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; plasma; risk factor; serum; systematic review; meta analysis; metabolomics; observational study; procedures; prospective study; risk factor; Amino Acids; Carbohydrates; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Metabolomics; Observational Studies as Topic; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"

There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022","Dust; Potable water; Risk perception; Exposure pathways; House dust; Human exposures; Indoor air; Indoor exposure; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Residential environment; Serum concentration; Systematic Review; Consumer products; cosmetic; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); dust; indoor air; organohalogen; pollution exposure; ambient air; Article; artificial intelligence; blood sampling; Caucasian; cleaning; concentration (parameter); consumer; environmental exposure; evidence based practice; house dust; household; human; indoor environment; inhalation; machine learning; population structure; risk factor; sex difference; social participation; social status; systematic review; biological monitoring; chemistry; culture medium; dust; female; pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Monitoring; Culture Media; Drinking Water; Dust; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans"

Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), non-pregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems. Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors. © 2022","Amino acids; Biomolecules; Cytology; Fatty acids; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physiology; Search engines; Urea; Epidemiological studies; Exposome; Human study; Metabolic pathways; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Non-targeted; Perfluorinated compounds; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Scoping review; Metabolism; carnitine; fatty acid; glycerophospholipid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; purine; pyrimidine; tricarboxylic acid; tryptophan; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; epidemiology; fatty acid; lipid; metabolism; metabolite; oxidation; persistent organic pollutant; physiology; adolescent; adult; aged; amino acid metabolism; biomembrane; blood analysis; cell energy; citric acid cycle; comparative study; energy resource; environmental exposure; epidemiology; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; lipid metabolism; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic regulation; metabolomics; middle aged; pregnant woman; publication; purine metabolism; pyrimidine metabolism; Review; sample size; urea cycle; urinalysis; child; metabolomics; pollutant; pregnancy; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies"

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021","alkyl group; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkanoic acid; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; thyroid hormone; chemical substance; health impact; literature review; pollution exposure; public health; statistical analysis; adolescent; adult; aged; Bayes theorem; child; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled study; environmental exposure; Europe; female; fetus development; health hazard; homeostasis; hormone metabolism; human; immunotoxicity; k means clustering; least square analysis; male; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; North America; outcome assessment; population exposure; Review; risk assessment; structural equation modeling; systematic review; thyroid gland; pollutant; toxicity; Europe; North America; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Bayes Theorem; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Europe; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Thyroid Hormones"

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce. Future neuroprotection studies should report standardized functional outcome measures and combine neuroprotective agents with reperfusion therapies in AIS or aim to include prespecified subgroup analyses for treatment with IVT and/or EVT.

The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-μM HFPO-TA- and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-μM HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-μM PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport.

Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Alkalinity; Hydrophobicity; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Pore size; Surface chemistry; Adsorption performance; Adverse effect; Aliphatic compound; Health and environment; Human environment; Human health; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Activated carbon; charcoal; fluorocarbon; metal organic framework; adsorption; human; water pollutant; Adsorption; Charcoal; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The research efforts attempt to develop synthetic (chemicals) and natural (biological) adsorbents for remediation of hazardous heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins, antibiotics, and other emerging pollutants. However, application of potential adsorbents in remediation lack selectivity and sustainability prospects. Present review aims to provide a critical discussion on adsorption potential of synthetic and natural adsorbents in sustainability framework. The synthetic adsorbents are discussed in terms of recipes and underlying sorption mechanisms. Herein, pragmatic analysis on novel synthetic adsorbents like ferrate, following green chemistry principles and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) is elucidated. In natural biosorbents (both live and dead biomass), the phyto-technologies, biosorption, natural/engineered biochar, clay, and chitosan are comprehensively reviewed. This panoramic review revealed that phytoremediation and biosorption can be preferred as ‘sustainable bioresource eco-technologies’ for remediation of chemical pollution. The interrelationship between adsorbents and United Nations- Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) is established. Eco-friendly and cost-effective biosorbents tend to follow the sustainability paradigm unlike traditional chemical adsorbents. In conclusion, the ‘biorefinery’, ‘Water-Energy-Food Nexus’ and ‘biocircular economy’ co-benefits of biosorbents can augment the sustainability indicators to help achieve salient SDGs. © 2022 The Author",

Modification of maternal metabolism by environmental exposure may be an important pathway for these impacts. However, there is limited evidence regarding exposure to a wide array of chemicals and the metabolome during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between the urinary exposome and metabolome during pregnancy. METHODS: Urine samples were collected in the first and third trimesters from 1,024 pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in Jiangsu Province, China. The exposome was analyzed using the first trimester sample with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The metabolome was analyzed using the third trimester sample with UHPLC-HRMS. We evaluated associations between each of 106 exposures in the first trimester with 139 metabolites in the third trimester. RESULTS: We identified 1,245 significant associations (p &lt; 3:39 × 10−6, Bonferroni correction) between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Among elements, the largest number of the significant metabolic associations were observed for magnesium, and among organic compounds, for 4-tert-octylphenol. We used exposome–metabolome associations to explore mechanisms underlying published associations between prenatal chemical exposures and offspring health outcomes. This integration of the literature with our results suggests that reported associations between 10 analytes and birth weight, gestational age, fat deposition, neurobehavioral development, immunological disorders, and hypertension may be partially mediated by metabolites associated with these exposures. DISCUSSION: This high-dimensional analysis of the urinary exposome and metabolome identified many associations between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Integration of these associations with the literature on health outcomes of exposure suggests that environmental modulation of the maternal metabolome may play a role in the association between prenatal exposure on pregnancy and child health outcomes. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD. © 2022 by the authors.

Valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), which due to its epigenetic focus needs to be studied in depth to understand the effects it might elicit in BC cells. The aim of this work is to contribute to exploring the complete pharmacological mechanism of VPA in killing cancer cells using MCF-7. LC-MS/MS metabolomics studies were applied to MCF-7 treated with VPA. The results show that VPA promote cell death by altering metabolic pathways principally pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and 2′ deoxy-α-D-ribose-1-phosphate degradation related with metabolites that decrease cell proliferation and cell growth, interfere with energy sources and enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We even suggest that mechanisms such as ferropoptosis could be involved due to deregulation of L-cysteine. These results suggest that VPA has different pharmacological mechanisms in killing cancer cells including apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms, and due to the broad impact that HDACis have in cells, metabolomic approaches are a great source of information to generate new insights for this type of molecule. © 2022 by the authors.

In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science. © 2022 American Chemical Society","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Environmental technology; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Accurate removal; Advanced treatment; Complex water matrix; Emerging pollutants; Interferents; Research frameworks; Selective mechanism; Target pollutants; Toxic organic pollutant; Water matrices; Organic pollutants; organic pollutant; organizational framework; toxic substance; acid base balance; chemical bond; electron transport; environmental science; molecular recognition; quantitative analysis; Review; static electricity; surface property; waste component removal; waste water management; water pollutant; adsorption; pollutant; wastewater; water management; water; Adsorption; Environmental Pollutants; Waste Water; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3–4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures. © 2021","alkyl group; fluorocarbon; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer stem cell; cardiac stem cell; cell culture; cell fate; cell proliferation; controlled study; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; glycolysis; human; human cell; lipid metabolism; male; mass fragmentography; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; principal component analysis; prostate cancer; prostate cell; protein expression; RNA sequence; single cell RNA seq; stem cell self-renewal; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; virus culture; animal; drug effect; drug screening; nude mouse; pathology; pollutant; procedures; prostate; stem cell; toxicity; young adult; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Prostate; Stem Cells; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Young Adult"

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health.

As a consequence, the national authorities and scientists are paying more attention to the development and implementation of viable cost-effective detoxification solutions. Biochar has emerged as a biomass-derived material that can be produced through a variety of feedstocks and carbonization techniques. Distinct characteristics of biochar can be appropriate, cost-effective, and eco-friendly for removing a wide spectrum of inorganic and organic pollutants. This review aims to emphasize the crucial function of biochar-based materials in the abatement of toxic emerging pollutants. It covers the synthesis and applications of engineered biochars by discussing extensive research and knowledge in this area. The relationships of biochar properties with feedstock, synthesis conditions, technologies and modification methods have also been discussed. Biochars with different surface functionalities (e.g., COO−, Fe-O, etc.,) can be obtained by either varying the feedstock material (lignocellulosic or non-lignocellulosic) or by modifying it with different chemicals (e.g., metal ions, rare earth elements, surfactants) including the preparation of composites. The interaction mechanisms between biochar and various pollutants are reviewed and analyzed. The type of interactions (e.g., electrostatic, π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding) depends on the different surface functionalities of biochar. This review also illustrates that biochar and its related composites have shown remarkable properties and versatility for their effective application in adsorption, photocatalysis and oxidation processes in aqueous phase. Finally, prospective research directions and opportunity areas for biochar research are also discussed.

Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants.

This review comprehensively presents the up-to-date developments of media used in both aerobic and anaerobic AGMBRs for treating wastewaters containing conventional and emerging pollutants. It also elaborates the properties of different media, characteristics of attached biomass, and their contributions to AGMBR performance. Conventional media, such as biological activated carbon and polymeric carriers, induce formation of aerobic, anoxic and/or anaerobic microenvironment, increase specific surface area or porous space for biomass retention, improve microbial activities, and enrich diverse microorganisms, thereby enhancing pollutants removal. Meanwhile, new media (i.e. biochar, bioaugmented carriers with selected strain/mixed cultures) do not only eliminate conventional pollutants (i.e. high concentration of nitrogen, etc.), but also effectively remove emerging pollutants (i.e. micropollutants, nonylphenol, adsorbable organic halogens, etc.) by forming thick and dense biofilm, creating anoxic/anaerobic microenvironments inside the media, enriching special functional microorganisms and increasing activity of microorganisms. Additionally, media can improve sludge characteristics (i.e. less extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products, larger floc size, better sludge settleability, etc.), alleviating membrane fouling. Future studies need to focus on the development and applications of more new functional media in removing wider spectrum of emerging pollutants and enhancing biogas generation, as well as scale-up of lab-scale AGMBRs to pilot or full-scale AGMBRs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microorganisms; Pollution; Reclamation; Anaerobics; Attached growth; Carrier; Emerging pollutants; Growth process; Medium; Membrane bioreactor system; Microenvironments; Nutrient pollutants; Property; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; biogas; polymer; bioreactor; fouling; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic bacterium; biofouling; biomass; concentration (parameter); nonhuman; particle size; physical chemistry; physical parameters; quorum quenching; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; artificial membrane; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; water management; Bioreactors; Membranes, Artificial; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Purification"

Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cells; Fatty acids; Health risks; Metabolites; Molecular biology; Proteins; Fatty acid metabolism; Leydig cells; Low dose; Low-dose exposures; Metabolomics; Molecular mechanism; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Reproductive toxicities; Steroidogenic stimulation; Metabolism; fluorocarbon; hormone; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; steroid; animal; human; Leydig cell; male; metabolomics; proteomics; Animals; Caprylates; Fluorocarbons; Hormones; Humans; Leydig Cells; Male; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Steroids"

However, using conventional biological matrices such as urine, blood, or dissected skin to detect BPS/BPA in the human body system requires longer exposure time to them, hardly defines the pollutant source of the accumulated BPS/BPA, and is often invasive. Herein, our new approach i.e. fingerprint analysis quantitatively confirms the transfer of BPS/BPA from receipts (specific pollution source) to human skin only within receipt-handling of “20 s”. When receipts (fingertip region size; ~1 cm2) containing 100–300 μg of BPS or BPA are handled, 20–40 μg fingerprint-1 of BPS or BPA is transferred to human skin (fingertip). This transferred amount of BPS/BPA can still be toxic according to the toxicity test using water fleas. As a visual evidence, a fingerprint map that matches the distribution of the absorbed BPS/BPA is developed using a mass spectrometry imaging tool. This is the first study to analyze fingerprints to determine the incorporation mechanism of emerging pollutants.

Postoperative anemia after fracture tends to cause ischemia, hypoxia in cells, tissues and organs, increasing the rate of blood transfusion, risk of infection, disability and mortality. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in the treatment of anemia for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis.Methods:This study is a prospective, outcome assessor-, and data analyst-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The objective of this proposed study was to investigate whether Shengyu Decoction could improve the symptoms of anemia after proximal femoral nail antirotation in elderly ITF patients. After qualifying for screening, patients will be randomized into 2 groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Hemoglobin concentration, HBL, and HHS score are outcome measurements. The other outcomes also included time to get out of bed, discharge to home, 30-day readmission rates, and mortality.Discussion:ITF is commonly occurring in senior citizens, and those who are senior in age generally suffer 1 or more basic diseases, whose nutritional status is already poor. Trauma and surgical stimulation not only aggravate the existing disease or induce corresponding cardiovascular complications, but also worsen the nutritional status, which can easily cause postoperative anemia in patients. Because of the limited clinical modalities available for the treatment of postoperative anemia after fracture surgery, and most of them have various side effects that are not easily tolerated by the elderly. Therefore, from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, we proposed a protocol using mild Chinese herbal decoction to treat postoperative anemia in ITF.Registration number: OSF Registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/JQ6ZF. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.

The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplas-mic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the sem-iniferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations. © 2022 by the authors.

Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

Due to the contamination of water resources with antibiotic residues, and the concern to contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, scientists have tapped into agricultural and industrial wastes in order to transform them into new functional adsorbents that allow the adsorption of these pollutants. This review aims to summarize the different types of adsorptive materials that can be prepared using these residues and their application for removing antibiotics. From the reviewed literature, the adsorbents were classified as raw materials, surface-modified adsorbents, waste-based composites, carbon-based materials, and other adsorbents like zeolite, nano-hydroxyapatite, nano-cellulase, nano-silica, among others. Biochar and hydrochar are two of the most studied carbonaceous materials, with adsorption capacities ranging from 10 to 944 mg/g. Other leading adsorbents from the same family include mesoporous carbons, hierarchical and heteroatoms-doped porous carbons, and bio graphene, with surface area and adsorption performance over 1000 m2/g and 500 mg/g, respectively. The most outstanding material prepared from waste was zeolite analcime, produced from electrolytic manganese residue, removing 1922 mg/g for roxithromycin. In addition, new methodologies or combined methods to produce these adsorbents, including new modifier agents (ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents), templating, self-templating, doping techniques, and thermo-chemical approaches were reviewed for the first time. Furthermore, particular emphasis was given to photocatalyst-loaded adsorbents due to their synergistic effect of adsorption and degradation of antibiotics. Finally, novel methodologies to regenerate saturated adsorbents were discussed, such as UV radiation-assisted regeneration and ultrasound. © 2021","Adsorbents; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Antibiotics; Hydroxyapatite; Ionic liquids; Mesoporous materials; Nanocomposites; Silica; Water pollution; Water quality; Zeolites; Adsorptive materials; Antibacterial removal; Antibacterials; Antibiotic removal; Biosorbents; Emerging pollutants; Material science; Novel materials; Residue; Waters resources; Adsorption"

Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

Microvascular decompression (MVD) with internal neurolysis (IN) is an alternative treatment that might benefit patients but has limited understanding. We performed a systematic review of IN for the treatment of TN. Methods: Studies from 2000 to 2021 that had assessed IN for TN were aggregated and independently reviewed. Results: A total of 520 patients in 12 studies were identified, with 384 who had undergone IN (mean age, 53.8 years; range, 46–61.4 years; mean follow-up, 36.5 months). Preoperative symptoms had been present for ∼55.0 months before treatment, and pain was predominantly in V2 and V3 (26.8%), followed by other distributions. Of the patients, 83.7% (range, 72%–93.8%) had had an excellent to good outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score [BNI-PS], I–II). The pain outcomes at 1 year were excellent for 58%–78.4%, good or better for 77%–93.75%, and fair or better for 80%–93.75% of the patients. On average, facial numbness after IN was experienced by 96% of the patients. However, at follow-up, facial numbness remained in only 1.75%–10%. Most of the remaining numbness was not significantly distressing to the patients. Subgroup comparisons of IN versus recurrent MVD, IN versus radiofrequency ablation, the effects of IN in the absence of vascular compression, and IN with and without MVD were also evaluated. Conclusions: IN represents a promising surgical intervention for TN in the absence of vascular compression and for potential cases of recurrence. Complications were limited in general but require further study. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","analgesic agent; adult; alternative medicine; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; controlled study; cornea ulcer; facial nerve disease; female; follow up; fractional anisotropy; human; hypesthesia; internal neurolysis; liquorrhea; male; meningitis; microvascular decompression; middle aged; nerve surgery; numeric rating scale; paresthesia; postoperative analgesia; postoperative pain; quality of life; recurrence risk; recurrent disease; reoperation; stereotactic radiosurgery; systematic review; thermocoagulation; trigeminus neuralgia; adverse event; hypesthesia; microvascular decompression; neurosurgery; pain; retrospective study; treatment outcome; trigeminus neuralgia; Humans; Hypesthesia; Microvascular Decompression Surgery; Middle Aged; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pain; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Trigeminal Neuralgia"

The present work comprehensively reviews the source, composition, and environmental implications of shellfish wastes and aquaculture wastewater. Moreover, recent advancements in the valorization of shellfish wastes into value-added biochar via emerging thermochemical and modification techniques are scrutinized. The utilization of the produced biochar in removing emerging pollutants from aquaculture wastewater is also discussed. It was revealed that shellfish waste-derived biochar exhibits relatively higher adsorption capacities (300–1500 mg/g) compared to lignocellulose biochar (<200 mg/g). The shellfish waste-derived biochar can be effectively employed for the removal of various contaminants such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and excessive nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Finally, future research priorities and challenges faced to improve the sustainability of the shellfish aquaculture industry to effectively support global food security are elaborated. This review envisages that future studies should focus on the biorefinery concept to extract more useful compounds (e.g., carotenoid, chitin) from shellfish wastes for promoting environmental-friendly aquaculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Effluents; Food supply; Health risks; Heavy metals; Shellfish; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Aquaculture wastewater; Biochar; Engineered biochar; Global production; Growing markets; ITS applications; Market demand; Shellfish aquaculture; Shellfish waste; State-of-the art reviews; Aquaculture; adsorbent; ammonia; antibiotic agent; charcoal; heavy metal; lignocellulose; nitrate; nitrite; phosphorus; biochar; charcoal; aquaculture industry; biochar; detection method; food security; shellfish; sustainability; valorization; wastewater; wastewater treatment; adsorption; aquaculture; Article; ball milling; bioaccumulation; bioengineering; carbonization; chemical composition; chemical modification; coating (procedure); environmental impact; food security; hydrothermal carbonization; nonhuman; oxidation; pyrolysis; shellfish; shellfish farming; suspended particulate matter; waste valorization; waste water management; water pollutant; water supply; aquaculture; ecosystem; human; shellfish; water management; Aquaculture; Charcoal; Ecosystem; Humans; Shellfish; Water Purification"

In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be robust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cell culture; Cells; Metabolism; Metabolites; 3d cell spheroid; Amino-acids; Cell model; Cell spheroids; Hepatotoxicity; Living systems; Metabolomic analysis; Metabolomics; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Toxic contaminants; Amino acids; glutamine; perfluorooctanoic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; amino acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; amino acid; cell; metabolism; metabolite; polymer; reactive oxygen species; remediation; toxicity; adverse outcome; amino acid metabolism; Article; cell death; cell survival rate; chronic toxicity; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cytotoxicity test; environmental exposure; human; human cell; liver cell; liver toxicity; long term exposure; metabolomics; short term exposure; signal transduction; three dimensional cell culture; cell culture technique; metabolomics; toxic hepatitis; Amino Acids; Caprylates; Cell Culture Techniques; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolomics"

Established techniques such as photocatalysis and membrane technology have proven to be promising in removing various persistent organic pollutants (POP) from wastewaters. The emergence of hybrid photocatalytic membrane which incorporates both photocatalysis and membrane technology has shown greater potential in treating POP laden wastewater based on their synergistic effects. This article provides an in-depth review on the roles of both photocatalysis and membrane technology in hybrid photocatalytic membranes for the treatment of POP containing wastewaters. A concise introduction on POP’s in terms of examples, their origins and their effect on a multitude of organisms are critically reviewed. The fundamentals of photocatalytic mechanism, current directions in photocatalyst design and their employment to treat POP’s are also discussed.

Sarcopenia overlaps with the physical domain of frailty, and most existing studies have analyzed the associated factors of frailty and sarcopenia as an isolated state. Perturbations in metabolism may play an important role in the presence of frailty or sarcopenia; however, the metabolites associated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines, as specific panels, are significantly correlated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia, to gain insight into potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms and to facilitate their management. Methods: We applied a targeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach in serum samples from 246 Chinese older men (age 79.2 ± 7.8 years) with frailty (n = 150), non-frailty (n = 96), frailty and sarcopenia (n = 52), non-frail and non-sarcopenic control (n = 85). Frailty was evaluated using Freid phenotype criteria, sarcopenia was defined by diagnostic algorithm of Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the participants were diagnosed as frailty and sarcopenia when they met the evaluation criteria of both frailty and sarcopenia. A panel of 29 metabolomic profiles was assayed and included different classes of amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to screen the metabolic factors contributing to frailty status, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore important factors and distinguish different groups. Results: In older men demonstrating the frail phenotype, amino acid perturbations included lower tryptophan and higher glycine levels. With regard to lipid metabolism, the frailty phenotype was characterized by lower concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine (C5), LPC16:0 and LPC18:2, while higher levels of octanoyl-L-carnitine (C8), decanoyl-L-carnitine (C10), dodecanoyl-L-carnitine (C12) and tetradecanoyl-L-carnitine (C14). After adjusting for several clinical confounders, tryptophan, LPC18:2, LPC 16:0 and C5 were negatively correlated with frailty, and C8 and C12 were positively related to frailty. We preliminarily identified metabolic profiles (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, glycine and tryptophan) that may distinguish older men with frailty from those without frailty. Importantly, a set of serum amino acids and LPCs (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, and tryptophan) was characterized in the metabotype of older adults with an overlap of frailty and sarcopenia. The metabolites that were most discriminating of frailty status implied that the underlying mechanism might be involved in antioxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: These present metabolic analyses may provide valuable information on the potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms of frailty, and overlapping sarcopenia. The findings obtained may offer insight into their management in older adults.

Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society","Aquifers; Bacteria; Dechlorination; Metabolism; Metabolites; Anaerobic microbial community; Anaerobics; Biotransformation; Co metabolisms; Microbial communities; Microbial composition; Organohalides; Reductive dechlorination; Relative abundance; Sulphonates; Ethers; organohalogen derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; RNA 16S; trichloroethylene; ether; ether derivative; anoxic conditions; antimicrobial activity; bacterium; chemical reaction; metabolism; microbial activity; microbial community; salt; wastewater; wastewater treatment; anaerobic metabolism; anaerobic sludge; Article; bioaccumulation; biosafety; biosolid; biotransformation; chlorination; controlled study; dechlorination; Dehalobacter; Dehalococcoides; DNA extraction; Geobacter; hydrophobicity; microbial community; microbial degradation; nonhuman; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; bioremediation; Chloroflexi; metabolism; Anaerobiosis; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chloroflexi; Ether; Ethers"

A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low-quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very-low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3. CFOs versus PFOs (1 trial, 108 participants): low-quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 28 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD -1.5, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.22). Low-quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index - FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD -18.55, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68), child-rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 25.8) and parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI -4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD -1.33 seconds, 95% CI -2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 25 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.98). Low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI-disability MD -4.17, 95% CI -24.4 to 16.06), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -3.84, 95% CI -19 to 11.33), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -0.64, 95% CI -13.22 to 11.94). 3. CFOs versus PFsO (2 trials, 87 participants): low-quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD -1.48, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI-disability MD -7.28, 95% CI -15.47 to 0.92), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI -3.9 to 21.2), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI -11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions: Low to very low-certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high-cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re-directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This review critically examines the strategies to generate highly reactive high-valent iron intermediates, FeVO43– (FeV) and FeIVO44– or FeIVO32– (FeIV) species, from FeVIO42–, for the treatment of polluted water with greater efficiency. Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–. Further mechanistic elucidation of activated ferrate systems is vital to achieve high efficiency in oxidizing emerging pollutants in various aqueous streams. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Ammonia; Density functional theory; Efficiency; Health risks; Metal ions; Metals; Oxidation; Reaction intermediates; Silica; Water treatment; Environmental fields; Ferrate; High-valent iron intermediate; High-valent irons; Inorganics; ITS applications; Oxidation state; Polluted water; Reductants; Single electron transfer; Iron compounds; ammonia; carbonic acid; creatinine; endocrine disruptor; ferric ion; iron; metal ion; phenol derivative; phosphoprotein phosphatase; silicon dioxide; sulfadiazine; sulfonamide; trimethylamine; water; ferrate ion; iron; water; aqueous solution; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); drug; oxidation; salt; urine; water treatment; aqueous solution; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; chlorination; comparative study; controlled study; density functional theory; drug hydroxylation; electron transport; Escherichia coli; ionic strength; kinetic parameters; oxidation; oxidation kinetics; pulse radiolysis; rate constant; reaction time; Review; static electricity; stoichiometry; water pollution; water treatment; oxidation reduction reaction; water management; water pollutant; Ferric Compounds; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Aquatic organisms; Disinfection; Efficiency; Health risks; Industrial chemicals; Organic chemicals; Pesticides; Risk management; Water pollution; Aquatic environments; Average risk; Chemical pollution; Micropollutants; Pharmaceutical and personal care products; Prioritization; Risk quotients; Risks assessments; Water environments; Weighted averages; Risk assessment; drug; pesticide; plastic; water; environmental monitoring; human; toxicity; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pesticides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Plastics; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows that 1H-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased manner.

Their resistance to degradation, however, means that PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate. PFAS exposure has also been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS production. Methods: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results: Our analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent. Conclusions: Results highlight a need for additional research on occupational PFAS exposures and concomitant environmental exposures in these populations. Research on exposure levels in occupations and industries known or suspected to utilize PFAS is critically needed to foster informed recommendations for exposure mitigation measures to protect workers from adverse health effects of PFAS exposure. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. Design: The GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. Results: Our search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. Conclusions: Recognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Current conventional drinking and wastewater treatment approaches fail to effectively remove these substances from aqueous media, motivating researchers to focus on using sorption, a simple and cost-effective method, to remove PFAS from contaminated water. This work aims to summarize and critically evaluate the sorption capacities of PFAS by a variety of natural and engineered sorbents, including carbonaceous materials, ion exchange resins, polymers, different natural materials and other engineered sorbent materials. The specific focus of this review is on the performance of these different materials in removing short-chain PFAS due to their high solubility and mobility in aqueous media.

This paper aims to review the relationship between EDCs and breast, prostate, testicle, ovary, and thyroid cancer, discussing carcinogenic activity of known EDCs, while evaluating the impact on public health. Methods: A literature review regarding EDCs and cancer was carried out with particular interest on meta-analysis and human studies. Results: The definition of EDCs has been changed through years, and currently there are no common criteria to test new chemicals to clarify their possible carcinogenic activity. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption. Conclusion: EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer. New evidence supports the role of other EDCs as possible carcinogenic and pregnant women should avoid risk area and exposure. The relationship between EDCs and cancer supports the need for effective prevention policies increasing public awareness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).",

However, the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L), one of such PFAs on the internal egg quality indices of laying hens is less clear. As a result, this meta-analysis investigated the impact of garlic supplementation on egg yolk weight (EYW) and egg yolk cholesterol (EYC) content in laying hens. A search carried out in three online databases yielded five hundred and ten studies of which fifteen passed the predefined selection conditions for the meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were information on moderator variables (hen’s age, layer strains, presentation form, treatment duration, inclusion level, and the number of hens used for the study), and outcome measures (EYW and EYC) with their corresponding measures of variance. All analyses were performed in OpenMEE software. Results indicate that addition of garlic to layer diets increased EYW by 0.063 g [95% confidence interval (CI) = 95% CI: -0.051, 0.176] compared to zero, though the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, garlic supplementation reduced EYC concentrations by 0.641 mg/g yolk (95% CI: -0.059, -0.424) in comparison with controls, taking publication bias and heterogeneity into consideration. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that modifiers had impact on the results and conclusion.

Regarding the complications of PFAs, few studies have investigated periprosthetic fractures. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight a previously overlooked complication of primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint. Methods: Three literature databases were searched for studies published between 2000 to 2020 using relevant keywords. A total of 4,942 articles were originally identified. After excluding duplicates and analysing the titles and abstracts, 20 studies were considered. From these, data regarding the number of cases, clinical outcomes and complications were extracted. Results: Among the 20 selected articles, only one described periprosthetic fractures as a complication of PFAs. Herein, we also report an illustrative case of an unknown fracture complication. No cases in the literature were found that described the type of complications experienced by our patient during the postoperative period. Conclusions: This review confirms the lack of data about clinical outcomes and fracture complications of PFAs. In primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint, patient selection and close consideration of demographic factors (such as BMI and age) and intraoperative factors (such as patellar thickness and size of the trochlear component) play a key role in optimising pre-operative planning to avoid intraoperative periprosthetic fractures. © The Author(s) 2022.","arthrodesis; arthroplasty; arthroscopy; body mass; bone metabolism; bone radiography; cartilage injury; follow up; fracture healing; fracture nonunion; hip arthroplasty; human; knee function; knee pain; operation duration; osteoarthritis; osteosynthesis; patella fracture; patellofemoral joint; periprosthetic fracture; postoperative pain; postoperative period; Review; risk factor; systematic review; thickness; total knee arthroplasty; wound infection"

Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants—both individually and in combination—such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced native distributions are suitable study species to provide information for the conservation of freshwater environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

Insulin infusion sets interface with the skin surface, the dermis, and the subcutaneous space and may be the cause of infusion failure due to biological events or mechanical problems. Novel IISs with extended wear time and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these issues are described in the literature although material-tissue interactions are poorly understood. This rapid review focuses on the impact of IIS materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with diabetes and includes literature identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Twenty-one studies were identified for qualitative synthesis that encompassed a limited and heterogenic body of evidence including 10 clinical reports, six reviews, one case report, two abstracts, and two communications. Two clinical reports were randomized crossover studies. Reports on materials mostly compared steel versus polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cannulas and suggested no substantial difference in tissue response to these materials. Reports on designs focused mostly on the angle of cannula insertion. To drive and improve research on extended wear and nonimmunogenic IISs, future studies should focus on material-tissue interaction as dedicated outcome measures, quantified with punch biopsy and imaging techniques such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and confocal reflectance microscopy.

The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs’ potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m–2 d–1 or 0 to 1583 n m–3. The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs’ shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What’s noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs’ transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs’ environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts. It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The country is very vulnerable to NTDs due to its favourable tropical climate and multiple risk factors. However, the distribution of the diseases and the populations at risk for the various NTDs is unknown. This paper describes the distribution of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 58 counties of South Sudan. Methods: a descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study of LF in 58 counties in 8 states of South Sudan recruited adult volunteers aged ≥ 15 years tested for circulating filarial antigens (CFA). A quantitative descriptive statistical was performed to determine the prevalence rates and the endemicity (CFA positivity rate ≥1%) of lymphatic filariasis in 9213 adult individuals from 101 villages. Results: the overall prevalence of positive CFA was 1.6%, and the highest state prevalence was reported in the Upper Nile state at 3.4%. Based on the prevalence of positive CFA 64% of the surveyed counties are endemic to lymphatic filariasis. The endemicity ranged from 1-11.1% positive CFA. The highest prevalence of positive CAF was observed in the >50 years old age group (2.7%), followed by the 46-50 age group (2.3%). Males tested more positive than females (52.4% Vs 47.6%). Participants were three times more likely to test positive for CFA on filarial test strips (FTS) compared to immunochromatographic test (ICT). There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of positive CFA among the two tests (P=.002). Conclusion: the distribution of LF is widespread, with varying transmission risks. The produced prevalence maps of infection provided evidence on the areas for targeted interventions in the national NTD program in South Sudan. An increased number of positive CFA were identified using FTS than ICT; hence, it is advisable to use FTS in the future transmission survey. © Mutale Nsakashalo Senkwe et al.","parasite antigen; adult; animal; cross-sectional study; female; human; lymphatic filariasis; male; middle aged; prevalence; South Sudan; Wuchereria bancrofti; Adult; Animals; Antigens, Helminth; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; South Sudan; Wuchereria bancrofti"

Most of these compounds have been detected in significant amounts in different water matrices (drinking, sewage, ground water). Several conventional and advanced oxidation processes have been used for the removal of ECs. However, these processes are limited by incomplete degradation and high energy input, and some technologies such as adsorption and membrane processes involve only phase transfer of pollutants. According to the USEPA, ECs in the range from ng L−1 to mg L−1 can impose adverse environmental and health effects. This review details the application of nonthermal plasma (NTP) produced by pulsed electrical discharge which has been widely investigated for the abatement of various emerging contaminants in water and wastewater. Since NTP may not be economically suitable as a stand-alone unit for wastewater because of energy costs and the formation of reaction byproducts this review will focus on the integration of NTP in water treatment schemes. In general, single unit water treatment techniques are inadequate for the removal of these recalcitrant compounds. Treatment technologies that combine various advanced oxidation/reduction processes such as NTP with other conventional methods such as biological treatment may have potential for the complete removal of such pollutants. Pre-treatment and post-treatment NTP units can be added based on economic viability and treatment effectiveness. Integrated technologies for removal of ECs from water are critically examined in this review. © 2022, Institute of Electrostatics. All rights reserved.",

Food allergies have a prevalence of 6-8% in children and 2-3% in adults, which is increasing in the last 10 years due to industrialization. The wide variety of ingredients containing food allergens, in combination with the high number of product formulations and processing methods to produce food makes allergen detection a challenge. It is important to highlight that even trace amounts of allergens are able to elicit allergic reactions and the commercialization of food products with a potential health risk is forbidden (European Union Regulation (EU) 178/2002). Hence, precautionary allergen labeling must be provided in the different food products. In addition, this creates a real need for the development of highly sensitive and reliable techniques that allow the detection and quantification of multiple allergens present in trace amounts. This, together with the possibility to perform new allergen discovery studies (shotgun proteomics), makes Proteomic approaches a widely used methodology in this field. In this chapter we summarize the current knowledge regarding food allergies and the proteomic studies performed for the analysis of the different allergens. We briefly describe immunological processes underlying the different types of food allergies, the causative allergens involved in these processes, as well as the different proteomic approaches developed to identify (e.g., LC-MS/MS) and quantify (e.g., targeted proteomics such as selected/multiple reaction monitoring, SRM/MSM) these allergens in different conditions (e.g., complex mixtures, ultra-processed food, etc). Moreover, we have performed a comprehensive review of the different allergens and proteomic studies carried out in the field of plant food allergies, including gluten related disorders (GRDs), pollen-fruit allergy syndrome (PFAS), legumes allergy, and tree-nuts allergy, as well as animal food allergies, including cow´s milk, red meat, egg, fish, and shellfish allergies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The present review explores the possibility of devising an inclusive eco-friendly strategy like microbiome engineering which proves to be a unique and crucial technology involving the power of microbial communication through quorum sensing. This review discusses the interspecies and intra-species communications between different microbial groups with their respective environments. Moreover, this review also envisages the efforts for designing the next level of microbiome-host engineering concept (MHEC). The focus of the review also extended toward using omics and metabolic network analysis-based tools for effective microbiome engineering. These approaches might be quite helpful in the future to understand such microbial interactions but it will be challenging to implement in the real environment to get the desired functions.

However, the symptoms can be successfully managed with proper medication and lifestyle interventions. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its etiology. In this review article, the up-to-date diagnostic features and parameters recommended on the grounds of evidence-based data and different guidelines are explored. The ambiguity and insufficiency of data when diagnosing adolescent women have been put under special focus. We look at some of the most recent research done to establish relationships between different gene polymorphisms with polycystic ovary syndrome in various populations along with the underestimated impact of environmental factors like endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the reproductive health of these women. Furthermore, the article concludes with existing treatments options and the scopes for advancement in the near future. Various therapies have been considered as potential treatment through multiple randomized controlled studies, and clinical trials conducted over the years are described in this article.

Fluoropolymers possess a unique combination of properties and unmatched functional performance critical to the products and manufacturing processes they enable and are irreplaceable in many uses. Fluoropolymers have documented safety profiles; are thermally, biologically, and chemically stable, negligibly soluble in water, nonmobile, nonbioavailable, nonbioaccumulative, and nontoxic. Although fluoropolymers fit the PFAS structural definition, they have very different physical, chemical, environmental, and toxicological properties when compared with other PFAS. This study describes the composition, uses, performance properties, and functionalities of 14 fluoropolymers, including fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers, and presents data to demonstrate that they satisfy the widely accepted polymer hazard assessment criteria to be considered polymers of low concern (PLC). The PLC criteria include physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, which determine bioavailability and warn of potential hazard. Fluoropolymers are insoluble (e.g., water, octanol) solids too large to migrate into the cell membrane making them nonbioavailable, and therefore, of low concern from a human and environmental health standpoint. Further, the study results demonstrate that fluoropolymers are a distinct and different group of PFAS and should not be grouped with other PFAS for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. When combined with an earlier publication by Henry et al., this study demonstrates that commercial fluoropolymers are available from the seven participating companies that meet the criteria to be considered PLC, which represent approximately 96% of the global commercial fluoropolymer market.

Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However, the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in this sense. © 2022, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).","Agriculture; Chemical contamination; Consumer products; Contamination; Ecosystems; Food supply; Industrial chemicals; Risk perception; Adverse effect; Consumables; Consumption; Food security; Industrial processs; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Product process; Shorter chains; Fish"

Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004–2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities.

They have been detected all over the globe, including at remote locations distant from any possible point sources. One mechanism for long-range transport of PFAS is through sorption to aerosol particles in the atmosphere. PFAS can be transferred from the sea surface to sea spray aerosol particles through wave breaking and bubble bursting, and PFAS emitted to the atmosphere in the gas phase can sorb to particulate matter through gas-particle partitioning. Here we present a comprehensive review of global measurements of PFAS on ambient particulate matter dating back to the first reports from the early 2000s. We summarize findings for the historically important C8 species, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), including detection of isomers and size-segregated measurements, as well as studies of newer and emerging PFAS.

ECs have been classified into various categories; however, this article focuses on the fate of major categories, namely pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), flame retardants, surfactants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and microplastics (MPs). These ECs when discharged to sewer and downstream wastewater treatment plants can undergo further transformations and either degrade, persist or convert into by-products which have the potential in some cases to be more hazardous. Because of potential dangerous impacts of the availability of these contaminants in the environment, information on the fate and behavior of these pollutants is highly important to develop new strategies, such as the regulation of chemicals imported into Australia and Australian consumer goods and environmental policies to mitigate them in a sustainable way. Moreover, advanced technologies are required for the detection and identification of novel contaminants emerging in the environment at ultra low levels. The application of chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectroscopy has provided attractive breakthroughs to detect new emerging contaminants. However, it is crucially important to understand the sensitivity and robustness of these analytical techniques when dealing with complex matrices such as biosolids. In addition, most of the literature was focused on selected compounds or a family of compounds and the existing reviews have paid less attention to examine the formation of metabolites during the wastewater treatment process and their impacts on the ecosystem. This review presents an overview of the presence of different classes of ECs around the world, their quantification from different sources like wastewater (influents or effluents), sludge and biosolids. In addition, the transformation of ECs during the treatment process, the formation of intermediate products and their impacts on the environment are also critically discussed.

PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

We evaluated CSF metabolomic and proteomic profiles based on the compartments and the diagnosis of spinal LM, proved by MRI from 20 paired ventricular and lumbar CSF samples of LM patients, including 12 spinal LM (+) samples. In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified—7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (−) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (−) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment. © 2022 by the authors.

Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although effective water treatment technologies exist for physical removal of many PFAS from water (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin), a PFAS-concentrated waste stream is generated as an end product that can potentially reintroduce PFAS back into the environment. Thus, there is an increased interest in developing destructive technologies to decompose and mineralize PFAS directly in water or in these waste streams. High energy electron beam (e-beam) accelerators have been used for water treatment to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant contaminants, including PFAS, since the 1960s. However, large-scale applications of e-beam for water treatment are restricted due to its high energy consumption and inability to treat large flow rates. Considering there are very few available technologies for destructive removal of PFAS, this study provides a critical review on the treatment of PFAS by direct irradiation of contaminated water by e-beam from an energy consumption point of view. To date, very limited studies have been conducted to investigate the success of this technology to treat PFAS. Results from the limited studies were not directly comparable due to the variation in operating conditions and water quality parameters used in the studies. Here, for the first time, we develop and apply the concept of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to assess the performance of e-beam for PFAS treatment. Results show that EE/O is a better performance parameter than the G value of e-beam for interstudy comparisons and to evaluate the effects of water quality and operating parameters on e-beam performance. We additionally developed a kinetic scheme to predict the performance of e-beam to treat PFAS and revealed that the competition between species to react with aqueous electrons is the determinant factor influencing PFAS degradation efficiency. Comparison of EE/O values of e-beam (range: 31−176 kWh m−3 order −1) with other destructive technologies (range: 5−9595 kWh m−3 order −1) suggest that e-beam, for PFAS treatment, is a promising approach under favorable conditions. This review further elucidates the feasibility and limitations of e-beam technology that could be improved upon to potentially make e-beam viable for large-scale water treatment applications. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",

PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2021","Amino acids; Chemical analysis; Linear regression; Metabolism; Metabolites; Unsaturated fatty acids; African american women; Bile acid; Biological pathways; Fetal growth; Gestational age; High-resolution metabolomics; Meet-in-the-middle; Perfluorononanoic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Biomarkers; 2 hexyl 3 phenyl 2 propenal; aldehyde; androgen; bile acid; ferulic acid; glycine; organofluorine derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; taurine; unclassified drug; unsaturated fatty acid; uric acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; biomarker; metabolism; metabolite; organohalogen; pregnancy; serum; adult; African American; amino acid metabolism; Article; bile acid metabolism; birth weight; cohort analysis; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; female; fetus; fetus growth; Georgia (U.S.); gestation period; hormone metabolism; human; infant; lipid metabolism; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; metabolite; metabolome; metabolomics; pregnancy; prematurity; prenatal exposure; risk factor; small for date infant; fetus development; maternal exposure; metabolomics; pollutant; pregnancy; toxicity; Atlanta; Georgia; United States; Atlanta; African Americans; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetal Development; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Metabolomics; Pregnancy"

To investigate whether these alterations reflect inadequate cell energy output, we assessed mitochondrial morphology and central metabolic pathways with emphasis on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in peripheral leukocytes from patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis, with and without ACLF. Methods: The study included samples from patients with AD cirrhosis (108 without and 128 with ACLF) and 41 healthy individuals. Leukocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy and cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic fluxes were determined by assessing NADH/FADH2 production from various substrates. Plasma GDF15 and FGF21 were determined by Luminex and acylcarnitines by LC-MS/MS. Gene expression was analyzed by RNA-sequencing and PCR-based glucose metabolism profiler array. Results: Mitochondrial ultrastructure in patients with advanced cirrhosis was distinguished by cristae rarefication and swelling. The number of mitochondria per leukocyte was higher in patients, accompanied by a reduction in their size. Increased FGF21 and C6:0- and C8:0-carnitine predicted mortality whereas GDF15 strongly correlated with a gene set signature related to leukocyte activation. Metabolic flux analyses revealed increased energy production in mononuclear leukocytes from patients with preferential involvement of extra-mitochondrial pathways, supported by upregulated expression of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. In patients with ACLF, mitochondrial function analysis uncovered break-points in the TCA cycle at the isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase level, which were bridged by anaplerotic reactions involving glutaminolysis and nucleoside metabolism. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence at the cellular, organelle and biochemical levels that severe mitochondrial dysfunction governs immunometabolism in leukocytes from patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF. Lay summary: Patients at advanced stages of liver disease have dismal prognosis due to vital organ failures and the lack of treatment options. In this study, we report that the functioning of mitochondria, which are known as the cell powerhouse, is severely impaired in leukocytes of these patients, probably as a consequence of intense inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore a hallmark of advanced liver disease. © 2021 The Authors","5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2); carnitine; fibroblast growth factor 21; growth differentiation factor 15; isocitrate dehydrogenase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; succinate dehydrogenase; immunologic factor; acute on chronic liver failure; Article; cell ultrastructure; citric acid cycle; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; disorders of mitochondrial functions; gene expression; glucose metabolism; glycolysis; human; human cell; leukocyte metabolism; liver cytosol; liver mitochondrion; metabolic flux analysis; mitochondrial volume; mitochondrion swelling; mononuclear cell; mortality; pentose phosphate cycle; polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequencing; transmission electron microscopy; acute on chronic liver failure; complication; disorders of mitochondrial functions; immunology; leukocyte; metabolism; microbiology; pathophysiology; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Leukocytes; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Mitochondrial Diseases; Tandem Mass Spectrometry"

These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management. © 2021","Biomarkers; Endocrine disrupters; Health; Health risks; Heavy metals; Indicators (chemical); Risk assessment; Toxicity; Disease risks; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Environmental exposure; Exposed to; Exposome; Metabolic biomarkers; Metabolic disease; Metabolism disrupting chemical; Metabolomes; Metabolomics; Metabolism; alkyl group; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; heavy metal; microplastic; organohalogen derivative; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; xenobiotic agent; biological marker; plastic; biomarker; disease; endocrine disruptor; health risk; metabolism; amino acid metabolism; analytic method; comparative study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental factor; exposomics; geographic distribution; health hazard; high throughput screening; human; laboratory test; lipid metabolism; mathematical computing; metabolic disorder; metabolism; metabolomics; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; prediction; public health; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; risk management; toxicity testing; validation process; animal; metabolomics; Animals; Biomarkers; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Metabolomics; Plastics"

Here, we review the toxic effects of PFASs encountered by various plants from physiological, biochemical and molecular perspectives. The exposure routes and bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites are also summarized. The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming. Future challenges and opportunities in PFAS phytotoxicity studies are also proposed in the review. © 2021 The Author(s)","Antioxidants; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Gene expression; Metabolism; Organic pollutants; Plants (botany); Risk assessment; Toxicity; Contaminated sites; Critical review; Inhibition concentrations; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Phytotoxicity; Plant; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Risks assessments; The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50); Toxic effect; Bioaccumulation; organic compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); inhibition; literature review; phytotoxicity; reactive oxygen species; bioaccumulation; biochemical analysis; biological activity; carbon metabolism; cell function; cell organelle; cell structure; concentration (parameter); contamination; environmental exposure; gene; gene expression; IC50; metabolic regulation; metabolic reprogramming; metallothionein gene; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phenotype; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; plant; plant cell; plant growth; plant stress; protein synthesis; Review; toxicity testing; bioaccumulation; ecosystem; plant; water pollutant; Bioaccumulation; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Plants; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

In this comprehensive worldwide review, we collected ecotoxicology and concentration data observed in surface water for 53 high-potency EDs and performed a risk assessment. The compounds were selected from the EU watchlist of priority substances, expanded with new compounds of emerging concern (total 41), where quantifiable data were available for the past three years (2018–2020). The risk quotients ranged from <0.01 for 22 substances to 1974 for tamoxifen. The frequency of samples in which the predicted no-effect concentrations were exceeded also varied, from 1.8% to 92.7%. By using the comprehensive multi-parameter risk assessment in our study, the most current to date, we determined that tamoxifen, imidacloprid, clothianidin, four bisphenols (BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPAF), PFOA, amoxicillin, and three steroid hormones (estriol, estrone, and cyproterone) pose significant risks in the environment. Comparing two structurally very similar bisphenols, BPA and BPB, suggested that the risk from BPB is currently underestimated by at least four orders of magnitude due to the lack of ecotoxicological data availability. The methodological limitations encountered suggest that a standardized methodology for data selection and assessment is necessary, highlighting the fact that some substances are currently under-represented in the field of ecotoxicological research. A new prioritization system is therefore presented, which provides a potential basis for new substances to be included in environmental monitoring lists. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic organisms; Ecology; Endocrine disrupters; Endocrinology; Phenols; Steroid hormones; Surface waters; Bisphenols; Eco-toxicology; Ecotoxicological; Endocrine-disruptors; Multi-parameter risk assessment; Multiparameters; Priority index; Property; Risks assessments; Tamoxifen; Risk assessment; acetamiprid; amoxicillin; androstenedione; azithromycin; bazedoxifene; beta lactam antibiotic; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; clomifene; clothianidin; corticosterone; cyproterone; desogestrel; endocrine disruptor; erythromycin; estradiol; estriol; estrone; ethinylestradiol; gentamicin; imidacloprid; macrolide; metaflumizone; methiocarb; ospemifene; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; phenol derivative; progesterone; quinolone derivative; raloxifene; surface water; tamoxifen; testosterone; thiacloprid; thiamethoxam; tibolone; tobramycin; toremifene; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; ecotoxicology; endocrine disruptor; environmental monitoring; methodology; risk assessment; secondary metabolite; surface water; acute toxicity; aquatic environment; aquatic species; Article; data availability; ecotoxicology; effective concentration; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; health hazard; information retrieval; no-observed-effect concentration; peer review; persistent organic pollutant; publication; risk assessment; sampling; Scopus; search engine; surface property; Web of Science; ecotoxicology; human; Aquatic Organisms; Ecotoxicology; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment"

However, the inherent cause of aggregation capacity related to the ratio of COD to nitrogen (COD/N) is still unclear. In this study, metabolomics analysis was combined with microbiological analyses, granular performance and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure to explore the granulation mechanism at different influent COD/N ratios. The results showed that the higher COD/N ratio selectively enhanced the gluconeogenesis pathway, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathway, resulting in more extracellular polysaccharide (PS) excretion and floc sludge. The absence of carbon source weakened tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) reaction, resulting in NAD+ and ADP decrease, nitrite accumulation and change of microbial community structure. The amino acids biosynthesis pathway was enhanced under low COD/N ratio, which promoted the hydrophobicity of EPS. PDGS had stronger Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-based quorum sensing (QS) than DGS during the operational period. CO8-HSL, C8-HSL and C6-HSL, as the main form of AHLs, played a dominating role in DGS and PDGS. Batch tests illustrated that adding AHLs obviously improved the synthesis of the amino acids, threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp), methionine (Met) and glycine (Gly). Dosing AHLs regulated PS synthesis only at a high COD/N ratio. The glucose-6P, glycerate-3p and UDP-Glc were up-regulated only in DSG, which increased the hydrophilic groups in EPS.

Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver. Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2021","ascorbic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; animal; cross-sectional study; mouse; Animals; Ascorbic Acid; Caprylates; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fluorocarbons; Mice"

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite having similar physicochemical properties, enantiomers may differ in their interactions with enzymes, receptors and other chiral molecules leading to different biological response. Their differences in bio-degradation, transformation or accumulation should be carefully considered when assessing health risks since they can affect living organisms in a different way. This work reviews the behavior of several groups of environmentally relevant chiral contaminants including pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, perfluoroalkyl substances, brominated flame retardants, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and their main metabolites. The enantioselectivity and fate of these compounds in: i) wastewater treatment plants, ii) aquatic and terrestrial environments; and iii) living organisms is discussed. It cannot be predicted whether each specific enantiomer of a chiral compound will be preferably enriched or degraded. The extent of stereoselectivity is associated to several factors, including the specific chiral pollutant, the environmental matrix, the treatment technology used, as well as the season and local environmental factors (pH, soil texture, porosity, organic amended), which are in turn influenced by the activity of the microbial communities. Therefore the environmental fate of enantiomers always needs to be investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aquatic organisms; Enantiomers; Enantioselectivity; Environmental technology; Flame retardants; Health risks; Metabolites; Organic pollutants; Physicochemical properties; Risk assessment; Sewage treatment plants; Textures; Wastewater treatment; Brominated flame retardants; Environmental contaminant; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Personal care products; Pharmaceutical compounds; Terrestrial environments; Treatment technologies; Wastewater treatment plants; Stereochemistry; bromine; flame retardant; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; degradation; drug; environment; environmental fate; physicochemical property; pollutant; wastewater treatment plant; biodegradation; bioremediation; chirality; enantiomer; enantioselectivity; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental risk; health hazard; nonhuman; pH; pollutant; porosity; Review; soil texture; waste water treatment plant"

However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%. Finally, the future development of further research and few suggestions are also prospected. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adsorption; Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Bioproducts; Costs; Desorption; Efficiency; Environmental technology; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water supply; Adsorption performance; Desorption efficiency; Emerging pollutants; Environmental pollution control; Environmental remediation; Perfluorinated compounds; Personal care products; Various technologies; Pollution control"

As most biological and chemical destruction methods have so far shown limited efficiencies, adsorption, a simple and cost-effective treatment, is widely adopted for the removal of PFAS from water/wastewater. This paper aims to review the recent progress in PFAS adsorption using various adsorbents. The performance of different types of adsorbents, including the traditional carbonaceous materials and resins as well as the newly-synthesized minerals, biomaterials, and polymers, in PFAS removal was summarized. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms were critically reviewed. Real-life adsorption applications (large-scale setups, adsorption-involved treatment trains and point-of-use/point-of-entry systems) were also examined. Learned lessons, current challenges and recommendations on future research were provided regarding results of tests in real environmental matrices, pilot and/or field scale studies of promising newly-developed adsorbents, and the improvement of the removal of alternative PFAS (mostly short-chained ones). © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adsorption; Biomaterials; Cost effectiveness; Potable water; Water treatment; Adsorption characteristic; Adsorptive removal; Carbonaceous materials; Cost effective treatments; Drinking water sources; Environmental matrixes; Point of use; Recent progress; Driers (materials); biomaterial; mineral; polymer; resin; adsorption; chemical compound; drinking water; pollutant removal; testing method; adsorption; Article; isotherm; kinetics; wastewater"
