TI  - Multifunctional Membranes-A Versatile Approach for Emerging Pollutants Removal
T2  - MEMBRANES
AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive literature review surveying the most important polymer materials used for electrospinning processes and applied as membranes for the removal of emerging pollutants. Two types of processes integrate these membrane types: separation processes, where electrospun polymers act as a support for thin film composites (TFC), and adsorption as single or coupled processes (photo-catalysis, advanced oxidation, electrochemical), where a functionalization step is essential for the electrospun polymer to improve its properties. Emerging pollutants (EPs) released in the environment can be efficiently removed from water systems using electrospun membranes. The relevant results regarding removal efficiency, adsorption capacity, and the size and porosity of the membranes and fibers used for different EPs are described in detail.

TI  - Legacy and emerging pollutants in Latin America: A critical review of occurrence and levels in environmental and food samples
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The increase and indiscriminate use of personal care products, food products, fertilizers, pesticides, and health products, among others, have resulted/are resulting in extensive environmental contamination. Most of these products contain traces of widespread chemicals, usually known as emerging pollutants (EPs) or pollutants of emerging concern (PEC). The Latin American (LA) region comprises 20 countries with different social and cultural aspects, with 81 % of the population living in urban areas. The LA region has some countries on the top list of users/consumers of EPs, from pesticides and fertilizers to personal care products. However, there is a gap in information related to the distribution of EPs in the environment of this region, with very few existing review texts exploring this issue. Therefore, this present paper advances this approach. An exhaustive literature review, with the selection of 176 documents, provided unique up-to-date information on the presence/distribution of 17 classes of legacy or emerging pollutants in different food and environmental matrices (soil, sediment, water, and air). The study shows that the wide distribution and recorded levels of these pollutants in the continental environment are potential risks to human health, mainly through food and drinking water ingestion. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are pollutants of deep public concern since they show carcinogenic properties. Several classes of pollutants, like endocrine disruptors, have caused harmful effects on humans and the environment. Besides that, pharmaceutical products and pesticides are compounds of high consumption worldwide, being environmental contamination a real and ongoing possibility. Finally, gaps and future research needs are deeply pointed out.

TI  - Accurate Removal of Toxic Organic Pollutants from Complex Water Matrices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Characteristic emerging pollutants at low concentration have raised much attention for causing a bottleneck in water remediation, especially in complex water matrices where high concentration of interferents coexist. In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science.

TI  - Individual and mixture associations of perfluoroalkyl substances on liver function biomarkers in the Canadian Health Measures Survey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background Perfluoroalkyl substances can disrupt hepatic metabolism and may be associated with liver function biomarkers. We examined individual and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on metabolic disorders. Methods We analyzed data from participants aged 20-74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5% (95%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada's physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6% (95%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2% change; 95%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2% change; 95%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5% change; 95%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5% higher; 95%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7% higher; 95%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8% higher; 95%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA - both individually and as a mixture - were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the hepatotoxic effects of PFAS.

TI  - Association Between Exposure to Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Birth Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: A large body of emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) affect birth outcomes in various pathways, but the evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summtary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from -181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = -360.620 to -1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to -24.252 g (95% CI = -38.574 to -9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be "moderate ". Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

TI  - A systematic review on toxicity assessment of persistent emerging pollutants (EPs) and associated microplastics (MPs) in the environment using the Hydra animal model
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Emerging pollutants (EPs) are causative for teratogenic and reproductive effects. EPs are detected in all the environmental matrices at higher levels. A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4 ',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species. Genome sequencing helps to know the mode of action of pollutants, role of enzymes in detoxification, defense genes and stress responsive genes. Molecular techniques were used to obtain the information for evolutionary changes of genes and modulation of gene expression by EPs.

TI  - Microbiome engineering for bioremediation of emerging pollutants
T2  - BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - Axenic microbial applications in the open environment are unrealistic and may not be always practically viable. Therefore, it is important to use mixed microbial cultures and their interactions with the microbiome in the targeted ecosystem to perform robust functions towards their sustainability in harsh environmental conditions. Emerging pollutants like phthalates and hydrocarbons that are toxic to several aquatic and terrestrial life forms in the water bodies and lands are an alarming situation. The present review explores the possibility of devising an inclusive eco-friendly strategy like microbiome engineering which proves to be a unique and crucial technology involving the power of microbial communication through quorum sensing. This review discusses the interspecies and intra-species communications between different microbial groups with their respective environments. Moreover, this review also envisages the efforts for designing the next level of microbiome-host engineering concept (MHEC). The focus of the review also extended toward using omics and metabolic network analysis-based tools for effective microbiome engineering. These approaches might be quite helpful in the future to understand such microbial interactions but it will be challenging to implement in the real environment to get the desired functions. Finally, the review also discusses multiple approaches for the bioremediation of toxic chemicals from the soil environment.

TI  - Peracetic acid-based advanced oxidation processes for the degradation of emerging pollutants: A critical review
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB  - An ever-increasing number of anthropogenic pollutants, referred to as emerging pollutants (EPs), have been of concern in recent years. These pollutants are known for the potential risk that they pose in the environment, and have been consistently found in surface, waste, and potable waters. Moreover, some of them are persistent to conventional treatments and in the environment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely used tech-nology for the removal of EPs The use of peracetic acid (PAA) as an oxidant AOP for the treatment of EPs has attracted increasing interest, owing to its ease of activation, and to the selectivity of the organic radicals that are generated in these processes towards electron rich sites, which makes them more robust against the effect of scavenging agents in real matrices. This work presents a critical analysis of the advantages, disadvantages, and opportunities of PAA-based processes. Several strategies for PAA activation were analyzed, including UV and transition metal activation, heterogeneous catalysis, thermal and microwave activation, and phosphate induced activation. It was found that PAA-based AOPs seem to have several advantages over other widely studied pro-cesses. Some key perspectives for research include testing of these processes with a variety of EPs, analysis of transformation products and their toxicity in the treated effluents, multivariate optimization of the process, direct comparison with widely studied oxidants, and experimentation for escalation and implementation. Nevertheless, PAA-based AOPs seem to be a promising alternative to conventional AOPs.

TI  - Employing electro-peroxone process for industrial wastewater treatment: a critical review
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - Recently, the electro-peroxone process has advent rapidly as an efficient and new electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) to treat pollutants, which is operated through in situ generations of H2O2 from cathodic O-2 reduction during the ozonation process. The electro-generated hydrogen peroxide leads to the improvement in ozone transformation to hydroxyl radical; hence, the electro-peroxone can considerably improve the treatment performance, total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization, and reduction of ozone-resistant emerging pollutants compared with the traditional ozonation process. Moreover, the main disadvantage of the traditional ozonation process for water treatment is bromate generation during the treatment of bromide-containing water sources, which can be remarkably decreased by the application of this technology. Additionally, because of its enhanced kinetics of contaminant degradation, electro-peroxone offers a more secure, time-efficient, energy-saving, and effective alternative for the reduction of emerging pollutants, compared with different ozone-dependent AOPs including traditional UV/O-3 and peroxone (O-3/H2O2) methods. Hence, it can offer a suitable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to markedly enhance the efficiency of the current ozonation process. This paper reviews the principles of the electro-peroxone process and compares its efficiency with other methods. The essential reaction mechanisms and experimental parameters that are crucial to the operation, realization, and design of the electro-peroxone, including ozone dosage, applied current, injected ozone flowrate, electrolyte type, electrode setup, solution pH, and type of cathode and anode on electro-peroxone efficiency, are investigated. Moreover, the application of electro-peroxone for water and wastewater treatment is explored. Finally, the challenges in wide-ranging application of electro-peroxone, the future research direction, and its incorporation in wastewater and water treatment systems for viable application are discussed.

TI  - Global Exposure to Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Associated Burden of Low Birthweight
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Low birthweight (LBW) is a worldwide public health concern, while the global burden of LBW attributable to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has not yet been evaluated. Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions. Although our estimation may be constrained by uncertainties from the dose-response curve and data availability, this study has unveiled that PFAS might be a contributor to global LBW prevalence during 2000-2019, supporting continuous actions to mitigate PFAS contamination.

TI  - Perfluoroalkyl substances and lipid concentrations in the blood: A systematic review of epidemiological studies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used synthetic aliphatic compounds. This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for rele-vant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (>= 18 years old) and children. Primary find-ings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between con-centrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were per-formed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool.Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associa-tions between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations.Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human popula-tions. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking. (300 words)

TI  - Emerging adsorbents for micro/nanoplastics removal from contaminated water: Advances and perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) are emerging pollutants in the water environment. MPs/NPs' high buoyant and persistent properties and potential toxic effects on living organisms make them priority pollutants in water. To overcome plastic pollution, great efforts have been made to remove MPs/NPs from contaminated water. Recently, adsorption has been proved as an efficient strategy, and emerging adsorbents have shown promising removal performance. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in adsorbents for the eradication of MPs/NPs from water. Engineered adsorbents (e.g., carbon materials, sponge/aerogel/fiber materials, metal (hydr)oxides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)) are first summarized, and the adsorbents' structure-performance correlation is emphasized. Afterward, critical experimental factors (e.g., pH value, metal ions, anions, dissolved organic matters (DOM)) are analyzed. At last, challenges and prospects in this field are highlighted to guide the development of novel high-performance adsorbents for MPs/NPs pollution control.

TI  - Advances in bioremediation of emerging contaminants from industrial wastewater by oxidoreductase enzymes
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The bioremediation of emerging recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater via enzyme biotechnology has been evolving as cost-effective with an input of low-energy technological approach. However, the enzyme based bioremediation technology is still not fully developed at a commercial level. The oxidoreductases being the domineering biocatalysts are promising candidates for wastewater treatments. Henceforth, comprehending their global market and biotransformation efficacy is mandatory for establishing these techno-economic bio-enzymes in commercial scale. The biocatalytic strategy can be established as a combinatorial approach with existing treatment technology to achieve towering bioremediation and effective removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater. This review provides a novel insight on the toxicological xenobiotics released from industries such as paper and pulps, soap and detergents, pharmaceuticals, textiles, pesticides, explosives and aptitude of peroxidases, nitroreductase and cellobiose dehydrogenase in their bio-based treatment. Moreover, the review comprehensively covers environmental relevance of wastewater pollution and the critical challenges based on remediation achieved through biocatalysts for future prospectives.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of 3D primary mouse liver spheroids shows that long-term exposure to hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid disrupts hepatic bile acid metabolism
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA), an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected in various environmental and human matrices. However, information regarding its toxicity remains limited. Here, we established a three-dimensional (3D) primary mouse liver spheroid model to compare the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-TA and PFOA. The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-mu M HFPOTA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-mu M HFPO TA-and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-mu M HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-mu M PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-mu M HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human bio-monitoring measurements.
   Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail.
   Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals.

TI  - Associations between Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Exposure and Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent pollutants that may cause breast cancer. However, associations between exposure to PFASs and the risk of breast cancer are controversial. We retrieved studies on the association between PFASs-perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)-and breast cancer risk in women from PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted or calculated from provided data. Moreover, subgroup and metaregression analyses were performed to distinguish the potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. Lastly, eight original studies were included in the meta-analysis. PFOA and PFHxS were positively correlated with breast cancer risk, and the pooled ORs (and 95% CIs) were 1.32 (1.19 and 1.46) and 1.79 (1.51 and 2.11), respectively. PFNA was negatively correlated with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 0.76 (0.6 and 0.96), and PFOS was shown to have no correlation with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 1.01 (0.87 and 1.17). All results were merged in a random-effects model with significant heterogeneities (I-2 > 90%, p < 0.001). The results demonstrated that PFASs might be potential risk factors for breast cancer, and the compounds in low exposure levels could have a more harmful impact on human health.

TI  - Engineered biochar: A way forward to environmental remediation
T2  - FUEL
AB  - The accelerated urbanization and industrialization worldwide has increased the pollution via toxic chemicals, thus generating environmental hazards to public health and ecosystems. As a consequence, the national authorities and scientists are paying more attention to the development and implementation of viable cost-effective detoxification solutions. Biochar has emerged as a biomass-derived material that can be produced through a variety of feedstocks and carbonization techniques. Distinct characteristics of biochar can be appropriate, costeffective, and eco-friendly for removing a wide spectrum of inorganic and organic pollutants. This review aims to emphasize the crucial function of biochar-based materials in the abatement of toxic emerging pollutants. It covers the synthesis and applications of engineered biochars by discussing extensive research and knowledge in this area. The relationships of biochar properties with feedstock, synthesis conditions, technologies and modification methods have also been discussed. Biochars with different surface functionalities (e.g., COO-, Fe-O, etc.,) can be obtained by either varying the feedstock material (lignocellulosic or non-lignocellulosic) or by modifying it with different chemicals (e.g., metal ions, rare earth elements, surfactants) including the preparation of composites. The interaction mechanisms between biochar and various pollutants are reviewed and analyzed. The type of interactions (e.g., electrostatic, pi-pi stacking, hydrogen bonding) depends on the different surface functionalities of biochar. This review also illustrates that biochar and its related composites have shown remarkable properties and versatility for their effective application in adsorption, photocatalysis and oxidation processes in aqueous phase. Finally, prospective research directions and opportunity areas for biochar research are also discussed. The article provides a comprehensive review on the production, modification and environmental application of engineered biochar.

TI  - Pharmaceuticals in water as emerging pollutants for river health: A critical review under Indian conditions
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - The wastewaters from pharmaceutical manufacturing units, hospitals, and domestic sewage contaminated with excretal matters of medicine users are the prime sources of pharmaceutical pollutants (PPs) in natural water bodies. In the present study, PPs have been considered one of the emerging pollutants (EPs) and a cause of concern in river health assessment. Beyond the reported increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ABRB), PPs have been found adversely affecting the biotic diversity in such water environments. Considering Algae, Mac-roinvertebrates, and Fishes as three distinct trophic level indicators, the present study puts forward a framework for showing River Health Condition (RHC) based on the calculation of a River Health Index (RHI). The RHI is calculated using six Indicator Group Scores (IGS) which individually reflect river health in a defined category of water quality characteristics. While Dissolved Oxygen Related Parameters (DORP), Nutrients (NT), and PPs are taken as causative agents affecting RHCs, scores of Algal-Bacterial (AB) symbiosis, Macroinvertebrates (MI), and Fishes (F) are considered as an effect of such environmental conditions. Current wastewater treatment tech-nologies are also not very effective in the removal of PPs. The objective of the present study is to review the harmful effects of PPs on the aquatic environment, particularly on the chemical and biotic indicators of river health. Based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in the aquatic environment and measured environmental concentration (MEC) in the river, the estimated risk quotient (RQ) for norfloxacin in the Isakavagu-Nakkavagu stream of river Godavari, Hyderabad is found 293 for algae, 39 for MI, and 335 for fish. Among PPs, in Indian rivers, the presence of caffeine is the most frequent, with algae at the highest level of risk (RQmax= 24.5).Broadly six PPs, including azithromycin, caffeine, diclofenac, naproxen, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole are found above PNEC values in Indian rivers. The application of IGS and RHI in understanding and presenting the river health condition (RHC) through colored hexagons has been demonstrated for the river Ganga near Varanasi (India) as an example. Identification of critical indicator groups, based on IGS provides a scientific basis for planned intervention for river health restoration to achieve an acceptable category.

TI  - Emerging technologies for PFOS/PFOA degradation and removal: A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are highly recalcitrant anthropogenic chemicals that are ubiquitously present in the environment and are harmful to humans. Typical water and wastewater treatment processes (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are proven to be largely ineffective, while adsorption with granular activated carbon (GAC) has been the chief option to capture them from aqueous sources followed by incineration. However, this process is time-consuming, and produces additional solid waste and air pollution. Treatment methods for PFOS and PFOA generally follow two routes: (1) removal from source and reduce the risk; (2) degradation. Emerging technologies focusing on degradation are critically reviewed in this contribution. Various processes such as bioremediation, electrocoagulation, foam fractionation, sonolysis, photocatalysis, mechanochemical, electrochemical degradation, beams of electron and plasma have been developed and studied in the past decade to address PFAS crisis. The underlying mechanisms of these PFAS degradation methods have been categorized. Two main challenges have been identified, namely complexity in large scale operation and the release of toxic byproducts. Based on the literature survey, we have provided a strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis and quantitative rating on their efficiency, environmental impact and technology readiness.

TI  - Finding Biomarkers in Antioxidant Molecular Mechanisms for Ensuring Food Safety of Bivalves Threatened by Marine Pollution
T2  - ANTIOXIDANTS
AB  - Aquaculture production as an important source of protein for our diet is sure to continue in the coming years. However, marine pollution will also likely give rise to serious problems for the food safety of molluscs. Seafood is widely recognized for its high nutritional value in our diet, leading to major health benefits. However, the threat of marine pollution including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and other emerging pollutants is of ever-growing importance and seafood safety may not be guaranteed. New approaches for the search of biomarkers would help us to monitor pollutants and move towards a more global point of view; protocols for the aquaculture industry would also be improved. Rapid and accurate detection of food safety problems in bivalves could be carried out easily by protein biomarkers. Hence, proteomic technologies could be considered as a useful tool for the discovery of protein biomarkers as a first step to improve the protocols of seafood safety. It has been demonstrated that marine pollutants are altering the bivalve proteome, affecting many biological processes and molecular functions. The main response mechanism of bivalves in a polluted marine environment is based on the antioxidant defense system against oxidative stress. All these proteomic data provided from the literature suggest that alterations in oxidative stress due to marine pollution are closely linked to robust and confident biomarkers for seafood safety.

TI  - Sewage sludge-derived biochar for the adsorptive removal of wastewater pollutants: A critical review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - The production of biochar from sewage sludge pyrolysis is a promising approach to transform the waste resultant from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to a potential adsorbent. The current review provides an up-to-date review regarding important aspects of sewage sludge pyrolysis, highlighting the process that results major solid fraction (biochar), as high-value product. Further, the physio-chemical characteristics of sewage-sludge derived biochar such as the elemental composition, specific surface area, pore size and volume, the functional groups, surface morphology and heavy metal content are discussed. Recent progress on adsorption of metals, emerging pollutants, dyes, nutrients and oil are discussed and the results are examined. The sewage sludge-derived biochar is a promising material that can make significant contributions on pollutants removal from water by adsorption and additional benefit of the management of huge volume of sewage. Considering all these aspects, this field of research still needs more attention from the researchers in the direction of the technological features and sustainability aspects.

TI  - Multi-omics analysis reveals the molecular responses of Torreya grandis shoots to nanoplastic pollutant
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Micro/nanoplastic has become an emerging pollutant of global concern. At present, ecotoxic researches on micro/nanoplastics mostly focus on marine aquatic organisms and freshwater algae. Research on the ecological impacts of plastics on higher terrestrial plants, especially on forest plants, is relatively limited. Torreya grandis cv. Merrillii, a species of conifer in the family Taxaceae, is a unique and economically valuable tree species in China. The physiological and biochemical responses of T. grandis seedlings to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) with a diameter of 100 nm were systematically studied inthe present study. The results showed that nanoplastics enhanced the accumulation of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and the activities of catalase and peroxidase. The concentrations of iron, sulfur, and zinc were reduced after nanoplastic exposure. PSNP treatment had an important effect on a series of chemical and genetic indicators of T. grandis, includingantioxidants, small RNA, gene transcription, protein expressions, and metabolite accumulation. Multi-omic analysis revealed that PSNPs modulate terpenoid- and flavonoid-biosynthesis pathways by regulating small RNA transcription and protein expression. Our study provided novelty insights into the responses of forest plants to nanoplastic treatment.

TI  - Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and semen quality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Some studies have suggested that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure may be associated with semen quality in the general population, but with inconsistent results. To identify a more precise relationship between them, a meta-analysis was performed. We searched Embase, the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Ovid databases, and Web of Science databases (before March 2022) for appropriate studies on the correlations of PFAS exposure with semen parameters. We extracted beta value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to conduct meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses was performed by sample size, geographic location, and sample type. A total of seven articles involving 2190 participants were included in this study. The concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (beta value = - 1.38; 95% CI: - 2.44, - 0.32) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (beta value = - 1.31, 95% CI: - 2.35, - 0.26) were negatively associated with sperm progressive motility. Subgroup analysis revealed that PFNA exposure was related to sperm morphology in studies with the sample size exceeding 200 people (beta value = - 0.14; 95% CI: - 0.26, - 0.01). Our study supports that exposure to some PFASs (e.g., PFNA, PFOA) may be associated with semen quality, such as lower sperm progressive motility. Therefore, it is of great significance for the prevention of male infertility by control the use of PFASs.

TI  - Global distributions, source-type dependencies, and concentration ranges of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in groundwater
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted of published literature reporting concentrations of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater for sites distributed in 20 countries across the globe. Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to-7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to-5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is-15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a "background" concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health.

TI  - Photodegradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water: A review of fundamentals and applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, mobile, and toxic chemicals that are hazardous to human health and the environment. Several countries, including the United States, plan to set an enforceable maximum contamination level for certain PFAS compounds in drinking water sources. Among the available treatment options, photocatalytic treatment is promising for PFAS degradation and mineralization in the aqueous solution. In this review, recent advances in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo -reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS by photo-oxidation involving the holes (h(vb)(+)) and oxidative radicals and photo-reduction using the electrons (e(cb)(-)) and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)) are inte-grated. The recent development of innovative heterogeneous photocatalysts and photolysis systems for enhanced degradation of PFAS is highlighted. Photodegradation mechanisms of alternative compounds, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), are also critically evaluated. This paper concludes by identifying major knowledge gaps and some of the challenges that lie ahead in the scalability and adaptability issues of photocatalysis for natural water treatment. Development made in photocatalysts design and system optimization forges a path toward sustainable treatment of PFAS-contaminated water through photodegradation technologies.

TI  - Toxicity of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances to Aquatic Invertebrates, Planktons, and Microorganisms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), recognized worldwide as emerging pollutants, may pose a substantial threat to human health and our environment due to their stability, high concentrations, wide distribution, and easy accumulation. Ever since perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were recognized by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the public has become increasingly concerned about potential contamination and the environmental risks associated with PFASs. Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes.

TI  - Chronic effects of benzalkonium chlorides on short chain fatty acids and methane production in semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As an emerging pollutant, benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) potentially enriched in waste activated sludge (WAS). How-ever, the microbial response mechanism under chronic effects of BACs on acidogenesis and methanogenesis in anaer-obic digestion (AD) has not been clearly disclosed. This study investigated the AD (by-)products and microbial evolution under low to high BACs concentrations from bioreactor startup to steady running. It was found that BACs can lead to an increase of WAS hydrolysis and fermentation, but a disturbance to acidogenic bacteria also occurred at low BACs concentration. A noticeable inhibition to methanogenesis occurred when BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g TSS. Metagenomic analysis revealed the key genes involved in acetic acid (HAc) biosynthesis (i.e. phosphate acetyltransferase, PTA), beta-oxidation pathway (acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase) and propionic acid (HPr) conversion was slightly promoted compared with control. Furthermore, BACs inhibited the acetotrophic methanogenesis (i.e. acetyl-CoA synthetase), especially BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g TSS, thereby enhanced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) accumulation. Overall, chronic stimulation of functional microorganisms with increasing concentrations of BACs impact WAS fermentation.

TI  - Exposure to per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Markers of Liver Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence indicates that exposure to certain pollutants is associated with liver damage. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies.
   METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PEAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect.
   RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PEAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PEOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PENA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0.001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0.001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p =0.023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis.
   CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PEAS, mixtures, and early life exposures.

TI  - Leveraging Systematic Reviews to Explore Disease Burden and Costs of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Exposures in the United States
T2  - EXPOSURE AND HEALTH
AB  - Accelerating evidence confirms the contribution of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to disease burden and disability across the lifespan. Given that policy makers raise the high cost of remediation and of substituting PFAS with safer alternatives in consumer products as barriers to confronting adverse health outcomes associated with PFAS exposure, it is important to document the costs of inaction even in the presence of uncertainty. We therefore quantified disease burdens and related economic costs due to legacy PFAS exposures in the US in 2018. We leveraged systematic reviews and used meta-analytic inputs whenever possible, identified previously published exposure-response relationships, and calculated PFOA- and PFOS-attributable increases in 13 conditions. These increments were then applied to census data to determine total annual PFOA- and PFOS-attributable cases of disease, from which we calculated economic costs due to medical care and lost productivity using previously published cost-of-illness data. We identified PFAS-attributable disease costs in the US of $5.52 billion across five primary disease endpoints shown to be associated with PFAS exposure in meta-analyses. This estimate represented the lower bound, with sensitivity analyses revealing as much as $62.6 billion in overall costs. While further work is needed to assess probability of causation and establish with greater certainty effects of the broader category of PFAS, the results confirm further that public health and policy interventions are still necessary to reduce exposure to PFOA and PFOS and their endocrine-disrupting effects. This study demonstrates the large potential economic implications of regulatory inaction.

TI  - A comprehensive review on current technologies for removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals from wastewaters
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - In the recent years, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) has received increasing attention due to their significant toxic effects on human beings and wildlife by affecting their endocrine systems. As an important group of emerging pollutant, EDCs have been detected in various aquatic environments, including surface waters, groundwater, wastewater, runoff, and landfill leachates. Their removal from water resources has also been an emerging concern considering growing population as well as reducing access to fresh water resources. EDC removal from wastewaters is highly dependent on physicochemical properties of the given EDCs present in each wastewater types as well as various aquatic environments. Due to chemical, physical and physicochemical diversities in these parameters, variety of technologies consisting of physical, biological, electrochemical, and chemical processes have been developed for their removal. This review highlights that the effectiveness of EDC removal is highly dependent of selecting the appropriate technology; which decision is made upon a full wastewater chemical characterization. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective about all the current technologies used for EDCs removal from various aquatic matrices along with rising challenges such as the antimicrobial resistance gene transfer during EDC treatment.

TI  - Bioaerogels, the emerging technology for wastewater treatment: A comprehensive review on synthesis, properties and applications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Over the past decade use of aerogels has received much attention as an emerging technology for wastewater treatment. However, production of aerogels is not environment-friendly. Owing to its excellent properties such as porosity, three-dimensional structure, being amenable to chemical modifications, it is imperative to devise strategies for their improved production and use. Bioaerogels are non-toxic and most of their precursor com-pounds are biomass-derived. This review aims to present a comprehensive report on survey of existing literature published on the use of bioaerogels for removal of all major categories of water contaminants, namely, heavy metals, industrial dyes, oil, organic compounds and pharmaceuticals. It also gives critical analysis of the lacunae in the existing knowledge such as lack of studies on domestic sewage, emerging pollutants, toxicity of raw materials and adequate disposal of used adsorbents. Proposals of overcoming the limitations in the applicability of bioaerogels, like combining constructed wetlands with use of bioaerogels, among others have been discussed. In this review, emphasis has been given on production of bioaerogels, with an aim to underscore the potential of valorization of biomass waste to develop novel materials for wastewater treatment in an effort towards creating a circular and green economy.

TI  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances target and alter human prostate stem-progenitor cells
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a large family of widely used synthetic chemicals that are environmentally and biologically persistent and present in most individuals. Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3-4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures.

TI  - Impact of a hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) exposure on impairing the gut microbiota in mice
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) has been used as an alternative of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the fluoropolymer industry for several years. HFPO-TA is reported to have high capability of bioaccumulation, widespread environmental distribution, and multiple toxicities. However, its potential toxicity on the intestines and gut microbiota remains unknown. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed to 200 mu g/L HFPO-TA for 6 weeks, and after total genomic DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing was performed. Our results demonstrated that HFPO-TA exposure resulted in the imbalance of cecal microbiota and alterations of cecal microbiota diversity. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Tenericutes increased in mice after exposure to HFPO-TA, while the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and TM7 decreased. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ver Akkermansia, Pre Prevotella, Lac Coprococcus, Por_Parabacteroides, and Lac Dorea decreased in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Meanwhile, the increased relative abundances of Def_Mucispirillum, Des_Desulfovibrio and Odo Odoribacter were observed in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Additionally, KEGG metabolic pathway analysis revealed that HFPO-TA exposure changed the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism pathway and other metabolic pathways. Collectively, all these findings

TI  - Health-related toxicity of emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: Comparison to legacy PFOS and PFOA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent, manufactured chemicals used in various manufacturing processes and found in numerous commercial products. With over 9000 compounds belonging to this chemical class, there is increasing concern regarding human exposure to these compounds due to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic nature. Human exposure to PFAS may occur from a variety of exposure sources, including, air, food, indoor dust, soil, water, from the transfer of PFAS from non-stick wrappers to food, use of cosmetics, and other personal care products. This critical review presents recent research on the healthrelated impacts of PFAS exposure, highlighting compounds other than Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) that cause adverse health effects, updates the current state of knowledge on PFAS toxicity, and, where possible, elucidates cause-and-effect relationships. Recent reviews identified that exposure to PFAS was associated with adverse health impacts on female and male fertility, metabolism in pregnancy, endocrine function including pancreatic dysfunction and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, lipid metabolism and risk of childhood adiposity, hepatic and renal function, immune function, cardiovascular health (atherosclerosis), bone health including risk for dental cavities, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency, neurological function, and risk of developing breast cancer. However, while cause-and-effect relationships for many of these outcomes were not able to be clearly elucidated, it was identified that 1) the evidence derived from both animal models and humans suggested that PFAS may exert harmful impacts on both animals and humans, however extrapolating data from animal to human studies was complicated due to differences in exposure/elimination kinetics, 2) PFAS precursor kinetics and toxicity mechanism data are still limited despite ongoing exposures, and

TI  - PFAS on atmospheric aerosol particles: a review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent organic pollutants of concern to human health. These synthetic chemicals are in widespread use for consumer products, firefighting foams, and industrial applications. They have been detected all over the globe, including at remote locations distant from any possible point sources. One mechanism for long-range transport of PFAS is through sorption to aerosol particles in the atmosphere. PFAS can be transferred from the sea surface to sea spray aerosol particles through wave breaking and bubble bursting, and PFAS emitted to the atmosphere in the gas phase can sorb to particulate matter through gas-particle partitioning. Here we present a comprehensive review of global measurements of PFAS on ambient particulate matter dating back to the first reports from the early 2000s. We summarize findings for the historically important C8 species, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), including detection of isomers and size-segregated measurements, as well as studies of newer and emerging PFAS. We conclude that long-term monitoring of PFAS on particulate matter should be expanded to include more measurement sites in under-sampled regions of the world and that further non-targeted work to identify novel PFAS structures is needed as PFAS manufacturing and regulations continue to evolve.

TI  - Thermal processing reduces PFAS concentrations in blue food-A systematic review and meta-analysis star
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in the environment and often ingested with food. PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques.

TI  - Critical review on negative emerging contaminant removal efficiency of wastewater treatment systems: Concept, consistency and consequences
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Emerging contaminants (ECs) are not completely removed by wastewater treatment owing to their capabilities of making complexes, toxic derivatives, byproduct formation, and dynamic partitioning. Negative contaminant removal i.e., higher concentrations (up to 5731%) of these ECs in the effluent with respect to the influent sampled on the same occasions, is globally prevalent in almost all types of treatment systems. Conventional WWTPs showed the highest negative removal (NR) for Carbamazepine, and Carbadox. Conjugation-deconjugation, types of WWTPs, transformations, leaching, operational parameters, sampling schemes, and nature of substance governs the NR efficiencies. Among the various categories of micropollutants, pesticides and beta-blockers are reported to exhibit the maximum percentage of NR, posing threat to human and the environment. With > 200% of NR for beta-blockers, low blood-pressure related symptoms may likely to get more prevalent in the near future. Study red-flags this phenomenon of negative removal that needs urgent attention.

TI  - The potential of biochar-photocatalytic nanocomposites for removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Biochar (BC)-photocatalyst nanocomposites have emerged as appealing water and wastewater treatment technology. Such nanocomposite materials benefit from the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis to attain improved removal of pollutants from water and wastewater. Under this review, three BC-based nanocomposite photocatalysts such as BC-TiO2, BC-ZnO, and BC-spinel ferrites were considered. These nanocomposites acquire intrinsic properties to improve the practical limitations of the pristine BC and photocatalysts. The BC-based nanocomposites attained high photocatalytic activity, mechanical hardness, thermal stability, chemically non-reactive, magnetically permeable, reduced energy band gaps, improved reusability, and simplified recovery. Moreover, BC-based photocatalytic nanocomposites showed reduced recombination rates of the electron-hole pairs which are desirable for photocatalytic applications. However, the surface areas of the composites are usually smaller than that of the BC but higher than those of the pristine photocatalysts. Practically, the performances of the nanocomposites are much superior to those of the corresponding pristine components. This hybrid treatment technology is an emerging field and its industrial application is still at an early stage of the investigation. Therefore, exploring the full potential and practical applications of this technology is highly encouraging. Hence, this review focused on the critical evaluation of the most recent research on the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalytic treatment efficiency of the BC photocatalyst nanocomposites towards emerging pollutants in the aqueous medium. Moreover, the influence of various sources of BC feedstocks and their limitations on adsorption and photodegradation activities are discussed in detail. Finally, concluding remarks and future research directions are given to assist and shape the exploration of BC-based nanocomposite photocatalysts in water treatment.

TI  - Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants in the United States: Seasonal Patterns and Meta-Analysis of Long-Term Trends and Average Concentrations
T2  - ACS ES&T WATER
AB  - This paper presents an up-to-date meta-analysis assessing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) concentrations at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as changes over time. PFAS concentrations were compiled for WWTPs in the United States from peer-reviewed studies, technical reports, and original data. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased by an average of 6.0 +/- 1.6 ng/L from the influents to the effluents of WWTPs, but perfluorosulfonic add (PFOS) did not significantly change, indicating sorption to sludge is offset by biotransformation of precursor compounds. The occurrence of individual PFAS may vary temporally; for example, perfluoropentanoic add correlated weakly with seasonal temperatures at a site in Virginia. Wastewater effluent PFOA concentrations decreased at a site in Nevada from 2012 to February 2020 but appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effluent PFOA also declined nationally from 1999 to 2020 by similar to 13% per year. Nevertheless, the national mean PFOA concentration was 8.4 +/- 0.4 ng/L in data collected from 2013 to 2020 with outliers omitted, indicating persisting low-level occurrence. This would equate to 383 +/- 20 kg of PFOA per year continuing to enter the environment via WWTP effluents.

TI  - Mechanisms and pathways of PFAS degradation by advanced oxidation and reduction processes: A critical review
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the degradation of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by advanced oxidation or reduction processes. Howbeit, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C-C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems.

TI  - Layered Double Hydroxides as Rising-Star Adsorbents for Water Purification: A Brief Discussion
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Within the frame of this article, briefly but comprehensively, we present the existing knowledge, perspectives, and challenges for the utilization of Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) as adsorbents against a plethora of pollutants in aquatic matrixes. The use of LDHs as adsorbents was established by considering their significant physicochemical features, including their textural, structural, morphological, and chemical composition, as well as their method of synthesis, followed by their advantages and disadvantages as remediation media. The utilization of LDHs towards the adsorptive removal of dyes, metals, oxyanions, and emerging pollutants is critically reviewed, while all the reported kinds of interactions that gather the removal are collectively presented. Finally, future perspectives on the topic are discussed. It is expected that this discussion will encourage researchers in the area to seek new ideas for the design, development, and applications of novel LDHs-based nanomaterials as selective adsorbents, and hence to further explore the potential of their utilization also for analytic approaches to detect and monitor various pollutants.

TI  - Sonolysis of per- and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A meta-analysis
T2  - ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Human ingestion of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated food and water is linked to the development of several cancers, birth defects and other illnesses. The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 - 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 - 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H2 as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 - 40 mu M. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 - 500 kHz), concentration (> 15 - 40 mu M), temperature (asymptotic to 120 C), and pH range (3.2 - 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F- is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO(4)(2-)and CO2 by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g(-1) PFAS). It is concluded that sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a treatment train for improved efficiency.

TI  - Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a metaanalysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM.Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results.Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86-1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86-1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55-1.16) respectively.Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism.

TI  - Global patterns and temporal trends of perfluoroalkyl substances in municipal wastewater: A meta-analysis
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - Despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), continued human and ecological exposure to PFAS has led to concerns about historical releases. Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five per-fluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11% to 37% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.

TI  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water and wastewater: A critical review of their global occurrence and distribution
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of fluorinated organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L-1-mu g L-1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out-they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure-they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS.

TI  - Promising adsorptive materials derived from agricultural and industrial wastes for antibiotic removal: A comprehensive review
T2  - SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The development of novel materials and their application as adsorbents to improve water quality is one of the branches of materials science that has advanced significantly in the last decade. Due to the contamination of water resources with antibiotic residues, and the concern to contribute to the development of antibiotic resis-tance, scientists have tapped into agricultural and industrial wastes in order to transform them into new func-tional adsorbents that allow the adsorption of these pollutants. This review aims to summarize the different types of adsorptive materials that can be prepared using these residues and their application for removing antibiotics. From the reviewed literature, the adsorbents were classified as raw materials, surface-modified adsorbents, waste-based composites, carbon-based materials, and other adsorbents like zeolite, nano-hydroxyapatite, nano-cellulase, nano-silica, among others. Biochar and hydrochar are two of the most studied carbonaceous materials, with adsorption capacities ranging from 10 to 944 mg/g. Other leading adsorbents from the same family include mesoporous carbons, hierarchical and heteroatoms-doped porous carbons, and bio graphene, with surface area and adsorption performance over 1000 m(2)/g and 500 mg/g, respectively. The most outstanding material pre -pared from waste was zeolite analcime, produced from electrolytic manganese residue, removing 1922 mg/g for roxithromycin. In addition, new methodologies or combined methods to produce these adsorbents, including new modifier agents (ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents), templating, self-templating, doping techniques, and thermo-chemical approaches were reviewed for the first time. Furthermore, particular emphasis was given to photocatalyst-loaded adsorbents due to their synergistic effect of adsorption and degradation of antibiotics. Finally, novel methodologies to regenerate saturated adsorbents were discussed, such as UV radiation-assisted regeneration and ultrasound.

TI  - Marine sediment analysis-A review of advanced approaches and practices focused on contaminants
T2  - ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB  - This review is aimed at critical analysis of current and emerging capabilities of analytical methods as employed for marine sediment analysis. An emphasis is given to the most reliable experimental strategies used to quantifying the various classes of contaminants and thus to acquiring analytical information that is relevant to assess the quality of sediments with regard to possible pollution of marine ecosystems. Advanced analytical methodology in use basically relies on the application of mass spectrometry to enable identification and quantification of hazardous chemical species, directly or after separation using the principles of gas and liquid chromatography. Also addressed are sample preparation techniques which - given the complexity of sediment matrices and the diverse and multiple nature of contaminants - are often a key for successful analysis. Among the trends in marine sediment analysis is an inclination to chemicals that are only recently recognized as emerging pollutants of very high concern, such as microplastics, pharmaceuticals and their metabolites.

TI  - Detection and treatment strategies of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): Fate of PFAS through DPSIR framework analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB  - Per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), regarded as "forever chemicals", are a class of emerging contaminants occurring worldwide that pose many serious environmental issues to water quality and human health. The presence of strong carbon-fluorine bonds in their backbone and their physicochemical properties offer them resistance and restrict them from breaking down into simple compounds in the environment. There are many challenges to be addressed in the detection and removal from the environment. In this comprehensive review, a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been proposed to understand PFAS from the source of emission and their impacts on the environment. We reviewed the various detection methodologies for monitoring PFAS levels and analytical techniques for their quantification to know their environmental levels. The challenges and scope of various treatment technologies developed and implemented have also been critically discussed. The future perspectives of PFAS, including their source reduction and framing regulatory policies and the challenges faced when moving towards a sustainable future, are focused.

TI  - Oral exposure to a hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) disrupts mitochondrial function and biogenesis in mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) is reported to have hepatotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and cyto-toxicity. In this study, the toxicological effects of HFPO-TA on mitochondrial function and biogenesis were studied. Mice were exposed to drinking water which contained either 2, 20, or 200 mu g/L HFPO-TA. Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 mu g/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochon-drial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 mu g/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Furthermore, exposure to 200 mu g/L HFPO-TA significantly up-regulating mRNA and protein levels of Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Mff, but did not change Drp1. These findings suggest HFPO-TA could have detrimental effects on health of animals, particularly it was associated with disrupted mitochondrial energy metabolism.

TI  - Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in a multiethnic cohort
T2  - JHEP REPORTS
AB  - Background & Aims: Exposure to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of persistent organic pollutants, is ubiquitous. Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; > 55 lg/L) were associated with 4.5 -fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain a-keto acid), and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals " because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most common forms of liver cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues for helping to prevent this disease.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Molecular Gatekeeper Discovery: Workflow for Linking Multiple Exposure Biomarkers to Metabolomics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The exposome reflects multiple exposures across the life-course that can affect health. Metabolomics can reveal the underlying molecular basis linking exposures to health conditions.Here, we explore the concept and general data analysis frameworkof"molecular gatekeepers"???key metabolites that link single ormultiple exposure biomarkers with correlated clusters ofendogenous metabolites???to inform health-relevant biologicaltargets. We performed untargeted metabolomics on plasma from152 adolescent girls participating in the Growing Up HealthyStudy in New York City. We then performed network analysis tolink metabolites to exposure biomarkers includingfive traceelements (Cd, Mn, Pb, Se, and Hg) andfive perfluorinatedchemicals (PFCs; n-PFOS, Sm-PFOS, n-PFOA, PFHxS, andPFNA). We found 144 molecular gatekeepers and annotated 22 of them. Lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0) and taurodeoxycholatewere correlated with both n-PFOA and n-PFOS, suggesting a shared dysregulation from multiple xenobiotic exposures.Sphingomyelin (d18:2/14:0) was significantly associated with age at menarche; yet, no direct association was detected between anyexposure biomarkers and age at menarche. Thus, molecular gatekeepers can also discover molecular linkages between exposurebiomarkers and health outcomes that may otherwise be obscured by complex interactions in direct measurements

TI  - Critical review of technologies for the on-site treatment of hospital wastewater: From conventional to combined advanced processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - This review aims to assess different technologies for the on-site treatment of hospital wastewater (HWW) to remove pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) as sustances of emerging concern at a bench, pilot, and full scales from 2014 to 2020. Moreover, a rough characterisation of hospital effluents is presented. The main detected PhCs are antibiotics and psychiatric drugs, with concentrations up to 1.1 mg/L. On the one hand, regarding the presented technologies, membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a good alternative for treating HWW with PhCs removal values higher than 80% in removing analgesics, anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular drugs, and some antibiotics. Moreover, this system has been scaled up to the pilot plant scale. However, some target compounds are still present in the treated effluent, such as psychiatric and contrast media drugs and recalcitrant antibiotics (erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole). On the other hand, ozonation effectively removes antibiotics found in the HWW (>93%), and some studies are carried out at the pilot plant scale. Even though, some families, such as the X-ray contrast media, are recalcitrant to ozone. Other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as Fenton-like or UV treatments, seem very effective for removing pharmaceuticals, Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria (ARBs) and Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs). However, they are not implanted at pilot plant or full scale as they usually consider extra reactants such as ozone, iron, or UV-light, making the scale-up of the processes a challenging task to treat high-loading wastewater. Thus, several examples of biological wastewater treatment methods combined with AOPs have been proposed as the better strategy to treat HWW with high removal of PhCs (generally over 98%) and ARGs/ARBs (below the detection limit) and lower spending on reactants. However, it still requires further development and optimisation of the integrated processes.

TI  - Critical review on sustainable bioreactors for wastewater treatment and water reuse
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rapid developments are habitually connected with substantial wastewater production (sources- municipal, textile, landfill, digester reject, saline industry, tannery, greywater, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, coal gasification, etc.), which contains different pollutants like nitrogen, phosphorous, carbon, heavy metals, emerging pollutants (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptive compounds) and others. In this critical situation and rising water demand, biological techniques are the need of the hour for wastewater treatment and reuse, thereby protecting the environment. This paper highlights the most used bioreactors like Biofilter, Vermifiltration, MFC, MBBR, UASB, and MBR and their unique features. Additionally, details like intermediates, microbiology, operational conditions, mechanisms, implications, advantages, recent advancements, shortcomings, and removal efficiency of target pollutants (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous- CNP; emerging contaminants- pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptive compounds) were discussed. The traditional and advanced versions of those bioreactors were also emphasized. Moreover, the review highlights different case studies related to the reuse scope of treated water that must be addressed for upcoming expansions and large-scale application of biological techniques in water reuse and the further development of hybrid systems. MFC is a well-known treatment technology for removing pollutants from wastewater when undertaken on a small scale; however, attempts should be made to make it successful on a larger scale. In Vermifiltration, further attempts must to be conducted to develop and design of robust systems as earthworms are sensitive to temperature and moisture.

TI  - UV-filters in marine environments: a review of research trends, meta-analysis, and ecotoxicological impacts of 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor and benzophenone-3 on marine invertebrate communities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The potential adverse effects of UV-filter pollution in marine environments have been the focus of research in recent years. This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review. A critical discussion of the applications, regulatory aspects, and environmental occurrences of these selected compounds was provided. The present study also focused on the most recent (2015-2021) field and laboratory studies investigating the ecotoxicological impacts of 4-MBC and BP-3 on marine invertebrates. This review highlights the need for more research efforts to fill the knowledge gaps on the realistic effects these compounds may have when considered individually, in combination, or as subsequent exposures. Overall, this review aims to establish guidelines for further studies to understand the effect of UV-filters on marine ecosystems and marine invertebrate communities.

TI  - Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure and risk of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background Emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the etiology of diabetes. Objectives This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or beta and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. Results An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a "parabolic-shaped" association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with "low" risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered "moderate". Conclusions Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population. Reduced exposure to these "forever and everywhere chemicals" may be an important preventative approach to reducing the risk of diabetes across the population.

TI  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in consumable species and food products
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of thousands of manmade chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However, the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in this sense.

TI  - The effects of exposure to environmentally relevant PFAS concentrations for aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels: Systematic review and meta-analyses
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a collective name for approximately 4700 synthetic chemicals ubiquitous in the aquatic environment worldwide. They are used in a wide array of products and are found in living organisms around the world. Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 mu g/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies have been performed on secondary consumers and there is a substantial lack of studies on other consumers in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Subsurface Environments: Occurrence, Fate, Transport, and Research Prospect
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), also known as "forever chemicals," are manmade chemicals that have been increasingly detected in various geological settings since the early 2000s. The soil and subsurface environments are the geological media commonly affected by PFAS. We conducted a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 through 2022 concerning the fate and transport of PFAS in subsurface environments. This review is organized into different subsections, covering the basics of PFAS properties and how they affect the occurrence, fate, and transport of PFAS, the fundamental processes affecting subsurface transport and fate of PFAS, and mathematical models for describing and predicting PFAS transport behaviors. Mechanisms governing PFAS transport in the subsurface environment, including the sorption of PFAS at the air-water interface, solid-water interface, and nonaqueous phase liquids-water interface, were explored in detail. Challenges and future research priorities are identified to better mitigate the global challenges of PFAS contamination.

TI  - Aristolochic acid I as an emerging biogenic contaminant involved in chronic kidney diseases: A comprehensive review on exposure pathways, environmental health issues and future challenges
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Described in the 1950s, Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) has been recognized as a chronic kidney disease (CKD) with clinical peculiarities and multiple etiological factors. Environmental contaminants - aromatic compounds, mycotoxins and phytotoxins like aristolochic acids (AAs) - polluting food and drinking water sources, were incriminated in BEN, due to their nephrotoxic and carcinogenic properties. The implication of AAs in BEN etiology is currently a highly debated topic due to the fact that they are found within the Aristolochiaceae plants family, used around the globe as traditional medicine and they were also incriminated in Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy (AAN). Exposure pathways have been investigated, but it is unclear to what extent AAs are acting alone or in synergy with other cofactors (environmental, genetics) in triggering kidney damage. Experimental studies strengthen the hypothesis that AAI, the most studied compound in the AAs class, is a significant environmental contaminant and a most important causative factor of BEN. The aim of this review is to compile information about the natural exposure pathways to AAI, via traditional medicinal plants, soil, crop plants, water, food, air. Data that either supports or contradicts the AAI theory concerning BEN etiology was consolidated and available solutions to reduce human exposure were discussed. Because AAI is a phytotoxin with physicochemical properties that allow its transportation in environmental matrices from different types of areas (endemic, nonendemic), and induce CKDs (BEN, AAN) and urinary cancers through bioaccumulation, this review aims to shed a new light on this compound as a biogenic emerging pollutant.

TI  - Metal-organic frameworks as platforms for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from contaminated waters
T2  - MATTER
AB  - Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have received considerable attention due to their toxicity, ubiquitous presence, and recalcitrance in the environment. The manufacturing and disposal of PFAS-containing products has resulted in PFAS contamination of groundwater and drinking water supplies. Substantial interest and efforts in developing PFAS treatment technologies has been triggered since PFAS are associated with numerous adverse health effects. Physical separation using activated carbon and ion exchange is the most widely adopted technique for PFAS removal from contaminated water. However, both adsorbents generally exhibit low PFAS adsorption capacities and/or slow adsorption kinetics. The development of efficient adsorbents is of urgent need. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of hybrid crystalline nanoporous materials, which are composed of inorganic and organic building blocks to form multidimensional networks. Key features-tunable structures and high internal surface areas-render MOFs as ideal platforms for PFAS removal from aqueous environments. This review critically examines the application of MOFs for PFAS removal and highlights the structural features of MOFs in context of their PFAS removal performances. Factors affecting the adsorption efficiency, regeneration, and application for PFAS detection are extensively discussed while also providing important insights on design strategies for next-generation MOF materials with improved PFAS removal performances.

TI  - Current and future federal and state sampling guidance for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental matrices
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of emerging contaminants composed of an estimated 5000 to 10,000 human-made, fluorinated, organic chemicals. Due to the complexity of PFAS, the need for multiple environmental matrix considerations and the absence of a promulgated federal standard for environmental sampling and analysis, U.S. states have begun developing health-based regulatory and/or guidance values for a limited number of PFAS in environmental matrices. As there is a growing body of science to inform PFAS sampling guidance standard development, it is important to understand which U.S. states are implementing sampling guidelines and how they plan to handle emerging PFAS. This critical review discusses the current and impending federal and state sampling guidelines for PFAS in environmental matrices, the data gaps surrounding PFAS sampling guidance in U.S. states, and the future impacts of impending guidance documents and regulations. Ten federal guidance documents are available for PFAS sampling guidance and analysis. The maximum number of PFAS covered in these guidance documents is 25 analytes spanning across 8 unique media. While the EPA has developed several different sampling and analytical guidelines for PFAS, there is no formal regulation of PFAS or requirements of states to enforce these guidelines. As a result, only 31 states have informally adopted sampling guidelines, while the other 19 states have no guidance documentation in place for PFAS. The introduction of new PFAS sampling guidelines by the EPA, as well as updated analytical guidelines that target more PFAS or total organofluoride, is expected to continuously shift the landscape of federal and state guidance for PFAS sampling moving forward.

TI  - A Review on Removal and Destruction of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Novel Membranes
T2  - MEMBRANES
AB  - Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are anthropogenic chemicals consisting of thousands of individual species. PFAS consists of a fully or partly fluorinated carbon-fluorine bond, which is hard to break and requires a high amount of energy (536 kJ/mole). Resulting from their unique hydrophobic/oleophobic nature and their chemical and mechanical stability, they are highly resistant to thermal, chemical, and biological degradation. PFAS have been used extensively worldwide since the 1940s in various products such as non-stick household items, food-packaging, cosmetics, electronics, and firefighting foams. Exposure to PFAS may lead to health issues such as hormonal imbalances, a compromised immune system, cancer, fertility disorders, and adverse effects on fetal growth and learning ability in children. To date, very few novel membrane approaches have been reported effective in removing and destroying PFAS. Therefore, this article provides a critical review of PFAS treatment and removal approaches by membrane separation systems. We discuss recently reported novel and effective membrane techniques for PFAS separation and include a detailed discussion of parameters affecting PFAS membrane separation and destruction. Moreover, an estimation of cost analysis is also included for each treatment technology. Additionally, since the PFAS treatment technology is still growing, we have incorporated several future directions for efficient PFAS treatment.

TI  - Immunomodulation and exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: an overview of the current evidence from animal and human studies
T2  - ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been widely used and represent a class of environmental persistent chemicals. An association of a reduction of vaccination efficacy with PFAS serum levels in humans was used by the European Food Safety Authority as a key effect for PFAS risk assessment. The data support for using this association is reviewed by a critical analysis of the respective human epidemiology and the available animal studies on the immunomodulation of PFAS. Based on an analysis of the available human epidemiology, the overall level of evidence regarding associations between PFAS serum levels and reduced antibody response remains weak. Absence of an association between an increase in clinical infections and PFAS serum levels and the limited understanding of the importance of antibody levels as an isolated data point further support this conclusion. Animal toxicity studies with PFAS focusing on immunomodulation also provide only limited support for immunomodulation as an important endpoint in PFAS toxicity. While immunomodulation is observed after PFAS administration, generally at blood concentrations several orders of magnitude above those seen in environmentally exposed humans, the relevance of these observation is hampered by the high doses required to influence immune endpoints, the limited number of endpoints assessed, and inconsistent results. The limitations of the current database on associations of human PFAS exposures outlined here indicate that more evidence is required to select immunomodulation as a critical endpoint for human PFAS risk assessment.

TI  - Occupational exposure and serum levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): A review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a class of chemicals used in nearly all sectors of industry and many consumer products. Their resistance to degradation, however, means that PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate. PFAS exposure has also been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS production. MethodsA comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). ResultsOur analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent. ConclusionsResults highlight a need for additional research on occupational PFAS exposures and concomitant environmental exposures in these populations. Research on exposure levels in occupations and industries known or suspected to utilize PFAS is critically needed to foster informed recommendations for exposure mitigation measures to protect workers from adverse health effects of PFAS exposure.

TI  - Adsorption as a remediation technology for short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water - a critical review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Because of their ubiquitous presence in the environment and their potential toxicity to human health, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have drawn great attention over the past few years. Current conventional drinking and wastewater treatment approaches fail to effectively remove these substances from aqueous media, motivating researchers to focus on using sorption, a simple and cost-effective method, to remove PFAS from contaminated water. This work aims to summarize and critically evaluate the sorption capacities of PFAS by a variety of natural and engineered sorbents, including carbonaceous materials, ion exchange resins, polymers, different natural materials and other engineered sorbent materials. The specific focus of this review is on the performance of these different materials in removing short-chain PFAS due to their high solubility and mobility in aqueous media. A treatment train optimizing the removal of these short-chain substances from water is proposed, and challenges and future recommendations are discussed.

TI  - Removal of Toxic Pollutants from Industrial Effluent: Sustainable Approach and Recent Advances in Metal Organic Framework
T2  - INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
AB  - The water environment is mostly polluted by expanded industrial advancements and growth, which directly liberates various toxic pollutants into the water streams. These emerging pollutants cause several hazardous health issues to humans, animals, and the ecosystem. Conventional treatment methodology faces different issues in the recognition and removal of toxins, such as expense, facile operation conditions, and the prerequisite of high maintenance. To overcome this issue, adsorption is viewed as one of the most encouraging innovations for the removal of pollutants. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered to be efficiently adsorbent, because of their porosity, high surface area, fine-tunable metal clusters, and easy functional surface engineering properties. This Review concerns the recent examinations on MOFs as proficient material in the removal of toxic contaminants from wastewater. The adsorption mechanism of toxic pollutants removal using MOFs-based materials was critically reviewed and discussed. At last, challenges and the viewpoint for future advancement of MOFs is summarized.

TI  - Sources, occurrence, and treatment techniques of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in aqueous matrices: A comprehensive review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of synthetic organic pollutants, have prompted concerns about their global prevalence and possible health effects. This review consolidates the most recent data on different aspects of PFAS, such as their occurrence, and prominent sources. The current literature analysis of PFAS occurrence suggests significant variation in their concentration ranging from 0.025 to 1.2 x 10(8) ng/L in wastewater, 0.01 to 8.9 x 10(5) ng/L in surface water, and < 0.01 to 1.3 x 10(4) ng/L in groundwater globally. Since conventional treatment techniques are inadequate in remediating PFAS, innovative treatment approaches based on their removal or mineralization mechanism have been comprehensively reviewed. Advanced treatment technologies have shown degradation or removal of PFAS to be around 6 and > 99.9% in different aqueous matrices. However, due to significant drawbacks in their applicability in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a novel treatment train approach has emerged as an effective alternative. This approach synergistically integrates multiple remediation techniques while addressing the impediments of individual treatments. Furthermore, nanofiltration (NF270) combined with electrochemical degradation has been demonstrated to be the most efficient (> 98%) treatment train approach in PFAS remediation. If implemented in WWTPs, nanofiltration fol-lowed by adsorption using activated carbon is also a viable method for PFAS removal.

TI  - Neurotransmission Targets of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Neurotoxicity: Mechanisms and Potential Implications for Adverse Neurological Outcomes
T2  - CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of persistent environmental pollutants that are ubiquitously found in the environment and virtually in all living organisms, including humans. PFAS cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. Thus, PFAS are a likely risk for neurotoxicity. Studies that measured PFAS levels in the brains of humans, polar bears, and rats have demonstrated that some areas of the brain accumulate greater amounts of PFAS. Moreover, in humans, there is evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and an increased cause of death from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in elderly populations. Given possible links to neurological disease, critical analyses of possible mechanisms of neurotoxic action are necessary to advance the field. This paper critically reviews studies that investigated potential mechanistic causes for neurotoxicity including (1) a change in neurotransmitter levels, (2) dysfunction of synaptic calcium homeostasis, and (3) alteration of synaptic and neuronal protein expression and function. We found growing evidence that PFAS exposure causes neurotoxicity through the disruption of neurotransmission, particularly the dopamine and glutamate systems, which are implicated in age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated research has shown there are highly reproduced increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus and catecholamine levels in the hypothalamus and decreased dopamine in the whole brain after PFAS exposure. There are significant gaps in the literature relative to the assessment of the nigrostriatal system (striatum and ventral midbrain) among other regions associated with PFAS-associated neurologic dysfunction observed in humans. In conclusion, evidence suggests that PFAS may be neurotoxic and associated with chronic and age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies assess the impact of PFAS and PFAS mixtures on the mechanism of neurotransmission and the consequential functional effects.

TI  - Removal of Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) by Free Radicals in Advanced Oxidation Processes
T2  - MATERIALS
AB  - As emerging pollutants, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) have received extensive attention due to their high detection frequency (with concentrations ranging from ng/L to mu g/L) and potential risk to aqueous environments and human health. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective techniques for the removal of PPCPs from water environments. In AOPs, different types of free radicals (HO center dot, SO4 center dot(-), O-2 center dot(-), etc.) are generated to decompose PPCPs into non-toxic and small-molecule compounds, finally leading to the decomposition of PPCPs. This review systematically summarizes the features of various AOPs and the removal of PPCPs by different free radicals. The operation conditions and comprehensive performance of different types of free radicals are summarized, and the reaction mechanisms are further revealed. This review will provide a quick understanding of AOPs for later researchers.

TI  - Non-targeted metabolomics and associations with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in humans: A scoping review
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Objective: To summarize the application of non-targeted metabolomics in epidemiological studies that assessed metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure.
   Recent Findings: Eleven human studies published before April 1st, 2021 were identified through database searches (PubMed, Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus), and citation chaining (Citationchaser). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 40 to 965, involving children and adolescents (n = 3), nonpregnant adults (n = 5), or pregnant women (n = 3). High-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was the primary analytical platform to measure both PFAS and metabolome. PFAS were measured in either plasma (n = 6) or serum (n = 5), while metabolomic profiles were assessed using plasma (n = 6), serum (n = 4), or urine (n = 1). Four types of PFAS (perfluorooctane sulfonate (n = 11), perfluorooctanoic acid (n = 10), perfluorohexane sulfonate (n = 9), perfluorononanoic acid (n = 5)) and PFAS mixtures (n = 7) were the most studied. We found that alterations to tryptophan metabolism and the urea cycle were most reported PFAS-associated metabolomic signatures. Numerous lipid metabolites were also suggested to be associated with PFAS exposure, especially key metabolites in glycerophospholipid metabolism which is critical for biological membrane functions, and fatty acids and carnitines which are relevant to the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation. Other important metabolome changes reported included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regarding energy generation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in cellular energy systems.
   Conclusions: There is growing interest in using non-targeted metabolomics to study the human physiological changes associated with PFAS exposure. Multiple PFAS were reported to be associated with alterations in amino acid and lipid metabolism, but these results are driven by one predominant type of pathway analysis thus require further confirmation. Standardizing research methods and reporting are recommended to facilitate result comparison. Future studies should consider potential differences in study methodology, use of prospective design, and influence from confounding bias and measurement errors.

TI  - Official health communications are failing PFAS-contaminated communities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: Environmental health agencies are critical sources of information for communities affected by chemical contamination. Impacted residents and their healthcare providers often turn to federal and state agency webpages, fact sheets, and other documents to weigh exposure risks and interventions.
   Main body: This commentary briefly reviews scientific evidence concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) for health outcomes that concern members of affected communities and that have compelling or substantial yet differing degree of scientific evidence. It then features official documents in their own language to illustrate communication gaps, as well as divergence from scientific evidence and from best health communication practice. We found official health communications mostly do not distinguish between the needs of heavily contaminated communities characterized by high body burdens and the larger population with ubiquitous but substantially smaller exposures. Most health communications do not distinguish levels of evidence for health outcomes and overemphasize uncertainty, dismissing legitimate reasons for concern in affected communities. Critically, few emphasize helpful approaches to interventions. We also provide examples that can be templates for improvement.
   Conclusions: Immediate action should be undertaken to review and improve official health communications intended to inform the public and health providers about the risks of PFAS exposure and guide community and medical decisions.

TI  - Effects of exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on vaccine antibodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on epidemiological studies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Vaccines are essential for children to defend against infection. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available. Further studies are needed to validate the possible associations.

TI  - Evaluating the efficiency of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane processes for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from water: A critical review
T2  - SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been ubiquitously detected in the aquatic environment which poses a risk for human exposure. The recalcitrant behavior of PFAS to most traditional water treatment processes calls for development of novel or modified treatment approaches for effective PFAS elimination. Currently, highpressure membrane systems, including nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are among the most promising and readily applied technologies for PFAS removal. In this review, we summarized peer-reviewed scientific articles on the development and use of 20 different types of commercial and 6 synthesized/modified NF and RO membranes in terms of PFAS removal efficacy. Synthesizing of existing knowledge shows that under environmentally relevant pH and concentration, NF and RO can effectively remove PFAS from water. The impact of PFAS molecular weight (MW) and functionality, membrane characteristics, feed water constitution, natural organic matters and operational conditions were systematically reviewed and evaluated. Moving forward, we recommend additional research dedicated to understanding the behaviors of PFAS alternatives and other overlooked compounds (e.g., PFAS with chain length C2 and C3) during NF and RO processes. Further, it is critical to develop or optimize existing membrane products with strong selectivity for specific PFAS species, while being resistant to fouling. Overall, this review is expected to assist researchers and water quality managers investigating membrane processes for PFAS removal.

TI  - The PFAS-Tox Database: A systematic evidence map of health studies on 29 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: PFAS (per-and polyfluomalkyl substances) are a large class of synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. The scientific literature on PFAS has increased dramatically in the last decade. Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS.
   Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS.
   Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d) PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org.
   Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or more PFAS of interest. There were 505 human, 385 animal, and 220 in vitro studies. Summary tables of the extracted data and overall observations are included in this report.
   Conclusions: The PFAS-Tox Database is a useful tool for searching, filtering, and identifying peer reviewed research on the health and toxicological effects of the included PFAS. In this summary of the evidence map we provide examples of data gaps and clusters revealed by the database, with the goal of helping direct future research efforts, facilitate systematic reviews (e.g. on immune effects, mixtures of PFAS, or effects of short chain PFAS), inform regulatory risk assessments, and improve opportunities for cross-disciplinary coordination. We also discuss how this tool supports scientists, regulatory agencies, and other individuals by increasing awareness and access to current evidence regarding the health effects associated with PFAS exposure.

TI  - Systematic Evidence Map for Over One Hundred and Fifty Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS.
   OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of similar to 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing.
   METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement-only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epi-demiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioas-say studies with >= 21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata.
   RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evi-dence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams.
   DISCUSSION: Many of the similar to 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures.

TI  - Associations between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and birth outcomes: A meta-analysis
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Although previous meta-analyses have shown that prenatal PFASs exposure is associated with reduction in birth weight, effects of prenatal PFASs exposure on birth outcomes have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta analysis of 23 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science before March 21, 2021 to analyze the association between prenatal PFASs exposure and birth outcomes, including premature birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and miscarriage. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding confidence intervals were extracted for analysis. According to the heterogeneity of the included studies, fixed effects (I-2 <= 50%) and random-effects (I-2 > 50%) models were applied respectively. The significant associations between PFOS and PTB (pooled OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.20-1.98), PFOA and miscarriage (pooled OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15-1.70), and PFOS and LBW (pooled OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19-1.94) were obtained. There were differences between included studies with different study regions, sampling time, and samples type used for PFASs assessment. These findings may provide insight in risk assessment and decision-making in producing products that contain PFASs.

TI  - Effects of PFOA on the physicochemical properties of anaerobic granular sludge: Performance evaluation, microbial community and metagenomic analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The impact of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on the anaerobic granular sludge was evaluated through a sequential batch experiment. Results showed that PFOA inhibited the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of the sludge and the dosage of 100 mg/L PFOA was more obvious. However, this negative effect would gradually weaken with the adaptation of microorganisms. For the 50 mg/L PFOA experimental group, the proteins content in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the anaerobic granular sludge increased from 1.53 mg/g to 3.65 mg/g. Meanwhile, PFOA inhibited the 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride (INT) activity of the anaerobic granular sludge. Furthermore, 100 mg/L PFOA reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria by 5.99% and Longilinea by 1.11%. 100 mg/L PFOA mainly restricted COD removal by affecting the glycolysis process, with the abundances of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase reduced by 8% and 28.1%, respectively. Compared with the control group, the relative abundance of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit increased by 84%, respectively, under 100 mg/L PFOA.

TI  - Human Evidence of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposure on Hepatic Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used throughout different industries, including the food industry, because it is resistant to heat and prevents water or oil from easily permeating into or contaminating materials coated by PFOA. Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086-1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects.

TI  - Recent advances in the synthesis and environmental catalytic applications of layered double hydroxides-based materials for degradation of emerging pollutants through advanced oxidation processes
T2  - MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB  - Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), one of the most important 2D heterostructure materials, have provided massive improvements for various applications in many fields. Especially, their application in water treatment as efficient catalysts owing to their unique features such as tunable structure, excellent thermal stability and regeneration performances. LDHs represent an eco-friendly alternative to conventional catalysts especially for the degradation of noxious emerging contaminants in aqueous solution. They have the ability to host anions in their interlayer structure and the particularity of having a memory effect which facilitates the phenomena of regeneration. Thus, this paper discusses the available knowledge about the synthesis of LDHs and their derivative catalysts, and the factors affecting in AOPs for the removal of emerging compounds. Incontestably, LDHs and LDH-based materials possess an exceptional flexible structure with adsorption ability and catalytic activity, which allows them to be extensively employed in the environmental remediation of emerging contaminants in water.

TI  - Critical analysis of the performance of pilot and industrial scale technologies for sewage reuse
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Wastewater reuse is a relevant strategy for confronting water scarcity. Several technologies have been proposed for water reclamation, but only some of them have been successfully implemented at real scale. Against this backdrop, the present review aims to compare the performance of the main technologies that have been implemented at pilot and industrial scale for sewage reuse. In order to do so, we conducted a search for scientific articles in Web of Science, using different search strings and focusing exclusively in studies at pilot and industrial scale. A bibliometric analysis of the retrieved works was performed, followed by a critical review of their main findings regarding the removal efficiency of regulated and emerging pollutants, and their compliance with in-ternational reuse guidelines. The bibliometric analysis suggests that public policies promoting wastewater reuse is a relevant driver behind the research and development of water reclamation technologies, and shows that most of the published research has been oriented towards technical assessments, with less reports dealing with social issues. Many of the identified processes show significant removals of conventionally regulated pollutants, and allow to meet the quality standards of international guidelines. Among those, membrane technologies present significant and consistent removal of several contaminants. However, the removal of organic micropollutants remains an important challenge for reuse technologies, and the importance of identifying and optimizing the operational conditions necessary to provide an efficient, safe, and consistent removal, both in terms of the presence of the aforementioned contaminants and challenges such as antibiotic resistant microorganisms, is emphasized.

TI  - Dermal uptake: An important pathway of human exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been produced and used in a broad range of products since the 1950s. This class, comprising of thousands of chemicals, have been used in many different products ranging from firefighting foam to personal care products and clothes. Even at relatively low levels of exposure, PFAS have been linked to various health effects in humans such as lower birth weight, increased serum cholesterol levels, and reduced antibody response to vaccination. Human biomonitoring data demonstrates ubiquitous exposure to PFAS across all age groups. This has been attributed to PFAS-contaminated water and dietary intake, as well as inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust for adults and toddlers. In utero exposure and breast milk have been indicated as important exposure pathways for foetuses and nursing infants. More recently, PFAS have been identified in a wide range of products, many of which come in contact with skin (e.g., cosmetics and fabrics). Despite this, few studies have evaluated dermal uptake as a possible route for human exposure and little is known about the dermal absorption potential of different PFAS. This article critically investigates the current state-of-knowledge on human exposure to PFAS, highlighting the lack of dermal exposure data. Additionally, the different approaches for dermal uptake assessment studies are discussed and the available literature on human dermal absorption of PFAS is critically reviewed and compared to other halogenated contaminants, e.g., brominated flame retardants and its implications for dermal exposure to PFAS. Finally, the urgent need for dermal permeation and uptake studies for a wide range of PFAS and their precursors is highlighted and recommendations for future research to advance the current understanding of human dermal exposure to PFAS are discussed.

TI  - Microplastics in Freshwater Environment in Asia: A Systematic Scientific Review
T2  - WATER
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging pollutant in the aquatic environment, and this has gradually been recognized in the Asian region. This systematic review study, using the Scopus database, provides an insightful understanding of the spatial distribution of scientific studies on MPs in freshwater conducted across the Asian region, utilized sampling methods, and a detailed assessment of the effects of MPs on different biotic components in freshwater ecosystems, with special focus on its potential risks on human health. The results of this review indicate that research on microplastics in Asia has gained attention since 2014, with a significant increase in the number of studies in 2018, and the number of scientific studies quadrupled in 2021 compared to 2018. Results indicated that despite a significant amount of research has been conducted in many Asian countries, they were not distributed evenly, as multiple studies selected specific rivers and lakes. Additionally, around two-thirds of all the papers focused their studies in China, followed by India and South Korea. It was also found that most of the studies focused primarily on reporting the occurrence levels of MPs in freshwater systems, such as water and sediments, and aquatic organisms, with a lack of studies investigating the human intake of MPs and their potential risks to human health. Notably, comparing the results is a challenge because diverse sampling, separation, and identification methods were applied to estimate MPs. This review study suggests that further research on the dynamics and transport of microplastics in biota and humans is needed, as Asia is a major consumer of seafood products and contributes significantly to the generation of plastic litter in the marine environment. Moreover, this review study revealed that only a few studies extended their discussions to policies and governance aspects of MPs. This implies the need for further research on policy and governance frameworks to address this emerging water pollutant more holistically.

TI  - A comprehensive review on the removal of antibiotics from water and wastewater using carbon nanotubes: synthesis, performance, and future challenges
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Recently, various emerging pollutants have been detected in water and wastewater, among which antibiotics can be considered a real threat to human life and environment because of their unique properties (bio-accumulation, bio-magnification, resistance, and bio-transformation). Therefore, it is urgent to apply methods for the detection and removal of these pollutants. Given that antibiotics cannot be completely removed by conventional methods, developing alternative methods to enhance their removal efficiency should be the focus of researchers. Over the past decades, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained considerable attention owing to their remarkable merits (high surface area, low density and high thermal conductivity). However, despite the numerous advantages of CNTs, they suffer from some limitations, which can be solved by surface modification. Hence, this comprehensive review aims to help readers to improve their fundamental knowledge regarding the main characteristics of common antibiotics and their environmental and health effects, their fate in the environment, common methods for their removal, physicochemical methods for the modification of CNTs, identifying the effects of various parameters (pH, dosage, initial concentration, and time) on the removal process, and the reusability and major mechanism for the adsorption of antibiotics by CNTs. Finally, we summarize the isotherm and kinetic models for the removal of antibiotics. Our results exhibit that all the data fitted the Langmuir isotherm model, which reveals that the adsorption process on modified-CNTs is homogenous and monolayer. Furthermore, herein, the adsorption kinetics is well described by the pseudo-second-order model. Overall, this review provides useful insight for young researchers to understand the adsorption of antibiotics and achieve the future goal of using CNTs as promising adsorbents.

TI  - Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid exposure altered hypothalamic metabolism and disturbed male fecundity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Previous studies have examined the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) on disruption of the blood-testis barrier and spermatogenesis. Sertoli and Leydig cells were perturbed, resulting in a decrease in testosterone levels and sperm counts. However, the effects of PFOS on male fecundity are not limited to the testes. In this study, we dem-onstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 mu g/g BW and 5 mu g/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular tran-scriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Altogether, the activation of brain nuclei, shift of hypothalamic metabolome, and reduction of LH/LHr circuit resulted from PFOS exposure suggested the toxicant's systematic effects on male reproduction.

TI  - What Happens In Utero Does Not Stay In Utero: a Review of Evidence for Prenatal Epigenetic Programming by Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Infants, Children, and Adolescents
T2  - CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Review human literature on the relationship between prenatal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and epigenetic modifications in infants, children, and adolescents < 18 years of age. Recent Findings Eleven studies were identified, with study populations located in the U.S., Taiwan, Japan, and the Kingdom of Denmark. Many studies (n = 5) were cross-sectional, with PFAS exposure and epigenetic outcomes measured in the same tissue collected at delivery via cord blood or dried newborn blood spots. The other six studies were prospective, with prenatal PFAS measured on maternal blood during pregnancy and DNA methylation (DNAm) assessed in cord blood and childhood peripheral leukocytes (n = 1 study). Epigenetic marks of interest included global DNAm measures (LINE-1, Alu, and an ELISA-based method), candidate genes (IFG2, H19, and MEST), and epigenome-wide DNA methylation via array-based methods (Infinium 450 K and EPIC). Two studies using array-based methods employed discovery and validation paradigms, in which a small subset of loci (n = 6 and n = 4) were replicated in the discovery population. One site (TNXB) was a hit in two independent studies. Collectively, loci associated with PFAS were in regions involved in growth and development, lipid metabolism, and nutrient metabolism. There is moderate human evidence supporting associations of prenatal PFAS exposure on DNAm at birth, with one study suggesting sustained effects into childhood. Future studies are warranted to link PFAS-associated DNAm to health outcomes, as well as to investigate the role of other epigenetic marks such as hydroxymethylation, miRNA expression, and histone modifications.

TI  - Plastic pollution in the environment in Nigeria: A rapid systematic review of the sources, distribution, research gaps and policy needs
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Plastic are emerging pollutants requiring urgent intervention for its management. In African countries like Nigeria, the evidence to inform plastic pollution management is scanty. This rapid review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence on the distribution, sources, biological effects, research gaps and policy needs of plastic pollution in various environmental matrices in Nigeria. Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, mesoand macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) ( n = 12), macroplastics ( n = 12) or both ( n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land. Only 15 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had any data on micro- and/or macroplastics. Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments. Microplastic data in biota were limited to selected fish species, aquatic insects and gastropods. Only one (1) study on plastics in waterbodies in Northern Nigeria (Kogi State) was found. Research gaps on plastic distribution in terrestrial biota, other aquatic biota, soil, air, ground and potable water sources as well as biological effects were identified. Policy needs for plastic pollution management identified include stakeholder education, polymer replacement, recycling, tax and incentives to support the sustainability of life below water and on land (UN SDGs 14 and 15).

TI  - A critical review of the application of polymer of low concern regulatory criteria to fluoropolymers II: Fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fluoropolymers are a distinct class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), high molecular weight (MW) polymers with fluorine attached to their carbon-only backbone. Fluoropolymers possess a unique combination of properties and unmatched functional performance critical to the products and manufacturing processes they enable and are irreplaceable in many uses. Fluoropolymers have documented safety profiles; are thermally, biologically, and chemically stable, negligibly soluble in water, nonmobile, nonbioavailable, nonbioaccumulative, and nontoxic. Although fluoropolymers fit the PFAS structural definition, they have very different physical, chemical, environmental, and toxicological properties when compared with other PFAS. This study describes the composition, uses, performance properties, and functionalities of 14 fluoropolymers, including fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers, and presents data to demonstrate that they satisfy the widely accepted polymer hazard assessment criteria to be considered polymers of low concern (PLC). The PLC criteria include physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, which determine bioavailability and warn of potential hazard. Fluoropolymers are insoluble (e.g., water, octanol) solids too large to migrate into the cell membrane making them nonbioavailable, and therefore, of low concern from a human and environmental health standpoint. Further, the study results demonstrate that fluoropolymers are a distinct and different group of PFAS and should not be grouped with other PFAS for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. When combined with an earlier publication by Henry et al., this study demonstrates that commercial fluoropolymers are available from the seven participating companies that meet the criteria to be considered PLC, which represent approximately 96% of the global commercial fluoropolymer market.

TI  - Barriers and Promotors to Health Service Utilization for Pelvic Floor Disorders in the United States: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Qualitative and Quantitative Studies
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
AB  - Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), such as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal incontinence (AI), and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), affect approximately 1 in 4 women in the United States. Many women endure PFD symptoms without seeking care. The Andersen's health behavior model explains health service utilization (HSU) using 4 domains: (1) individual needs for care, (2) resources or enabling factors, (3) predisposing factors, and (4) macrostructural/contextual factors. This study aims to apply this model to PFDs to determine the rate of HSUs in American women experiencing PFDs. The secondary objective was to examine HSU behavior using a variation of Andersen's model: the authors limited outcome variables to that of accessing PFD health services by any health care provider. As the normal Andersen's health behavior model covers broad personal health practices and general health behavior, this modification allowed for increased precision of individual predictors and relevance to urogynecology.
   Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, the authors conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed, using search terms relevant to PFDs (in addition to disparities in care access). Included were studies of community-dwelling PFD symptomatic women living in the United States and quantitative and qualitative studies with primary and/or secondary aims addressing care-seeking or HSU behavior. For this study, PFDs were defined as AI, LUTSs, and POP. Extracted data were as follows: first author's last name, study aim, year of publication, study population geographic location, study participant demographics, PFD types, insurance, number of care-seekers and/or non-care-seekers, participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, body mass index, general health status, language used in study, symptoms, and other barriers and/or promotors identified.
   Overall, 44 publications were found that met the criteria of the study. Of these, 36 were quantitative, 5 were qualitative, and 3 were mixed-methods studies. The predominant focus of these studies was LUTSs (33/44 studies), whereas only 2 were on POP, 5 onmultiple PFDs, and 4 onAI. More than half were publishedmore than a decade ago (25/44), and themajority were based on self-reporting to national surveys. Women with symptomatic PFDs exhibited a 37% pooled prevalence of HSU, with determinants identified across the first 3 domains in the model only (macrostructural domains associated with HSU were not identified).
   For the first domain, quantitative studies demonstrated that PFD symptom severity and duration and preexisting depression were individual care needs associated with greater HSU behavior. Consistent with the quantitative data available in this study, qualitative data also demonstrated that facilitators of HSU were (1) longer symptom duration and (2) negative impact of PFD on quality of life.
   For the resources domain, established primary or secondary care and social support/networks increased HSU behaviors, but (oddly) higher income and employment were barriers to care. Of note, home remedy utilization was identified as a barrier to HSU in this category (taking of herbal supplements, use of diapers, and other self-management strategies).
   Predisposing factors noted to increase HSU in this study were age older than 50 years. Minority women were not well represented in this analysis, but notably, Asian women were significantly less likely to demonstrate HSU related to PFD. Qualitatively, there were no differences in socioeconomic status of women who did or did not show HSU, but the most common facilitator was awareness of PFD treatments, and common barriers included misinformation and normalization of pelvic floor symptoms.
   Limitations of this study include the possibility of missed publications with relevance (such as articles involving interstitial cystitis, sexual dysfunction, birth trauma, and others, as they are important aspects of PFDs). However, the team focused on studies related to common PFDs and their HSU, as opposed to peripheral analyses or pelvic floor conditions. Second, the study may be limited by using counts of themes and numbers of reporting studies in the overall qualitative analysis. Finally, significant heterogeneity in the studies indicates caution should be used in interpreting the operating room and pooled HSU rate for each identified determinant.
   The study indicates that designing inclusive interventions, building upon previous research frameworks, and addressing multilayered factors are all required for improving care-seeking rates of women with PFDs. To mitigate the glaring inequity in the United States of access to pelvic floor care, the authors recommend research focused on HSU for patients with POP or AI, implementation of multifaceted interventions, and investigations into macrostructural factors affecting HSU.

TI  - A Participatory Science Approach to Evaluating Factors Associated with the Occurrence of Metals and PFAS in Guatemala City Tap Water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Limited information is available regarding chemical water quality at the tap in Guatemala City, preventing individuals, water utilities, and public health authorities from making data-driven decisions related to water quality. To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1-64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider. Overall, the high prevalence of arsenic above the MPL in Guatemala City tap water represents a potential health risk that current water treatment processes are not optimized to remove. Furthermore, potential contaminants from premise plumbing and storage, including lead and PFAS, represent additional risks requiring further investigation and public engagement.

TI  - Rate of C8 Radiculopathy in Patients Undergoing Cervicothoracic Osteotomy: A Systematic Appraisal of the Literature
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of C8 radiculopathy is a known complication following cervicothoracic osteotomies. However, the clinical profile of C8 radiculopathy is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of C8 radiculopathy after cervicothoracic osteotomies and to form a clinical profile describing the characteristics through a systematic review of the literature.
   METHODS: An electronic database search for full-text English articles was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The search yielded results on indications for cervicothoracic osteotomies, surgical approaches, mean follow-up time, and significant complications, including C8 radiculopathy.
   RESULTS: Our literature search yielded 2135 articles, of which 12 qualified to be included in the analysis. The 12 articles comprised 451 patients undergoing various osteotomy approaches. The mean age of subjects was 51.0 years (range, 11.4-63.2 years), and the majority of patients were male (66%, n = 298). Ankylosing spondylitis was the most frequent indication for surgery (44.8%, n = 202). The number of patients with postoperative C8 radiculopathy was found to decrease over time (1997 -2020) by showing statistical significance (r = -0.65, P = 0.021).
   CONCLUSIONS: Of the 451 patients included in this study, 53 had C8 radiculopathy (11.8% of the total patient population). Moreover, the rate of C8 radiculopathy decreased over time in a statistically significant manner. An understanding of the factors associated with the incidence of C8 radiculopathy is essential for future improvement of patient outcomes.

TI  - Uncovering PFAS and Other Xenobiotics in the Dark Metabolome Using Ion Mobility Spectrometry, Mass Defect Analysis, and Machine Learning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The identification of xenobiotics in nontargeted metabolomic analyses is a vital step in understanding human exposure. Xenobiotic metabolism, transformation, excretion, and coexistence with other endogenous molecules, however, greatly complicate the interpretation of features detected in nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites from xenobiotics is also often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS), mass defect filtering, and machine learning to uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species in large metabolomic feature lists. Xenobiotic classes examined included those of known high toxicities, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pesticides. Specifically, when the workflow was applied to identify PFAS in the NIST SRM 1957 and 909c human serum samples, it greatly reduced the hundreds of detected liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-MS features by utilizing both mass defect filtering and m/z versus IMS collision cross sections relationships. These potential PFAS features were then compared to the EPA CompTox entries, and while some matched within specific m/z tolerances, there were still many unknowns illustrating the importance of nontargeted studies for detecting new molecules with known chemical characteristics. Additionally, this workflow can also be utilized to evaluate other xenobiotics and enable more confident annotations from nontargeted studies.

TI  - Muscle activation, strength, and volume in people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE
AB  - Objective: This systematic review investigated whether people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) have muscle strength, volume, and activation around the hip and knee that is different from asymptomatic controls.
   Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain.
   Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = -1.34 to -0.57), hip external rotation (-0.55;-1.07 to -0.03), hip extension (-0.72;-1.16 to -0.28), and knee extension (-0.97;-1.41 to -0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls. People with PFOA also presented with smaller volumes of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris when compared to asymptomatic controls. Also, people with PFOA presented with changes in muscle activation for the VL, VM and gluteus maximus (GMax) when compared to asymptomatic controls.
   Conclusion: People with PFOA present with lower strength and volume of the hip and quadriceps muscles and altered muscle activation of the VM, VL and GMax during ascending and descending stairs when compared to asymptomatic controls. However, the certainty of these findings are very low. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

TI  - Does the Contractile Capability of Pelvic Floor Muscles Improve with Knowledge Acquisition and Verbal Instructions in Healthy Women? A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Seventy percent of women with pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) are estimated to present deficient consciousness of their pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) and poor ability to contract them. Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs. Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women considered healthy or with mild symptoms that may be indicative of PFDs.

T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The effects of PFOA on the nitrogen removal performance, microbial community and functional genes of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) sludge in an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) were investigated. The removal efficiencies of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrite (NO2--N) decreased from 93.90 +/- 3.64% and 98.6 +/- 1.84% to 77.81 +/- 6.86% and 77.96 & PLUSMN; 1.88% when PFOA increased from 5 mg/L to 50 mg/L, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis of the anammox sludge showed the presence of both C-F and CaF2 forms of F. Metagenomics analysis of the anammox sludge in the first compartment illustrated that the relative abundance of Ca.Brocadia and Ca.Kuenenia decreased from 22.21% and 5.61% to 2.11% and 2.84% at 50 mg/L PFOA compared with that without PFOA. In addition, the nitrogen metabolism pathway showed that adding 50 mg/L PFOA decreased the expression of HzsB, HzsC, and Hdh (anammox genes) by 0.096%, 0.05% and 0.062%, respectively.

TI  - Critical Review of Thermal Decomposition of Per- andPolyfluoroalkyl Substances: Mechanisms and Implications forThermal Treatment Processes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) arefluorinated organic chemicals that are concerning due to theirenvironmental persistence and adverse human and ecological effects.Remediation of environmental PFAS contamination and their presencein consumer products have led to the production of solid and liquidwaste streams containing high concentrations of PFASs, which requireefficient and cost-effective treatment solutions. PFASs are challenging todefluorinate by conventional and advanced destructive treatmentprocesses, and physical separation processes produce waste streams(e.g., membrane concentrate, spent activated carbon) requiring furtherpost-treatment. Incineration and other thermal treatment processes arewidely available, but their use in managing PFAS-containing wastesremains poorly understood. Under specific operating conditions, thermal treatment is expected to mineralize PFASs, but thedegradation mechanisms and pathways are unknown. In this review, we critically evaluate the thermal decomposition mechanisms,pathways, and byproducts of PFASs that are crucial to the design and operation of thermal treatment processes. We highlight theanalytical capabilities and challenges and identify research gaps which limit the current understanding of safely applying thermaltreatment to destroy PFASs as a viable end-of-life treatment process.

TI  - The human fecal microbiome contributes to the biotransformation of the PFAS surfactant 8:2 monosubstituted polyfluoroalkyl phosphate ester
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB  - Polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) can be found throughout society due to their numerous commercial applications. However, they also pose an environmental and health concern given their ability to undergo hydrolysis and oxidation to several bioactive and persistent products, including the perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The metabolism of PAPs has been shown to occur in mammalian liver and intestine, however metabolism by the gut microbiome has not yet been investigated. In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis. Metabolites of interest were the immediate hydrolysis product, the 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), and 11 additional metabolites previously shown to form from 8:2 FTOH in both oxic and anoxic environments. The kinetics of 8:2 monoPAP transformation by gut microbiota were compared to those in human S9 liver and intestine fractions, both of which have active levels of hydrolyzing and oxidative enzymes that transform 8:2 monoPAP. Transformation rates from 8:2 monoPAP to 8:2 FTOH were highest in liver S9 > intestine S9 > fecal suspensions. The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone approximate to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation.

TI  - Autoimmune disorders of platelet function: systematic review of cases of acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia and acquired delta storage pool disease
T2  - BLOOD TRANSFUSION
AB  - Acquired platelet function disorders (PFD) are rare bleeding diseases that should be suspected in all patients with unexplained mucocutaneous bleedings of recent onset, with no previous history of haemorrhages, and with normal coagulation test and platelet count. Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrornbasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet alpha llb beta 3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (a delta SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatrnent of the under lying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.
   Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and a delta SPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening diseases.

TI  - Effect of conservative treatment of pelvic floor dysfunctions in women: An umbrella review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - Objective Due to their high worldwide prevalence, pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD's) are a public health problem. There is high heterogeneity in the types and effectiveness of conservative treatment. The objective was to analyze the scientific evidence on conservative treatment of PFDs in women. Methods Umbrella review, covering MEDLINE (1950-2019), Scopus (1960-2019), Web of Science (1980-2019), and Cochrane Library (2000-2019). Inclusion criterion: review on conservative treatments about pelvic floor disorders in the adult women, in Spanish or English; exclusion criterion: studies about other urological, gynecological, and coloproctological pathologies, among others. Results Thirty-two reviews (2000-2019) and 12 meta-analyses were included. 53.1% showed an improvement on urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training worked on 70.6% of them, followed by electrical stimulation and estrogen (11.7%), and weight loss (5.9%). 6.3% of reviews and meta-analyses fulfilled all items in PRISMA, and 93.7% of them fulfilled more than 60% of the checklist. 60% de los items. Conclusions PFMT and weight loss are the most effective treatments for UI, but there is no evidence for other PFDs. The methodological quality of conservative treatments must be improved for a more effective treatment of PFDs in women. Pelvic floor muscle training and weight loss are the most effective treatments for urinary incontinence. Only the 6.3% of the review fulfilled all PRISMA items.

TI  - Microplastics and adsorbed micropollutants as emerging contaminants in landfill: A mini review
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & HEALTH
AB  - Landfills are the hub of numerous kinds of contaminants. Plastic dumping in landfills around the world is considered a global concern considering environmental and human health risks. The landfill environmental condition accelerates the disintegration of plastics that ultimately turned into the emerging contaminant, microplastics (MPs). MPs disseminate in the peripheral environmental matrices through runoff and leachate leakage. Besides, MPs have the affinity for both organic and inorganic micropollutants to adsorb on their sur-face and assist in the amplification of many emergent micro-organic (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) and inorganic (e.g., heavy metals) pollutants. This mini-review conducts a literature review on the current publications on MPs in landfills and their contribution to emergent micropollutants in landfill sites.

TI  - Nano/Microplastics Capture and Degradation by Autonomous Nano/Microrobots: A Perspective
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB  - The growing use of plastic materials has led to the continuous accumulation of wastes in marine environments, which fragment into hazardous micro-and nanoplastics. These plastic particles absorb toxic organic pollutants on their surface, support bacterial biofilms growth, and propagate through the food chain, posing serious risks for human health. Therefore, nano/microplastics pollution has become a global issue, making their definitive elimination compulsory. Self-propelled nano/microrobots have demonstrated efficient removal of nano/microplastics from water, combining enhanced physicochemical properties of nano/microscale materials and active motion. During the last year, the potential of this technology to degrade nano/microplastics has been investigated. Here, the most advanced strategies for nano/microplastics capture and subsequent degradation by autonomous nano/microrobots are critically reviewed. A short introduction to the main propulsion mechanisms and experimental techniques for studying nano/microplastics degradation is also provided. Forthcoming challenges in this research field are discussed proactively. This perspective inspires future nano/microrobotic designs and approaches for water purification from nano/microplastics and other emerging pollutants.

TI  - Interaction and combined toxicity of microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in aquatic environment
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are recognized as vectors for the transport of organic contaminants in aquatic environments in addition to their own adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely present in aquatic environments due to their widespread applications, and thus coexist with MPs. Therefore, we focus on the interaction of MPs and PFASs and related combined toxicity in aquatic environments in this work. The adsorption of PFASs on MPs is critically reviewed, and new mechanisms such as halogen bonding, pi-pi interaction, cation-pi interactions, and micelle formation are proposed. Moreover, the effect of MPs on the transport and transformation of PFASs in aquatic environments is discussed. Based on four typical aquatic organisms (shellfish, Daphnia, algae, and fish), the toxicity of MPs and/or PFASs at the organismal or molecular levels is also evaluated and summarized. Finally, challenges and research perspectives are proposed, and the roles of the shapes and aging process of MPs on PFAS biogeochemical processes and toxicity, especially on PFAS substitutes, are recommended for further investigation. This review provides a better understanding of the interactions and toxic effects of coexisting MPs and PFASs in aquatic environments. (C) The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Exposure to persistent organic pollutants alters the serum metabolome in non-obese diabetic mice
T2  - METABOLOMICS
AB  - Introduction Autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) are believed to be caused by the interplay between several genetic and environmental factors. Elucidation of the role of environmental factors in metabolic and immune dysfunction leading to autoimmune disease is not yet well characterized. Objectives Here we investigated the impact of exposure to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the metabolome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an experimental model of T1D. The mixture contained organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Methods Analysis of molecular lipids (lipidomics) and bile acids in serum samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-Q-TOF/MS. Results Experimental exposure to the POP mixture in these mice led to several metabolic changes, which were similar to those previously reported as associated with PFAS exposure, as well as risk of T1D in human studies. This included an increase in the levels of sugar derivatives, triacylglycerols and lithocholic acid, and a decrease in long chain fatty acids and several lipid classes, including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. Conclusion Taken together, our study demonstrates that exposure to POPs results in an altered metabolic signature previously associated with autoimmunity.

TI  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), poly-brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I-2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests.
   Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis.
   Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.

TI  - Moulded pulp fibers for disposable food packaging: A state-of-the-art review
T2  - FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE
AB  - The paper provides a comprehensive review of moulded pulp production, properties and advantages over singleuse plastics and bioplastics for food packaging. Bagasse, wheat and bamboo are replacing wood as the fiber sources due to their cost effectiveness, wide availability and rapid renewability. Non-wood pulping and thermoforming processes have also advanced greatly which lead to improved fiber recovery, production efficiency and product quality. Challenges include lengthy production cycles, high chemical and energy uses, competition from bioplastics, and presence of toxic per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The industry is evolving rapidly to overcome these challenges including new laminated dry thermoforming processes, natural additives, customized fiber mixes, and PFAS-free products. Life-cycle assessments and provision of clear, viable green waste and recycling pathways relative to plastic alternatives are still needed to establish and maintain the competitiveness of cellulosic bioproducts with plastics. Critical research areas are proposed.

TI  - Assessment of endocrine disruptive properties of PFOS: EFSA/ECHA guidance case study utilising AOP networks and alternative methods
T2  - EFSA JOURNAL
AB  - Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are chemical substances that interfere with the endocrine system, adversely affecting human health and environment. Legislation with aim to eliminate and ban EDs have been introduced in EU, but the identification of EDs remains challenging and crucial step towards regulation and risk management. A guidance for ED assessment has been recently established for pesticides and biocides in the EU, which heavily relies on traditional toxicological testing in vivo. Most notably lacking mechanistic methods for some ED modalities and not covering many other modalities that might be affected by EDs. In this project, we focus on the ED assessment according to the valid legislation and explore the possibility to employ alternative methods to bolster the mechanistic understanding of the ED effects and eventually decrease the need for in vivo testing. We selected a well-studied industrial chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to be a model compound in a case study for ED assessment where the EU criteria were applied in the frame of human health risk assessment with focus on thyroid disruption and developmental neurotoxicity. A systematic literature review has been conducted for these effects (Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), and relevant studies were selected by title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. Selected studies were assessed for reliability (SciRAP), and all relevant data were extracted into a database and assessed by Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach. The initial analysis showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria. The use of mechanistic and alternative methods enhanced the outcomes of WoE assessment. Also, the study provides a great hands-on experience with the most up-to-date development in the area of risk assessment and EDs.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and thyroid function in neonates: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted 13 regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (13 coefficient,-0.022; 95% CI,-0.04 to-0.003) and PFAS (13 coefficient,-0.017; 95% CI,-0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.

TI  - Impact of Contaminants on Microbiota: Linking the Gut-Brain Axis with Neurotoxicity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut-brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota-gut-brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity.

TI  - Distribution and transport of atmospheric microplastics and the environmental impacts: A review
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB  - As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed in water, soil and atmosphere, and have become a popularly concerned environmental and social issue. The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs' potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m(-2) d(-1) or 0 to 1583 n m(-3). The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs' shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What's noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs' transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs' environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts.
   It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common and devastating injuries, especially for the elderly. Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single-screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris hip score and intra-operative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported.
   Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with a mean age of 77 years and 64% of patients being female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13-0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09-0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34-0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris hip score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, while no difference in operating times was observed between the two devices.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) is clinically more effective when compared to a single-screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris hip score. Intra-operative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures.

TI  - Hydrogenation of Carbon Dioxide to Value-Added Liquid Fuels and Aromatics over Fe-Based Catalysts Based on the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Route
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - Hydrogenation of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels not only effectively alleviates climate change but also reduces over-dependence on fossil fuels. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the chemical conversion of CO2 to value-added products, such as liquid fuels and aromatics. Recently, efficient catalysts have been developed to face the challenge of the chemical inertness of CO2 and the difficulty of C-C coupling. Considering the lack of a detailed summary on hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) route, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of the research progress on the development of efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics. In this work, we summarized the factors influencing the catalytic activity and stability of various catalysts, the strategies for optimizing catalytic performance and product distribution, the effects of reaction conditions on catalytic performance, and possible reaction mechanisms for CO2 hydrogenation via the FTS route. Furthermore, we also provided an overview of the challenges and opportunities for future research associated with hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics.

TI  - Electrocatalytic Oxidation Processes for Treatment of Halogenated Organic Pollutants in Aqueous Solution: A Critical Review
T2  - ACS ES&T ENGINEERING
AB  - Halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) are a class of organic substances that are difficult to degrade, easily bioaccumulate, and are stable in the environment. Compared with biological, physical, and chemical methods, electrocatalytic oxidation technology has the advantages of a strong oxidation ability, high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and high automation. The direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxidation processes are discussed. The generation processes and properties of oxidative species in indirect electrochemical oxidation processes, including hydroxyl radicals, active chlorine, sulfate radicals, O-3, H2O2, carbonate radicals, and O-1(2), are summarized. The cell designs involved in the flow-by, flow-through, and three-dimensional configurations are outlined. The removal ratios, intermediate products, and electrocatalytic oxidation mechanisms of halogenated pollutants, including perfluorinated, polyfluorinated, chlorinated, brominated, and iodinated organic compounds, are reviewed. The oxidative and mineralization ability, detoxification ability, and energy consumptions of electrocatalytic oxidation compared with other technologies are comprehensively evaluated. This Review are intended to introduce some effective strategies for lowering energy consumption in electrocatalytic oxidation processes. Finally, the current deficiencies and development trends in electrocatalytic oxidation are discussed.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review for Removal of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Attained from Wastewater Observations Using Carbon-Based Anodic Oxidation Process
T2  - TOXICS
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (concentration <mu g/L) are globally acknowledged as hazardous emerging pollutants that pass via various routes in the environment and ultimately enter aquatic food chains. In this context, the article reviews the occurrence, transport, fate, and electrochemical removal of some selected NSAIDs (diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NPX)) using carbon-based anodes in the aquatic environment. However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992-27,061 mu g/L (influent wastewater) and 1208-7943 mu g/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4-89%, 8-100%, 16-100%, and 17-98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81-95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94-98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs. However, boron-doped diamond and graphite have presented reliable applications for the complete removal of NSAIDs from wastewater samples or their aqueous solution.

TI  - Persistent organic pollutants and beta-cell toxicity: a comprehensive review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM
AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a diverse family of contaminants that show widespread global dispersion and bioaccumulation. Humans are continuously exposed to POPs through diet, air particles, and household and commercial products; POPs are consistently detected in human tissues, including the pancreas. Epidemiological studies show a modest but consistent correlation between exposure to POPs and increased diabetes risk. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of epidemiological evidence and an in-depth evaluation of the in vivo and in vitro evidence that POPs cause beta-cell toxicity. We review evidence for six classes of POPs: dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The available data provide convincing evidence implicating POPs as a contributing factor driving impaired glucose homeostasis, beta-cell dysfunction, and altered metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in islets. These findings support epidemiological data showing that POPs increase diabetes risk and emphasize the need to consider the endocrine pancreas in toxicity assessments. Our review also highlights significant gaps in the literature assessing islet-specific endpoints after both in vivo and in vitro POP exposure. In addition, most rodent studies do not consider the impact of biological sex or secondary metabolic stressors in mediating the effects of POPs on glucose homeostasis and beta-cell function. We discuss key gaps and limitations that should be assessed in future studies.

TI  - Genomics-based identification of a potential causal role for acylcarnitine metabolism in depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Altered metabolism of acylcarnitines - transporting fatty acids to mitochondria - may link cellular energy dysfunction to depression. We examined the potential causal role of acylcarnitine metabolism in depression by leveraging genomics and Mendelian randomization. Methods: Summary statistics were obtained from large GWAS: the Fenland Study (N = 9363), and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (246,363 depression cases and 561,190 controls). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses tested the potential causal link of 15 endogenous acylcarnitines with depression. Results: In univariable analyses, genetically-predicted lower levels of short-chain acylcarnitines C2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.95-1.00) and C3 (OR 0.97, 95%CIs 0.96-0.99) and higher levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines C8 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.01-1.06) and C10 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02-1.06) were associated with increased depression risk. No reverse potential causal role of depression genetic liability on acylcarnitines levels was found. Multivariable analyses showed that the association with depression was driven by the medium-chain acylcarnitines C8 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02-1.06) and C10 (OR 1.04, 95%CIs 1.02-1.06), suggesting a potential causal role in the risk of depression. Causal estimates for C8 (OR = 1.05, 95%CIs = 1.02-1.07) and C10 (OR = 1.05, 95%CIs = 1.02-1.08) were confirmed in follow-up analyses using genetic instruments derived from a GWAS meta-analysis including up to 16,841 samples. Discussion: Accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines is a signature of inborn errors of fatty acid metabolism and age-related metabolic conditions. Our findings point to a link between altered mitochondrial energy production and depression pathogenesis. Acylcarnitine metabolism represents a promising access point for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for depression.

TI  - Epigenetics at the Intersection of COVID-19 Risk and Environmental Chemical Exposures
T2  - CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Several environmental contaminants have been implicated as contributors to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Immunomodulation and epigenetic regulation have been hypothesized as mediators of this relationship, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are not well-characterized. This review examines the evidence for epigenetic modification at the intersection of COVID-19 and environmental chemical exposures. Recent Findings Numerous environmental contaminants including air pollutants, toxic metal(loid)s, per- and polyfluorinated substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk of severe COVID-19, but few studies currently exist. Drawing on evidence that many environmental chemicals alter the epigenetic regulation of key immunity genes and pathways, we discuss how exposures likely perturb host antiviral responses. Specific mechanisms vary by contaminant but include general immunomodulation as well as regulation of viral entry and recognition, inflammation, and immunologic memory pathways, among others. Associations between environmental contaminants and COVID-19 are likely mediated, in part, by epigenetic regulation of key immune pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Anaerobic Microbial Dechlorination of 6:2 Chlorinated Polyfluorooctane Ether Sulfonate and the Underlying Mechanisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The microbial transformation potential of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) was explored in anaerobic microbial systems. Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 ClPFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness research on proximal femoral nail versus dynamic hip screw in patients with trochanteric fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
AB  - Background The treatments for trochanteric fractures try to regain early mobility and limit morbidity and risk of reoperations. The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. Methods PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. Results From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery. Conclusions PFN(A) resulted in a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss compared to DHS. However, no difference was seen for postoperative complications.

TI  - Identifying environmental factors that influence immune response to SARS-CoV-2: Systematic evidence map protocol
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: Widespread environmental contamination can directly interact with human immune system functions. Environmental effects on the immune system may influence human susceptibility to respiratory infections as well as the severity of infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). Furthermore, the efficacy of vaccines to respiratory diseases may be impacted by environmental exposures through immune perturbations. Given the quick pace of research about COVID-19 and associated risk factors, it is critical to identify and curate the streams of evidence quickly and effectively.Objective: We developed this systematic evidence map protocol to identify and organize existing human and animal literature on high-priority environmental chemical classes (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, phthalates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and air pollutants) and their potential to influence three key outcomes: (1) susceptibility to respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV-2 (2) severity of the resultant disease progression, and (3) impact on vaccine efficacy. The result of this project will be an online, interactive database which will show what evidence is currently available between involuntary exposures to select environmental chemicals and immune health effects, data gaps that require further research, and data rich areas that may support further analysis. Search and study eligibility: We will search PubMed for epidemiological or toxicological literature on select toxicants from each of the chemical classes and each of the three outcomes listed above. Study appraisal and synthesis of methods: For each study, two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening as well as full text review for data extraction of study characteristics. Study quality will not be evaluated in this evidence mapping. The main findings from the systematic evidence map will be visualized using a publicly available and interactive database hosted on Tableau Public.

TI  - Insights into the mechanisms of organic pollutant toxicity to earthworms: Advances and perspectives*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Earthworms play positive ecological roles in soil formation, structure, and fertility, environmental protection, and terrestrial food chains. For this review, we searched the Web of Science database for articles published from 2011 to 2021 using the keywords "toxic" and "earthworm" and retrieved 632 publications. From the perspective of bibliometric analysis, we conducted a co-occurrence network analysis using the keywords "toxic" and "earthworm" to identify the most and least reported topics. "Eisenia fetida," "bioaccumulation," "heavy metals," "oxidative stress," and "pesticides" were the most common terms, and "microbial community," "bacteria," "PFOS," "bioaugmentation," "potentially toxic elements," "celomic fluid," "neurotoxicity," "joint toxicity," "apoptosis," and "nanoparticles" were uncommon terms. Additionally, in this review we highlight the main routes of organic pollutant entry into soil, and discuss the adverse effects on the soil ecosystem. We then systematically review the mechanisms underlying organic pollutant toxicity to earthworms, including oxidative stress, energy and lipid metabolism disturbances, neurological toxicity, intestinal inflammation and injury, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and reproductive toxicity. We conclude by discussing future research perspectives, focusing on environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions, novel data processing approaches, technologies, and detoxification and mitigation methods. This review has implications for soil management in the context of environmental pollution.

TI  - Metabolomics and Type 2 Diabetes Risk: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies
T2  - DIABETES CARE
AB  - BACKGROUNDDue to the rapidly increasing availability of metabolomics data in prospective studies, an update of the meta evidence on metabolomics and type 2 diabetes risk is warranted. PURPOSETo conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of plasma, serum, and urine metabolite markers and incident type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCESWe searched PubMed and Embase until 6 March 2021. STUDY SELECTIONWe selected prospective observational studies where investigators used high-throughput techniques to investigate the relationship between plasma, serum, or urine metabolites and incident type 2 diabetes. DATA EXTRACTIONBaseline metabolites per-SD risk estimates and 95% CIs for incident type 2 diabetes were extracted from all eligible studies. DATA SYNTHESISA total of 61 reports with 71,196 participants and 11,771 type 2 diabetes cases/events were included in the updated review. Meta-analysis was performed for 412 metabolites, of which 123 were statistically significantly associated (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05) with type 2 diabetes risk. Higher plasma and serum levels of certain amino acids (branched-chain, aromatic, alanine, glutamate, lysine, and methionine), carbohydrates and energy-related metabolites (mannose, trehalose, and pyruvate), acylcarnitines (C4-DC, C4-OH, C5, C5-OH, and C8:1), the majority of glycerolipids (di- and triacylglycerols), (lyso)phosphatidylethanolamines, and ceramides included in meta-analysis were associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 1.07-2.58). Higher levels of glycine, glutamine, betaine, indolepropionate, and (lyso)phosphatidylcholines were associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk (hazard ratio 0.69-0.90). LIMITATIONSSubstantial heterogeneity (I-2 > 50%, tau(2) > 0.1) was observed for some of the metabolites. CONCLUSIONSSeveral plasma and serum metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, are associated with type 2 diabetes risk.

TI  - Conducting evaluations of evidence that are transparent, timely and can lead to health-protective actions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: In February 2021, over one hundred scientists and policy experts participated in a web-based Workshop to discuss the ways that divergent evaluations of evidence and scientific uncertainties are used to delay timely protection of human health and the environment from exposures to hazardous agents. The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of "actionable evidence, " that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents. The recommendations are applicable to policy and regulatory settings at the local, state, federal and international levels.

TI  - Patient-reported outcome measures for pain in women with pelvic floor disorders: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction and hypothesis Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are helpful instruments when measuring and reporting changes in patient health status (Al Sayah et al. J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions.
   Methods We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality.
   Results From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs.
   Conclusions The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI. This knowledge may inform and assist in the development of a new PROM to be implemented into the APFPR.

Among threats to this taxonomic group, marine pollution might represent an additional concern for their survival. In this review, a comprehensive systematic search of scientific literature on pollutants in filter feeding elasmobranchs was conducted to evaluate the bioaccumulation patterns, and risk for human consumers. We found that, despite an increasing trend in the number of published studies, the geographical coverage is still very limited and most of the studies focused solely on trace elements (70.8%). Among sharks, Rhincodon typus was the most represented species (66.7%), while Mobula mobular the most studied ray species (41.7%). Comparing the levels of pollutants in filter feeders between ocean basins, this review highlighted that Hg, As and Cd levels are mostly higher in those areas affected by both strong natural and anthropogenic source of emissions, such as the Indian Ocean. With regards to OCs, SPCB levels in muscle of C. maximus were between 4.3 and 50.5 mu g kg(-1) ww, highlighting a persistent contamination of PCB in the Mediterranean Sea. Some species exceeded the maximum allowable limits for foodstuff consumption for As, Cd and Pb. A total of 77.8% of the analyzed species exceeded the Environmental Quality Standards for Hg, while they were always below the EQS(biota) for HCB, PBDEs, PFOS and DDT. Given their feeding mechanism that continuously samples the marine environment, further investigations are urgently needed to determine not only the extent of contaminant exposure in different hotspot locations but also the risks posed to the elasmobranch health.

TI  - Chemical Diversity of Flavan-3-Ols in Grape Seeds: Modulating Factors and Quality Requirements
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Grape seeds are a rich source of flavan-3-ol monomers, oligomers, and polymers. The diverse profile of compounds includes mainly B-type procyanidins (especially C4 -> C8 linked molecules) and the key monomers, catechin, and epicatechin that are positively implicated in the 'French Paradox'. Today grape seed nutraceuticals have become a multi-million-dollar industry. This has created incentives to elucidate the variations in chemistry across cultivars, to identify signs of adulteration, and to understand the intrinsic and extrinsic factors controlling the expression of metabolites in the seeds' metabolome. This review provides a critical overview of the existing literature on grape seed chemistry. Although the biosynthetic pathways for polymeric procyanidins in seeds have not yet been explained, abiotic factors have been shown to modulate associated genes. Research of extrinsic factors has demonstrated that the control of procyanidin expression is strongly influenced, in order of importance, by genotype (species first, then variety) and environment, as claimed anecdotally. Unfortunately, research outcomes on the effects of abiotic factors have low certainty, because effects can be specific to genotype or variety, and there is limited control over physical metrics in the field. Thus, to gain a fuller understanding of the effects of abiotic factors and biosynthetic pathways, and realise potential for optimisation, a more fundamental research approach is needed. Nevertheless, the current synthesis offers insight into the selection of species or varieties according to the profile of polyphenols, as well as for optimisation of horticultural practices, with a view to produce products that contain the compounds that support health claims.

TI  - Specific Metabolites Involved in Antioxidation and Mitochondrial Function Are Correlated With Frailty in Elderly Men
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundAs an age-related syndrome, frailty may play a central role in poor health among older adults. Sarcopenia overlaps with the physical domain of frailty, and most existing studies have analyzed the associated factors of frailty and sarcopenia as an isolated state. Perturbations in metabolism may play an important role in the presence of frailty or sarcopenia; however, the metabolites associated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines, as specific panels, are significantly correlated with frailty, especially overlapping with sarcopenia, to gain insight into potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms and to facilitate their management. MethodsWe applied a targeted high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach in serum samples from 246 Chinese older men (age 79.2 +/- 7.8 years) with frailty (n = 150), non-frailty (n = 96), frailty and sarcopenia (n = 52), non-frail and non-sarcopenic control (n = 85). Frailty was evaluated using Freid phenotype criteria, sarcopenia was defined by diagnostic algorithm of Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the participants were diagnosed as frailty and sarcopenia when they met the evaluation criteria of both frailty and sarcopenia. A panel of 29 metabolomic profiles was assayed and included different classes of amino acids, carnitines, acylcarnitines, and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to screen the metabolic factors contributing to frailty status, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore important factors and distinguish different groups. ResultsIn older men demonstrating the frail phenotype, amino acid perturbations included lower tryptophan and higher glycine levels. With regard to lipid metabolism, the frailty phenotype was characterized by lower concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine (C5), LPC16:0 and LPC18:2, while higher levels of octanoyl-L-carnitine (C8), decanoyl-L-carnitine (C10), dodecanoyl-L-carnitine (C12) and tetradecanoyl-L-carnitine (C14). After adjusting for several clinical confounders, tryptophan, LPC18:2, LPC 16:0 and C5 were negatively correlated with frailty, and C8 and C12 were positively related to frailty. We preliminarily identified metabolic profiles (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, glycine and tryptophan) that may distinguish older men with frailty from those without frailty. Importantly, a set of serum amino acids and LPCs (LPC16:0, LPC18:2, and tryptophan) was characterized in the metabotype of older adults with an overlap of frailty and sarcopenia. The metabolites that were most discriminating of frailty status implied that the underlying mechanism might be involved in antioxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. ConclusionsThese present metabolic analyses may provide valuable information on the potential biomarkers and possible biological mechanisms of frailty, and overlapping sarcopenia. The findings obtained may offer insight into their management in older adults.

TI  - The Role of Focal Approach as Alternative to Nephron- Sparing Surgery in the Treatment of Stage I Cancer in Renal Graft: Results of a Systematic Review
T2  - TURK ONKOLOJI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB  - In patients with kidney graft neoplasms, the treatment of choice is still represented by surgical approach, mainly based on partial nephrectomy/nephron sparing surgery (NSS). In this oncologic setting, focal treatments (FT) are becoming more and more useful to avoid the risk of dialysis, considering graft viability of utmost importance. There is still little evidence on which is the best FT option in kidney graft neoplasms and on its therapeutic indications. We performed a systematic review to assess the role of FT such as thermal ablation, interventional radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy, as alternative to NSS in the treatment of Stage I kidney cancer. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2010 and 2020 focusing on kidney transplant recipients with kidney graft neoplasm who had undergone FT. The review is framed by the population, intervention, control, and outcomes criteria. The studies underlined safety and efficacy of FT, with low morbidity and good graft survival, but none of them provided a direct comparison with graft nephrectomy or NSS. There is still no clear evidence that FTs, and percutaneous ones in particular, are indicated as a standard treatment in kidney graft neoplasms as opposed to total or partial graft nephrectomy.

TI  - Cell-Cell Interaction-Mediated Signaling in the Testis Induces Reproductive Dysfunction-Lesson from the Toxicant/Pharmaceutical Models
T2  - CELLS
AB  - Emerging evidence has shown that cell-cell interactions between testicular cells, in particular at the Sertoli cell-cell and Sertoli-germ cell interface, are crucial to support spermatogenesis. The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplasmic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations.

TI  - Metatranscriptomic Analysis of the Chicken Gut Resistome Response to In-Feed Antibiotics and Natural Feed Additives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The emergence of resistance against common antibiotics in the gut microbiota is a major issue for both human and livestock health. This highlights the need for understanding the impact of such application on the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in poultry gut and devising means to circumvent the potential resistome expansion. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are potential natural alternative to antibiotic to improve animal health and performance, supposedly via positively affecting the gut microbial ecosystem, but there is little systematic information available. In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups. In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of phytogenic feed additives could be an alternative to antibiotics in poultry farming, with the added benefit of counteracting antimicrobial resistance development.

TI  - Chemicals/materials of emerging concern in farmlands: sources, crop uptake and potential human health risks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB  - Certain chemicals/materials that are contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have been widely detected in water bodies and terrestrial systems worldwide while other CECs occur at undetectable concentrations. The primary sources of CECs in farmlands are agricultural inputs, such as wastewater, biosolids, sewage sludge, and agricultural mulching films. The percent increase in cropland area during 1950-2016 was 30 and the rise in land use for food crops during 1960-2018 was 100-500%, implying that there could be a significant CEC burden in farmlands in the future. In fact, the alarming concentrations (mu g kg(-1)) of certain CECs such as PBDEs, PAEs, and PFOS that occur in farmlands are 383, 35 400 and 483, respectively. Also, metal nanoparticles are reported even at the mg kg(-1) level. Chronic root accumulation followed by translocation of CECs into plants results in their detectable concentrations in the final plant produce. Thus, there is a continuous flow of CECs from farmlands to agricultural produce, causing a serious threat to the terrestrial food chain. Consequently, CECs find their way to the human body directly through CEC-laden plant produce or indirectly via the meat of grazing animals. Thus, human health could be at the most critical risk since several CECs have been shown to cause cancers, disruption of endocrine and cognitive systems, maternal-foetal transfer, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity. Overall, this comprehensive review provides updated information on contamination of chemicals/materials of concern in farmlands globally, sources for their entry, uptake by crop plants, and their likely impact on the terrestrial food chain and human health.

TI  - Genomic Characterization of Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov., a Biofilm-Forming Fungus Isolated from Mars 2020 Assembly Facility
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - A fungal strain (FJII-L10-SW-P1) was isolated from the Mars 2020 spacecraft assembly facility and exhibited biofilm formation on spacecraft-qualified Teflon surfaces. The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis.

TI  - Targeted metabolomics analysis of amino acids and acylcarnitines as risk markers for diabetes by LC-MS/MS technique
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Diabetes is a common chronic disease affecting millions of people worldwide. It underlies various complications and imposes many costs on individuals and society. Discovering early diagnostic biomarkers takes excellent insight into preventive plans and the best use of interventions. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the level of amino acids and acylcarnitines and diabetes to develop diabetes predictive models. Using the targeted LC-MS/MS technique, we analyzed fasting plasma samples of 206 cases and 206 controls that were matched by age, sex, and BMI. The association between metabolites and diabetes was evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and lipid profile. To deal with multiple comparisons, factor analysis was used. Participants' average age and BMI were 61.6 years, 28.9 kg/m(2), and 55% were female. After adjustment, Factor 3 (tyrosine, valine, leucine, methionine, tryptophan, phenylalanine), 5 (C3DC, C5, C5OH, C5:1), 6 (C14OH, C16OH, C18OH, C18:1OH), 8 (C2, C4OH, C8:1), 10 (alanine, proline) and 11 (glutamic acid, C18:2OH) were positively associated with diabetes. Inline, factor 9 (C4DC, serine, glycine, threonine) and 12 (citrulline, ornithine) showed a reverse trend. Some amino acids and acylcarnitines were found as potential risk markers for diabetes incidents that reflected the disturbances in the several metabolic pathways among the diabetic population and could be targeted to prevent, diagnose, and treat diabetes.

TI  - A review of atmospheric fine particulate matters: chemical composition, source identification and their variations in Beijing
T2  - ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major air pollutant worldwide. Characterizing its chemical compositions and source contributions is a critical prerequisite for effective control of PM2.5 pollution. This paper systematically reviews the sampling methods, chemical compositions, and source apportionments of PM2.5. Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004-2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. Future research on the impacts of these external factors is urgently needed. This review is expected to provide valuable advice and evidence for those fast-growing megacities like Beijing to identify and control their PM2.5-related air pollution problems.

TI  - Emerging contaminants in biosolids: Presence, fate and analytical techniques
T2  - EMERGING CONTAMINANTS
AB  - Emerging contaminants (ECs) represent a small fraction of the large chemical pollution puzzle where a wide variety of potentially hazardous chemicals reach the environment, and new compounds are continuously synthesized and released in wastewater treatment plants and ultimately in effluent and biosolids. ECs have been classified into various categories; however, this article focuses on the fate of major categories, namely pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), flame retardants, surfactants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and micro -plastics (MPs). These ECs when discharged to sewer and downstream wastewater treatment plants can undergo further transformations and either degrade, persist or convert into by-products which have the potential in some cases to be more hazardous. Because of potential dangerous impacts of the availability of these contaminants in the environment, information on the fate and behavior of these pollutants is highly important to develop new strategies, such as the regulation of chemicals imported into Australia and Australian consumer goods and environmental policies to mitigate them in a sustainable way. Moreover, advanced technologies are required for the detection and identification of novel contaminants emerging in the environment at ultra low levels. The application of chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectroscopy has provided attractive breakthroughs to detect new emerging contaminants. However, it is crucially important to understand the sensitivity and robustness of these analytical techniques when dealing with complex matrices such as biosolids. In addition, most of the literature was focused on selected compounds or a family of compounds and the existing reviews have paid less attention to examine the formation of metabolites during the wastewater treatment process and their impacts on the ecosystem. This review presents an overview of the presence of different classes of ECs around the world, their quantification from different sources like wastewater (influents or effluents), sludge and biosolids. In addition, the transformation of ECs during the treatment process, the formation of intermediate products and their impacts on the environment are also critically discussed. Three major steps of ECs analysis include sample preparation, extraction and clean-up, and analysis; hence, different methods employed for extraction and clean-up, and analytical techniques for identification are thor-oughly discussed, their advantages and limitations are also highlighted. This comprehensive review article is believed to enhance the understanding of ECs in sewage sludge and would be useful to the readers of the relevant communities and various stakeholders to investigate potential technologies to maximize destruction of ECs.

TI  - Activation of mycelial defense mechanisms in the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus induced by Tyrophagus putrescentiae
T2  - FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Fungal chemicals are vital in processes recognizing damage-and microbe-associated molecules (DAMPs/MAMPs) that trigger defense responses in fungi. Pleurotus ostreatus is a widely cultivated edible fungus that is prone to attack from fungivorous insects and mites. Yet P. ostreatus has evolved an elegant defense system against fun-givore attacks. In this study, we investigated how the oyster mushroom responds to the fungivory and me-chanical wounding by conducting transcriptome, proteome, and secondary metabolic analyses. The profiling analysis revealed a total of 11,495 transcripts and 866 proteins, 4416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 62 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in response to the mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae feeding and mechanical wounding. In comparing the responses induced by mechanical wounding, some genes, proteins, and metabolites were uniquely induced or repressed by the mite. At the transcript level, nine pathways were activated by the mite feeding, including those of "MAPK signaling pathway-yeast", "Phenylalanine metabolism", and "Biotin metabolism", among others, while both enrichment of "Ribosome", "Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes", and "Regulation of Mitophagy in Yeast" demonstrated the common effects upon fungal secretory protein synthesis and processing induced by fungivory and mechanical wounding. Fungivory also stimulated the synthesis of C8-aryl compounds and sesquiterpenes (especially1-octen-3-ol and alpha-/beta-bisabolene), and these compounds repellent to T. putrescentiae. Both jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) were specifically regulated by mite feeding and mechanical wounding. The terpene synthase gene transcription was significantly increased induced by the exogenous addition of MeJA, resulting in defensive sesquiterpene production against the mite. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/MAPK signaling pathway, JA regulation, specific gene expression, and protein synthesis, and anti -mite substance metabolism are all involved in coordinated inducible chemical-based defense responses in P. ostreatus, which could be especially effective the mite T. putrescentiae.

TI  - Different Metabolomic and Proteomic Profiles of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Ventricular and Lumbar Compartments in Relation to Leptomeningeal Metastases
T2  - METABOLITES
AB  - The different molecular profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between ventricular and lumbar compartments remain elusive, especially in the context of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), which affects CSF flow. We evaluated CSF metabolomic and proteomic profiles based on the compartments and the diagnosis of spinal LM, proved by MRI from 20 paired ventricular and lumbar CSF samples of LM patients, including 12 spinal LM (+) samples. In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified-7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (-) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (-) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment.

TI  - Synthetic strategies and performance of catalysts for pyrolytic production of alternative aviation fuels using non-edible lipids: A critical review
T2  - APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL
AB  - Non-edible lipids are an alternative source of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, particularly aviation fuels. As a transformation pathway, the catalytic pyrolysis of lipids can remove oxygen atoms and modify molecular structures via carbon chain cracking and aromatisation. However, this pathway has not yet been certified for the production of alternative aviation fuels. Therefore, a detailed review of various heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lipids into hydrocarbon fuels with molecular weights and structures suitable for use in aviation is presented herein, with a focus on aspects such as their physical and chemical properties, pore distributions and structures, active sites, key functions, catalytic performance, and pyrolysis mechanisms. Metal oxides can effectively remove oxygen atoms, whereas zeolites can achieve long-carbon-chain cracking to yield desirable gasoline-, kerosene-, or diesel-range fuels. Moreover, zeolites typically permit aromatisation, which yields the aromatic hydrocarbons required for liquid fuels. Modification of the pore structures of zeolites to yield hierarchical pores can improve the production of C8-C16-range liquid fuels to maximise the bio-kerosene yield. Therefore, composite catalysts (metal oxides supported on zeolites with hierarchical pores) can be effective for molecular-level structural modification in the pyrolytic production of alternative aviation fuels using lipids. However, rapid deactivation due to coking, poisoning, and sintering hinder the operation of these catalysts. Coking, which is predominantly responsible for pyrolysis catalyst deactivation, should be targeted in future research on novel catalysts. The synthetic strategy of catalysts and the mitigation of their issues are critical to the design of novel catalytic pyrolysis systems for the efficient cracking of triglyceride-rich feedstock to yield alternative aviation fuels.

TI  - False-positives and false-negatives in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT): what can we learn from a meta-analyses on > 750,000 tests?
T2  - MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS
AB  - Background Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has had an incomparable triumph in prenatal diagnostics in the last decade. Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. Methods The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. Results A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results.

TI  - A Critical Review on Transplacental Transfer of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances: Prenatal Exposure Levels, Characteristics, and Mechanisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)has aroused public concerns as it can pose multiple health threats to pregnant women andcause adverse birth outcomes for fetuses. In previous studies, the prenatal exposure levels andtransplacental transfer efficiencies (TTE) of PFASs have been reported and discussed.Specifically, the binding affinities between PFASs and some transporters were determined,demonstrating that the TTE values of PFASs are highly dependent on their binding behaviors.To summarize primaryfindings of previous studies and propose potential guidance for futureresearch, this article provides a systematic overview on levels and characteristics of prenatalexposure to PFASs worldwide, summarizes relationships between TTE values and structuresof PFASs, and discusses possible transplacental transfer mechanisms, especially for thecombination between PFASs and transporters. Given the critical roles of transporters in thetransplacental transfer of PFASs, we conducted molecular docking to further clarify thebinding behaviors between PFASs and the selected transporters. We proposed that themachine learning can be a superior method to predict and reveal behaviors and mechanisms of the transplacental transfer of PFASs.In total, this is thefirst review providing a comprehensive overview on the prenatal exposure levels and transplacental transfer mechanisms of PFASs.

TI  - Synthesis, properties, and applications of carbyne nanocrystals
T2  - MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING R-REPORTS
AB  - Since the first observation of fullerene nearly three decades ago, allotropes of carbon, including carbon nanotube and graphene, have been the focus of considerable research because of their remarkable physical and chemical properties that suggest the potential for a wide variety of practical applications. Well known, in terms of carbonatom hybridization, well-established forms of carbon are diamond with the three-dimensional sp3-hybridized carbon atoms and graphite with the two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon atoms which have been known and utilized for millennia. Additionally, more carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene composed of sp2-hybridized carbon, and Lonsdaleite and C8 composed of sp3-hybridized carbon each show unique properties, usually different from those of either diamond or graphite, offering technological breakthroughs. Sequentially, there is the third carbon, i.e., carbyne with the one-dimensional sp-hybridization, which would result in an allotrope of carbon, whereas diamond and graphite feature three- and two-dimensional ones, respectively. Recently, carbyne nanocrystals (CNCs), the condensed phase of carbyne with the finite chain length and the one-dimensional sp-hybridized carbon atoms with the alternating carbon-carbon single and triple bonds, the dubbed the third carbon, have been synthesized in the laboratory (Science Advances 2015; 1 (9): e1500857), and these CNCs are white powders, so they are called white carbon. Interestingly, there have been many works showing that CNCs possess potential applications in luminescence, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic sensing and biomedicine probes. Therefore, these findings above imply that we have being on the threshold of a new era of carbyne science and technology. This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and accessible review of general interest to the material community. Therefore, the review will survey the latest progresses of CNCs, provide a comprehensive understanding of synthesis, structure, property, and applications of CNCs, and put forward the perspective for the further development of CNCs. Firstly, we will present the basic understanding of classification and definition of carbyne. The history of carbyne research will be introduced and different definitions of carbyne in different periods are summarized. Next, a reasonable classification of carbyne research is proposed. Secondly, we will briefly introduce various approaches for the synthesis of carbyne and focus on describing LAL technique which is more suitable to produce CNCs compared with other methods. Thirdly, we will summarize structure, properties, and related applications of CNCs, including electronics, optics and magnetism, and optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Finally, we will summarize the development and unresolved issues so far, and suggest the future direction in this emerging and promising research field.

TI  - Environmental and occupational factors and higher risk of couple infertility: a systematic review study
T2  - MIDDLE EAST FERTILITY SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Infertility is a global health problem that represents an increasing trend due to new lifestyles following technological advances since individuals are facing more risk factors than before. The present systematic review study aimed to investigate the impact of environmental and occupational factors on reproductive parameters and increased risk of couple infertility. Main body: Scopus, PubMed, SID, and Web of Science databases were searched for the available observational (i.e., cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional) systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical trial studies between 2007 and 2019. To this end, keywords such as 'Environmental exposure', 'Occupational exposure', 'Environmental pollutants', 'Environmental pollution', 'Couple infertility', 'Sterility', and 'Sub-fertility' were used. The retrieved investigations examined the impact of environmental and occupational risk factors on reproductive indices and increased infertility risk. Totally, 66 out of 9519 papers were evaluated after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reported risk factors in the reviewed studies were heavy metals, cigarette smoking, and exposure to chemicals through consumer goods, urban life, and proximity to main roads. In addition, occupational factors included heavy physical activity, prolonged sitting, exposure to a hot environment, contact with formaldehyde, pesticides, insecticides, mechanical vibration, and contact with ionizing radiation, all of which affected the reproductive parameters. However, some researchers found no significant associations in this regard. Short conclusion: In general, individuals with known impairments in reproductive parameters were more exposed to risk factors. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to determine the risk of infertility in the population.

TI  - The Association between ADHD and Environmental Chemicals-A Scoping Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been of interest in recent research. This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD.

TI  - Recent advances in photocatalytic polyfluoroarylation
T2  - CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Polyfluoroaryl compounds belong to privileged moieties and engender distinct properties in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Over the past decade, considerable seminal reports and reviews have merely paid close attention to fluoroalkylation chemistry, such as trifluoromethylation, difluoroalkylation, perfluoroalkylation, trifluoromethylthiolation or trifluoromethoxylation. Polyfluoroarylation has inevitably lagged somewhat behind its fluoroalkylation counterparts, emanating from a lack of awareness and understanding of the synthetic significance. Together with the renaissance of photochemistry, the photocatalytic polyfluoroarylation using polyfluoroarenes as an inexpensive and easy-available radical precursor has emerged as a topical interest and vibrant area of chemical research. In this review, we have endeavored to present the state-of-the-art in photocatalytic polyfluoroarylation since 2014, and the discussions cover the basic concept, reaction design, mechanistic insight, and research prospects, which are organized by the reaction types. We hope this review will provide a comprehensive overview of this topic and stimulate significant research interest.

TI  - Metabolomics for exposure assessment and toxicity effects of occupational pollutants: current status and future perspectives
T2  - METABOLOMICS
AB  - Introduction Work-related exposures to harmful agents or factors are associated with an increase in incidence of occupational diseases. These exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors, challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant. Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites. Objectives The aim of this study is to review the application of metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to occupational diseases. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to 2021. Results Most of reviewed studies included worker populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride. Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes. The reviewed studies demonstrate that metabolomics provides a powerful ability to identify metabolic phenotypes and bioeffect of occupational exposures. Conclusion Continued application to worker populations has the potential to enable characterization of thousands of chemical signals in biological samples, which could lead to discovery of new biomarkers of exposure for chemicals, identify possible toxicological mechanisms, and improved understanding of biological effects increasing disease risk associated with occupational exposure.

TI  - Intraocular Tamponade Choice with Vitrectomy and Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling for Idiopathic Macular Hole A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - OPHTHALMOLOGY RETINA
AB  - Topic: A variety of different tamponade agents are used with vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling for the treatment of idiopathic macular holes. These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51-1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30-0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. (C) 2022 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

TI  - Source, fate, transport and modelling of selected emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment: Current status and future perspectives
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - The occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs), such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in aquatic environments represent a major threat to water resources due to their potential risks to the ecosystem and humans even at trace levels. Mathematical modelling can be a useful tool as a comprehensive approach to study their fate and transport in natural waters. However, modelling studies of the occurrence, fate and transport of ECs in aquatic environments have generally received far less attention than the more widespread field and laboratory studies. In this study, we reviewed the current status of modelling ECs based on selected represen-tative ECs, including their sources, fate and various mechanisms as well as their interactions with the sur-rounding environments in aquatic ecosystems, and explore future development and perspectives in this area. Most importantly, the principles, mathematical derivations, ongoing development and applications of various ECs models in different geographical regions are critically reviewed and discussed. The recommendations for improving data quality, monitoring planning, model development and applications were also suggested. The outcomes of this review can lay down a future framework in developing a comprehensive ECs modelling approach to help researchers and policymakers effectively manage water resources impacted by rising levels of ECs.

TI  - Bioremediation of perfluorochemicals: current state and the way forward
T2  - BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - Perfluorochemicals are widely found in the environment due to their versatile uses and persistent nature. Perfluorochemicals have also been detected in human and animals due to direct or indirect exposures, giving rise to health concerns. This review aims to examine the bioremediation of perfluorochemicals with plants, bacteria and fungi, including their efficiency and limitations. It also aims to propose the future prospects of bioremediation of perfluorochemicals. This review retrieved peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2021 from journal databases consisting of Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect. This review shows that multiple Pseudomonas species could degrade perfluorochemicals particularly perfluoroalkyl acids under aerobic condition. Acidimicrobium sp. degraded perfluoroalkyl acids anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. A mixed Pseudomonas culture was more effective than pure cultures. Multiple plants were found to bioconcentrate perfluorochemicals and many demonstrated the ability to hyperaccumulate perfluoroalkyl acids, particularly Festuca rubra, Salix nigra and Betula nigra. Fungal species, particularly Pseudeurotium sp. and Geomyces sp., have the potential to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid. Perfluorochemicals bioremediation could be advanced with identification of more candidate species for bioremediation, optimization of bioremediation conditions, mixed culturing, experiments with environmental media and studies on the biochemical pathways of biotransformation. This review provides comprehensive insight into the efficiency of different bacterial, plant and fungal species in perfluorochemicals bioremediation under different conditions, their limitations and improvement.

TI  - EDC-induced mechanisms of immunotoxicity: a systematic review
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to a group of chemicals that cause adverse effects in human health, impairing hormone production and regulation, resulting in alteration of homeostasis, reproductive, and developmental, and immune system impairments. The immunotoxicity of EDCs involves many mechanisms altering gene expression that depend on the activation of nuclear receptors such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which also results in skin and intestinal disorders, microbiota alterations and inflammatory diseases. This systematic review aims to review different mechanisms of immunotoxicity and immunomodulation of T cells, focusing on T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 subsets, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) caused by specific EDCs such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), bisphenols (BPs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). To achieve this objective, a systematic study was conducted searching various databases including PubMed and Scopus to find in-vitro, in-vivo, and biomonitoring studies that examine EDC-dependent mechanisms of immunotoxicity. While doing the systematic review, we found species- and cell-specific outcomes and a translational gap between in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Finally, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is proposed, which explains mechanistically toxicity endpoints emerging from different EDCs having similar key events and can help to improve our understanding of EDCs mechanisms of immunotoxicity. In conclusion, this review provides insights into the mechanisms of immunotoxicity mediated by EDCs and will help to improve human health risk assessment.

TI  - Production and possible reduction of greenhouse gases produced during GI endoscopy activity: a systematic review of available literature
T2  - GUT
AB  - Background and aimsGreenhouse gases (GHGs) that trap heat in the atmosphere are composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases (synthetic hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and nitrogen trifluoride). In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. DesignThe GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. ResultsOur search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. ConclusionsRecognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future.

TI  - Effects of chemical pollution on the behaviour of cichlid fish
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
AB  - Pollution is one of the most relevant issues for the conservation of freshwater environments. Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants-both individually and in combination-such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced native distributions are suitable study species to provide information for the conservation of freshwater environments.

TI  - Studying the Impact of Persistent Organic Pollutants Exposure on Human Health by Proteomic Analysis: A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic chemical substances that are widely distributed in environments around the globe. POPs accumulate in living organisms and are found at high concentrations in the food chain. Humans are thus continuously exposed to these chemical substances, in which they exert hepatic, reproductive, developmental, behavioral, neurologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immunologic adverse health effects. However, considerable information is unknown regarding the mechanism by which POPs exert their adverse effects in humans, as well as the molecular and cellular responses involved. Data are notably lacking concerning the consequences of acute and chronic POP exposure on changes in gene expression, protein profile, and metabolic pathways. We conducted a systematic review to provide a synthesis of knowledge of POPs arising from proteomics-based research. The data source used for this review was PubMed. This study was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. Of the 742 items originally identified, 89 were considered in the review. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the most recent research and available solutions to explore proteomics datasets to identify new features relevant to human health. Future perspectives in proteomics studies are discussed.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Scientific Literature on Pollutant Removal from Stormwater Runoff from Vacant Urban Lands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Even though the common acknowledgment that vacant urban lands (VUL) can play a positive role in improving stormwater management, little synthesized literature is focused on understanding how VUL can take advantage of different stormwater control measures (SCMs) to advance urban water quality. The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs' removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL's size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces.

TI  - Environmental health influences in pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy complications globally. Environmental risk factors may lead to increased glucose levels and GDM, which in turn may affect not only the health of the mother but assuming hypotheses of "fetal programming", also the health of the offspring. In addition to traditional GDM risk factors, the evidence is growing that environmental influences might affect the development of GDM. We conducted a systematic review analyzing the association between several environmental health risk factors in pregnancy, including climate factors, chemicals and metals, and GDM. Methods We performed a systematic literature search in Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection databases for research articles published until March 2021. Epidemiological human and animal model studies that examined GDM as an outcome and / or glycemic outcomes and at least one environmental risk factor for GDM were included. Results Of n = 91 studies, we classified n = 28 air pollution, n = 18 persistent organic pollutants (POP), n = 11 arsenic, n = 9 phthalate n = 8 bisphenol A (BPA), n = 8 seasonality, n = 6 cadmium and n = 5 ambient temperature studies. In total, we identified two animal model studies. Whilst we found clear evidence for an association between GDM and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, cadmium, arsenic, POPs and phthalates, the findings regarding phenols were rather inconsistent. There were clear associations between adverse glycemic outcomes and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, POPs, phenols, and phthalates. Findings regarding cadmium and arsenic were heterogeneous (n = 2 publications in each case). Conclusions Environmental risk factors are important to consider in the management and prevention of GDM. In view of mechanisms of fetal programming, the environmental risk factors investigated may impair the health of mother and offspring in the short and long term. Further research is needed.

TI  - An overview of different strategies involved in an efficient control of emerging contaminants: Promising enzymes and the related reaction process
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Emerging contaminants (ECs) are primarily composed of the synthetic organic chemicals, arising from industry emission, medicinal, husbandry, and domestic waste. ECs such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) not only make a serious threat on the environment conditions but also human health. A comprehensive review about ECs including the occurrence and ecotoxicity, as well as the controlling strategies was made. Firstly, the idea of ECs ''block'' was introduced to connect different ECs during the supply of feed and food chain. The existence of ECs in different contaminant blocks would eventually affect human health. Secondly, the conventional strategies including physical, chemical, and biological methods against ECs were presented such as the removal of PPCPs and PAHs. Notably, conventional strategies like filtration, adsorption, and sedimentation could hardly eliminate the parent compound of ECs. Last but not least, the biological strategies employed by the oxidoreductases (ORs) group like lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, laccase, and horseradish peroxidase were also evaluated for ECs elimination. Although the elimination of pharmaceuticals by the lignin peroxidase and laccase in lab-scale are gratifying, the removal of other ECs like PAHs, and PFCs are still insufficient by the ORs family. All in all, a combination of conventional strategies with enzymatic-based catalysis would greatly integrate the advantages and allow a promising, efficient, and eco-friendly controllable solution to ECs decontamination.

TI  - Treasuring industrial sulfur by-products: A review on add-value to reductive sulfide and sulfite for contaminant removal and hydrogen production
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Reductive sulfur-containing by-products (S-BPs) released from industrial process mainly exist in the simple form of sulfide and sulfite. In this study, recent advances to remove and make full use of reductive S-BPs to achieve efficient contaminant removal and hydrogen production are critically reviewed. Sulfide, serves as both reductant and nucleophile, can form intermediates with the catalyst surface functional group through chemical interaction, efficiently promoting the catalytic reduction process to remove contaminants. Sulfite assisted catalytic process could be classified to the advanced reduction processes (ARPs) and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), mainly depending on the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the solution. During ARPs, sulfite could generate reductive active species including hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)), hydrogen radical (Hmiddot), and sulfite radical (SO3 center dot-) under the irradiation of UV light, leading to the efficient reduction removal of a variety of contaminants. During AOPs, sulfite could first produce SO3 center dot- under the action of the catalyst or energy, initiating a series of reactions to produce oxysulfur radicals. Various contaminants could be effectively removed under the role of these oxidizing active species. Sulfides and sulfites could also be removed along with promoting hydrogen production via photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes. Besides, the present limitations and the prospects for future practical applications of the process with these S-BPs are proposed. Overall, this review gives a comprehensive summary and aims to provide new insights and thoughts in promoting contaminant removal and hydrogen production through taking full advantage of reductive S-BPs.

TI  - Untargeted metabolomics reveals that multiple reproductive toxicants are present at the endometrium
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - on the female reproductive system. Few studies have examined exposure at reproductive organs. Our aim was to perform a preliminary untargeted metabolomic characterization of menstrual blood, a novel biofluid, to identify environmental toxins present in the endometrium and evaluate the suitability of this sample type for exposome research. Methods: Whole blood menstrual samples were collected from four women using a menstrual cup. Samples were analyzed for small molecules that include both environmental chemicals and endogenous metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA was used to identify differences within and between individuals' menstrual blood metabolomic profiles, and the influence of the sample processing method. To assess the presence of environmental exposures, LC-HRMS chemical profiles were matched to the ToxCast chemical database, which includes 4557 commonly used commercial chemicals. Select compounds were confirmed by comparison to reference standards. Results: PCA of metabolome profiles showed analysis of menstrual blood samples were highly reproducible, with high variability in detected metabolites between participants and low variability between analytical replicates of an individual's sample. Endogenous metabolites detected in menstrual blood samples achieved good coverage of the human blood metabolome. We found 1748 annotations for environmental chemicals, including suspected reproductive toxicants such as phenols, parabens, phthalates, and organochlorines. Storage temperature for the first 24 h did not significantly influence global metabolomic profiles.

TI  - Direct Perfluoroalkylation of C-H Bonds in (Hetero)arenes
T2  - CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB  - Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules commonly utilized in many areas such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and material sciences. Due to their unique properties, they have attracted significant interest from synthetic chemists and various methods have been developed for their synthesis. Among them, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp(2))-H bonds in (hetero)arenes is one of the most attractive and straightforward ones, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity. All methods available have been classified according to the nature of the perfluoroalkyl chain introduced, trifluoromethylation reactions being overviewed in a separate section, and to the nature of the reagents/catalysts required.

TI  - TiO2 Containing Hybrid Composite Polymer Membranes for Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries
T2  - POLYMERS
AB  - In recent years, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) have captured immense attraction in electrochemical energy storage systems due to their long cycle life, flexibility, high-energy efficiency, time, and reliability. In VRFB, polymer membranes play a significant role in transporting protons for current transmission and act as barriers between positive and negative electrodes/electrolytes. Commercial polymer membranes (such as Nafion) are the widely used IEM in VRFBs due to their outstanding chemical stability and proton conductivity. However, the membrane cost and increased vanadium ions permeability limit its commercial application. Therefore, various modified perfluorinated and non-perfluorinated membranes have been developed. This comprehensive review primarily focuses on recent developments of hybrid polymer composite membranes with inorganic TiO2 nanofillers for VRFB applications. Hence, various fabrications are performed in the membrane with TiO2 to alter their physicochemical properties for attaining perfect IEM. Additionally, embedding the -SO3H groups by sulfonation on the nanofiller surface enhances membrane proton conductivity and mechanical strength. Incorporating TiO2 and modified TiO2 (sTiO(2), and organic silica modified TiO2) into Nafion and other non-perfluorinated membranes (sPEEK and sPI) has effectively influenced the polymer membrane properties for better VRFB performances. This review provides an overall spotlight on the impact of TiO2-based nanofillers in polymer matrix for VRFB applications.

TI  - Climate change influence on the levels and trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and chemicals of emerging Arctic concern (CEACs) in the Arctic physical environment - a review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB  - Climate change brings about significant changes in the physical environment in the Arctic. Increasing temperatures, sea ice retreat, slumping permafrost, changing sea ice regimes, glacial loss and changes in precipitation patterns can all affect how contaminants distribute within the Arctic environment and subsequently impact the Arctic ecosystems. In this review, we summarized observed evidence of the influence of climate change on contaminant circulation and transport among various Arctic environment media, including air, ice, snow, permafrost, fresh water and the marine environment. We have also drawn on parallel examples observed in Antarctica and the Tibetan Plateau, to broaden the discussion on how climate change may influence contaminant fate in similar cold-climate ecosystems. Significant knowledge gaps on indirect effects of climate change on contaminants in the Arctic environment, including those of extreme weather events, increase in forests fires, and enhanced human activities leading to new local contaminant emissions, have been identified. Enhanced mobilization of contaminants to marine and freshwater ecosystems has been observed as a result of climate change, but better linkages need to be made between these observed effects with subsequent exposure and accumulation of contaminants in biota. Emerging issues include those of Arctic contamination by microplastics and higher molecular weight halogenated natural products (hHNPs) and the implications of such contamination in a changing Arctic environment is explored.

TI  - Pathways of organic micropollutants degradation in atmospheric pressure plasma processing - A review
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Concern of toxic compounds and their, potentially more harmful degradation products, present in aquatic environment alarmed scientific community and research on the development of novel technologies for wastewater treatment had become of great interest. Up to this date, many papers pointed out the challenges and limitations of conventional wastewater treatment and of some advanced oxidation processes. Advanced technologies based on the use of non-equilibrium or non-thermal plasma had been recognized as a possible solution for, not only degradation, but for complete removal of recalcitrant organic micropollutants. While previous review papers have been focused on plasma physics and chemistry of different types of discharges for few organic micropollutants, this paper brings comprehensive review of current knowledge on the chemistry and degradation pathways by using different non-thermal plasma types for several micropollutants' classes, such as pharmaceuticals, perfluorinated compounds, pesticides, phenols and dyes and points out some major research gaps.

TI  - Computational toxicology studies on the interactions between environmental contaminants and biomacromolecules
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB  - Through manufacturing operations, product consumption, and drug administration, humans and wildlife are continuously exposed to environmental contaminants (ECs) throughout their lives. Faced with the potentially harmful effects of ECs on humans, regulatory agencies around the world require the integration of epidemiological, in vivo toxicological, and in vitro mechanistic data to provide the necessary information for hazard classification, labeling, and risk management of chemicals. However, animal studies have time-consuming and high-cost defects and ethical problems. High-throughput in vitro assays are also unable to provide systematic toxicological information for chemical hazard classification for over 100000 chemicals in commerce.
   Recently, computing resources and artificial intelligence have innovatively improved the accuracy and speed of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the structural biology and deep learning (DL) algorithms (e.g., AlphaFold2 and AF2Complex) have incrementally resolved a large number of biomolecular crystal structures. Thus, the use of computational toxicology techniques in environmental toxicology has increased significantly. It is estimated that computational toxicology techniques can perform virtual screening of millions of compounds in a limited amount of time for the contaminant-biomolecule interaction process. Thus, computational toxicology techniques can reduce the initial experimental cost of identifying environmental emerging contaminants, increase information on the toxicity mechanisms of ECs, and improve the efficiency of hazard identification of ECs by regulatory authorities.
   This study systematically reviews computational toxicology techniques commonly used to analyze ECs-biomolecule interactions, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and machine learning-based modelling. Molecular docking is a well-established molecular simulation method that explores the interactions between biomolecules and small molecules to predict their binding modes and binding affinities. MD can simulate the flexible binding process of contaminant-biomolecule and the dynamic conformational shift process of contaminant-biomolecule complexes, providing more comprehensive information on the interaction mechanism. Machine learning-based modelling is a novel computational toxicology technique that is completely different from molecular simulation. It mainly uses publicly available structural information and in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo bioactivity data to construct (quantitative) structure-activity relationships (Q)SARs based on ML algorithms, and uses (Q)SAR models to rapidly improve the efficiency of virtual screening of ECs targeted at biomolecules, and further deepen the analysis of contaminant-biomolecule interaction mechanisms in complex biological contexts. In this paper, the main applications of these techniques in the field of environmental toxicology in recent years are systematically reviewed, including the mechanistic studies of contaminant-biomolecule interactions and high-throughput virtual screening. The advantages and limitations of these techniques in terms of ligand-receptor interaction, explainability, training efficiency, computational depth, and biological processes are discussed. Results showed that MD simulations, which can deeply explore contaminant-biomolecule interactions, are unable to achieve the high-throughput virtual screening of ECs. Machine learning-based modelling, which can reflect the complex biological processes and achieve high accuracy prediction, unable to effectively interpret the prediction results due to the 'black box' defects. Molecular docking, which has the potential to be a high throughput virtual screening method, is limited by local sampling and approximate scoring function deficiencies. These problems limit the ability of molecular docking to analyze more comprehensive mechanisms of ECs-biomolecule interactions. Therefore, only the combination of multiple computational toxicology techniques to develop an integrated workflow for mechanistic analysis and virtual screening can compensate for their respective shortcomings and obtain optimal results. However, how to increase the computational throughput screening while maintaining the mechanism analysis remains a key issue to be addressed in the future.

TI  - Recent Advancements in Polysulfone Based Membranes for Fuel Cell (PEMFCs, DMFCs and AMFCs) Applications: A Critical Review
T2  - POLYMERS
AB  - In recent years, ion electrolyte membranes (IEMs) preparation and properties have attracted fabulous attention in fuel cell usages owing to its high ionic conductivity and chemical resistance. Currently, perfluorinatedsulfonicacid (PFSA) membrane has been widely employed in the membrane industry in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs); however, Nafion(TM) suffers reduced proton conductivity at a higher temperature, requiring noble metal catalyst (Pt, Ru, and Pt-Ru), and catalyst poisoning by CO. Non-fluorinated polymers are a promising substitute. Polysulfone (PSU) is an aromatic polymer with excellent characteristics that have attracted membrane scientists in recent years. The present review provides an up-to-date development of PSU based electrolyte membranes and its composites for PEMFCs, alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) application. Various fillers encapsulated in the PEM/AEM moiety are appraised according to their preliminary characteristics and their plausible outcome on PEMFC/DMFC/AMFC. The key issues associated with enhancing the ionic conductivity and chemical stability have been elucidated as well. Furthermore, this review addresses the current tasks, and forthcoming directions are briefly summarized of PEM/AEMs for PEMFCs, DMFCs, AMFCs.

TI  - Intraluminal oxygen mitigates acute mesenteric ischaemia: a systematic review of methods and outcomes in animal studies
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - BackgroundAcute Mesenteric Ischaemic (AMI) is a rare condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Many causes of AMI exist, which usually begin with mucosal injury. Onset is insiduous and there is frequent diagnostic delay. Current treatments can only control established injury and prevent propagation, hence new interventions are needed. The prevention and treatment of AMI by intraluminal delivery of oxygen has yet to be investigated in the clinical setting. This article aims to systemically review experimental studies investigating this novel therapy. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, searches of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were performed up to June 2022. Two independent investigators extracted the data. ResultsThere were 20 experimental studies, 16 of which used an occlusive ischaemia reperfusion model. Six different formulations were used to deliver intraluminal oxygen, with perflurocarbon being the most common. Studies consistently showed local and systemic benefits. Intraluminal oxygen therapy improved histological severity of mucosal injury in all studies when oxygen was delivered during the ischaemia phase, but could cause harm if given during the reperfusion phase. Improvement was also demonstrated in endpoints assessing intestinal function, biomarkers of intestinal damage, measures of systemic physiological derangement and mortality. ConclusionIntraluminal oxygenation appears to be an effective treatment for AMI. There remain significant questions regarding optimal timing and delivery formulation before clinical translation of this treatment strategy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
AB  - Purpose Environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a mixture of chemical compounds capable to interfere with endocrine axis at different levels and to which population is daily exposed. This paper aims to review the relationship between EDCs and breast, prostate, testicle, ovary, and thyroid cancer, discussing carcinogenic activity of known EDCs, while evaluating the impact on public health.Methods A literature review regarding EDCs and cancer was carried out with particular interest on meta-analysis and human studies.Results The definition of EDCs has been changed through years, and currently there are no common criteria to test new chemicals to clarify their possible carcinogenic activity. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption.Conclusion EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer. New evidence supports the role of other EDCs as possible carcinogenic and pregnant women should avoid risk area and exposure. The relationship between EDCs and cancer supports the need for effective prevention policies increasing public awareness.

TI  - Emerging periodate-based oxidation technologies for water decontamination: A state-of-the-art mechanistic review and future perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - With the ever-increasing severity of the ongoing water crisis, it is of great significance to develop efficient, eco-friendly water treatment technologies. As an emerging oxidant in the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), periodate (PI) has received worldwide attention owing to the advantages of superior stability, susceptible acti-vation capability, and high efficiency for decontamination. This is the first review that conducts a comprehensive analysis of the mechanism, pollutant transformation pathway, toxicity evolution, barriers, and future directions of PI-based AOPs based on the scientific information and experimental data reported in recent years. The pollutant elimination in PI-based AOPs was mainly attributed to the in situ generate reactive oxygen species (e.g., & BULL;OH, O(3P), 1O2, and O2 & BULL;-), reactive iodine species (e.g., IO3 & BULL; and IO4 & BULL;), and high-valent metal-oxo species with exceptionally high reactivity. These reactive species were derived from the PI activated by the external energy, metal activators, alkaline, freezing, hydroxylamine, H2O2, etc. It is noteworthy that direct electron transport could also dominate the decontamination in carbon-based catalyst/PI systems. Furthermore, PI was transformed to iodate (IO3?) stoichiometrically via an oxygen-atom transfer process in most PI-based AOPs systems. However, the production of I2, I-, and HOI was sometimes inevitable. Furthermore, the transformation pathway of typical micropollutants was clarified, and the in silico QSAR-based prediction results indicated that most transformation products retained biodegradation recalcitrance and multi-endpoint toxicity. The barriers faced by the PI-based AOPs were also clarified with potential solutions. Finally, future perspectives and research directions are highlighted based on the current state of PI-based AOPs. This review enhances our in-depth understanding of PI -based AOPs for pollutant elimination and identifies future research needs to focus on the reduction of toxic byproducts.

TI  - Fluoroalkylated-GAP copolymers (GAP-FP) as promising energetic binders
T2  - REACTIVE & FUNCTIONAL POLYMERS
AB  - The development of a novel energetic block copolymer of glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) and fluoropolymer (FP) using a boron trifluoride-tetrahydrofuran complex/diol initiator system is reported herein. Well-defined com-positions of the GAP-FP copolymers in two different GAP to FP ratios (1:1 and 1:3) were synthesized by tailoring the desired molecular weights of each block in the copolymer, demonstrating the synthetic versatility of such a copolymer system. The resultant GAP-FP copolymers represent a unique hybrid binder system with tunable energy releasing and oxidizing potentials intended for metallized formulations. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the carbonaceous residue usually formed from the decomposition of GAP could be reduced significantly by the copolymerization with FP. Isoconversional method of kinetic analysis of the GAP-FP co-polymers revealed an increasing dependence of the effective activation energy on the extent of conversion. The increasing dependence suggested a mechanism of the competing reactions that were found to be between the reactions of FP triggered oxidation and intermolecular crosslinking of the polyimine intermediates formed from GAP decomposition that ultimately resulted in the reduction of the carbonaceous residue.

TI  - Boron cluster anions and their derivatives in complexation reactions
T2  - COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB  - Boron cluster anions attract the interest of chemists because of their electronic structures, geometry, and chemical behavior. These weak coordinating ligands allow one to vary their structure and properties of the final compounds. Here, we discuss the coordination ability of unsubstituted anions [BnHn](2- )(n = 6, 10, 12), a number of their mono- and disubstituted derivatives of different compoition and perhalogenated anions [B(n)Hal(n)](2- )(Hal = F, Cl, Br, I; n = 10, 12), as well as dimeric boron cluster [B20H18](2- )in the presence of solvents and organic ligands depending on the nature of complexing agent. The boron cluster anions form mononuclear, binuclear, and polymeric complexes in reactions with metals that act as Pearson's soft acids (Cu(I), Ag(I), Pb(II), Hg(II)). Metals belonging to the intermediate group (Zn (II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Mn(II)) form cationic complexes with boron cluster anions as counterions. In the presence of metals acting as hard acids (Fe(III), Co(III)), boron clusters usually participate as reducing agents decreasing the metal oxidation state. This review allows one to trace the effect of different geometry of boron polyhedra and substitutes introduced into the boron cage on coordination ability of boron clusters with a giving metal.

TI  - Health impact assessment of pet cats caused by organohalogen contaminants by serum metabolomics and thyroid hormone analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Companion animals are in close contact with the human surroundings, and there is growing concern about the effects of harmful substances on the health of pet cats. In this study, we investigated the potential health effects of organohalogen compounds (OHCs) on thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis and metabolomics in Japanese pet cats. There was a significant negative correlation between concentrations of several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and THs in cat serum samples. These results suggested that exposure to OHCs causes a decrease in serum TH levels in pet cats. In this metabolomics study, each exposure level of parent compounds (PCBs and PBDEs) and their hydroxylated compounds (OH-PCBs and OH-PBDEs) were associated with their own unique primary metabolic pathways, suggesting that parent and phenolic compounds exhibit different mechanisms of action and biological effects. PCBs were associated with many metabolic pathways, including glutathione and purine metabolism, and the effects were replicated in in-vivo cat PCB administration studies. These results demonstrated that OHC exposure causes chronic oxidative stress in pet cats.PBDEs were positively associated with alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Due to the chronic exposure of cats to mixtures of these contaminants, the combination of their respective metabolic pathways may have a synergistic effect.

TI  - Synthesis of Fluorinated and Fluoroalkylated Heterocycles Containing at Least One Sulfur Atom via Cycloaddition Reactions
T2  - MATERIALS
AB  - Fluorinated heterocycles constitute an important group of organic compounds with a rapidly growing number of applications in such areas as medicinal chemistry, agrochemicals production, polymer chemistry, as well as chemistry of advanced materials. In the latter case, fluorinated thiophenes are considered as a lead class of compounds with numerous spectacular applications. On the other hand, cycloaddition reactions offer a superior methodology for stereo-chemically controlled synthesis of heterocycles with a diverse ring size and a variable number of heteroatoms. A comprehensive review of methods based on cycloaddition reactions and applied for construction of fluorinated and/or fluoroalkylated S-heterocycles has not yet been published. For this reason, the main goal of the presented review was to fill the existing gap and to summarize the results published over last six decades. In this context, the [3+2]- and [4+2]-cycloadditions (Huisgen reactions, and Diels-Alder reactions, respectively) are of special importance. Some questions related to the discussed mechanisms of cycloaddition processes observed in reactions with electron deficient, fluorinated substrates (dipolarophiles and dienophiles), and electron-rich sulfur containing counter partners, are of fundamental importance for the development of interpretations of organic reaction mechanisms.

TI  - Recent advances in mechanical force-responsive drug delivery systems
T2  - NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB  - Mechanical force responsive drug delivery systems (in terms of mechanical force induced chemical bond breakage or physical structure destabilization) have been recently explored to exhibit a controllable pharmaceutical release behaviour at a molecular level. In comparison with chemical or biological stimulus triggers, mechanical force is not only an external but also an internal stimulus which is closely related to the physiological status of patients. However, although this mechanical force stimulus might be one of the most promising and feasible sources to achieve on-demand pharmaceutical release, current research in this field is still limited. Hence, this tutorial review aims to comprehensively evaluate the recent advances in mechanical force-responsive drug delivery systems based on different types of mechanical force, in terms of direct stimulation by compressive, tensile, and shear force, or indirect/remote stimulation by ultrasound and a magnetic field. Furthermore, the exciting developments and current challenges in this field will also be discussed to provide a blueprint for potential clinical translational research of mechanical force-responsive drug delivery systems.

TI  - One-Pot Synthesis and Characterization of Three Chromotropic Supramolecular Isomeric Cu(II) Coordination Polymers as 1-D Zigzag or Helical Chains with Homochiral or Heterochiral Cu(II) Coordination Centres
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
AB  - The reaction of 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) and 4 ' ,4''-(perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl) bis(([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid)) (H2L2) with Cu(CH3COO)(2)center dot H2O in DMF/H2O at 50 -90 ? in capped glass vials afforded three products with distinctively different colours and shapes. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the three products, namely {[Cu(phen)(L2)] center dot 1.25H(2)O} (1) (teal acicula, KPI = 60.6%), {[Cu(phen)(L-2)] center dot H2O center dot DMF}n(2) (sapphire blue plate, KPI = 65.6%) and {[Cu(phen)(L-2)] center dot 0.31H(2)O}n ( 3 ) (cool grey plate, KPI = 66.8%) are 1-D supramolecular Cu(II) coordination polymers. Both 1 and 2 are composed of 1-D zigzag chains with 1 contains heterochiral Cu(II) ( A- and A- alternatively) centres in the same chain and 2 contains homochiral Cu(II) ( A- or A-) centres in the same chain, while 3, containing homochiral Cu(II) ( A- or A-) centres, has a helical structure along a axis, with a rectangular channel of a size 19.61 x 16.61 A2. Each helical turn spans 10.74 A, composed of two [Cu(L2)(Phen)] units. With the largest KPI (-66.3%), the highest thermal stability, highest formation energy from DFT calculations and lowest hygroscopicity, 3 can be obtained as the only product at higher temperature (95 ?) and/or higher ratio of water (DMF/water (v/v) = 20:6), which implies that it is the thermodynamic product. 2 can be obtained at mediate temperature (60 -80 ?) as the only product or co-exist with other products, while 1 only appeared at low temperature (60 and 70 ?) in the solvents of DMF/water (v/v) = 20:2 or 20:3 at a very small amount. The chromotropism of the three isomers was examined using UV-Vis spectroscopic technique, and the coordination geometry of Cu(II) was examined with Hathaway's tetragonality analysis and Continuous Shape Measures Calculation using SHAPE 2.1 programme. Linear correlations between the solid-state UV-Vis absorption maxima of the three isomers against the tetragonality ( T ) or the distortion percentage of the coordination geometry of Cu(II) from a perfect octahedral (Doct) were observed. The three complexes were also analyzed by FT IR, TGA and DFT formation energy calculations. The thermodynamic stability and the thermal stability of the three isomer increases in order of 1 < 2 < 3 , supported by the analysis of the metal-ligand coordination bonds and the intermolecular interactions, the study of chromotropism and crystal fields, the effects of solvent polarity and temperature to the formation of isomers, the close-packing theory (KPI calculations), the DFT calculations and the TGA analysis.

TI  - Pollutants: a candidate as a new risk factor for osteoarthritis-results from a systematic literature review
T2  - RMD OPEN
AB  - Background Considering non-classical environmental risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA), a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to summarise existing knowledge on associations between OA and pollutants. Methods PubMed was used to identify studies reporting data on OA and pollutants in humans (examples of MeSH terms: "Pesticides" or "Polychlorinated Biphenyls" or 'Lead'). Reports included epidemiological clinical studies, pollutant assessments in ex vivo OA joint, and in vitro effects of pollutants on chondrocytes. Results Among the 193 potentially relevant articles, 14 were selected and combined with 9 articles obtained by manual search. Among these 23 articles there were: (1) 11 epidemiological studies on the relationship between OA and pollutants exposure, (2) 8 on pollutant concentrations in ex vivo OA joint, (3) 4 on the in vitro effects of pollutants on human chondrocytes. Epidemiological studies investigating mainly chlorinated and fluorinated pollutants suggested a possible link with OA. In cross-sectional studies, radiographic knee OA prevalence increased with higher serum lead levels. There was also a relationship between serum lead levels and serum/urine joint biomarkers. A high concentration of heavy metals in the cartilage tidemark was found in ex vivo joints. In vitro, the viability of chondrocytes was reduced in presence of some pollutants. However, the level of knowledge currently remains low, justifying the need for new methodologically sound studies. Conclusions This SLR supports the hypothesis of a possible involvement of pollutants in OA disease risk. Large-scale epidemiological and biological studies and ideally big-data analysis are needed to confirm that pollutants could be risk factors for OA.

TI  - Progress in Preparation and Application of Titanium Sub-Oxides Electrode in Electrocatalytic Degradation for Wastewater Treatment
T2  - CATALYSTS
AB  - To achieve low-carbon and sustainable development it is imperative to explore water treatment technologies in a carbon-neutral model. Because of its advantages of high efficiency, low consumption, and no secondary pollution, electrocatalytic oxidation technology has attracted increasing attention in tackling the challenges of organic wastewater treatment. The performance of an electrocatalytic oxidation system depends mainly on the properties of electrodes materials. Compared with the instability of graphite electrodes, the high expenditure of noble metal electrodes and boron-doped diamond electrodes, and the hidden dangers of titanium-based metal oxide electrodes, a titanium sub-oxide material has been characterized as an ideal choice of anode material due to its unique crystal and electronic structure, including high conductivity, decent catalytic activity, intense physical and chemical stability, corrosion resistance, low cost, and long service life, etc. This paper systematically reviews the electrode preparation technology of Magneli phase titanium sub-oxide and its research progress in the electrochemical advanced oxidation treatment of organic wastewater in recent years, with technical difficulties highlighted. Future research directions are further proposed in process optimization, material modification, and application expansion. It is worth noting that Magneli phase titanium sub-oxides have played very important roles in organic degradation. There is no doubt that titanium sub-oxides will become indispensable materials in the future.

TI  - Management of refractory and recurrent macular holes: A comprehensive review
T2  - SURVEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - The primary repair of full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs) through pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and gas tamponade is the current standard of practice and offers a high closure rate of approximately 90%. On the contrary, the surgical management of refractory (or persistent) and recurrent FTMHs is still a challenging and con-troversial topic in vitreoretinal surgery as multiple options have been suggested, particularly over the last few years, with no consensus regarding any appropriate selection criteria or the best surgical option. Moreover, the presence of various case series / interventional studies presenting comparable outcomes, as well as the absence of studies with a direct comparison of different surgical techniques, may result in confusion. We provide a structured and com-prehensive overview of the different surgical options currently available for the secondary repair of refractory and recurrent FTMHs. In addition to an update on epidemiology, diagno-sis and description of the surgical steps, we highlight the evidence available to support each of the described surgical techniques, specifically focusing on the presumed mechanisms of hole closure, advantages, and known prognostic factors.

TI  - The Advancement of Gas-Generating Nanoplatforms in Biomedical Fields: Current Frontiers and Future Perspectives
T2  - SMALL METHODS
AB  - Diverse gases (NO, CO, H2S, H-2, etc.) have been widely applied in the medical intervention of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury, bacterial infection, etc., attributing to their inherent biomedical activities. Although many gases have many biomedical activities, their clinical use is still limited due to the rapid and free diffusion behavior of these gases molecules, which may cause potential side effects and/or ineffective treatment. Gas-generating nanoplatforms (GGNs) are effective strategies to address the aforementioned challenges of gas therapy by preventing gas production or release at nonspecific sites, enhancing GGNs accumulation at targeted sites, and controlling gas release in response to exogenous (UV, NIR, US, etc.) or endogenous (H2O2, GSH, pH, etc.) stimuli at the lesion site, further maintaining gas concentration within the effective range and achieving the purpose of disease treatment. This review comprehensively summarizes the advancements of "state-of-the-art" GGNs in the recent three years, with emphasis on the composition, structure, preparation process, and gas release mechanism of the nanocarriers. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects and limitations of GGNs in preclinical studies using cell/animal models are discussed. Overall, this review enlightens the further development of this field and promotes the clinical transformation of gas therapy.

TI  - Cerebral concentration and toxicity of endocrine disrupting chemicals: The implication of blood-brain interfaces
T2  - NEUROTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) act on peripheral endocrine organs or interfere with general endocrine pathways. Several EDCs alter the central regulation of neuroendocrine pathways, and affect neurological functions, and as such can be classified as neurotoxic molecules. Environmental pollutants classified as EDCs and affecting the central nervous system include perfluoroalcanes, parabens, phthalates, organotins, bisphenols, benzophenones, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins. In this review we provide a brief description of these families of EDCs. We report and compare the EDC concentrations measured in the brain of humans and wild animals naturally exposed to these molecules, as well as in the brain of laboratory animals experimentally exposed to EDCs. The importance of using sophisticated analytical tools to detect EDCs in the brain is pointed out. The ability of blood-brain interfaces to reduce the brain exposition to EDCs in adult and during development is discussed in relation with the specific morphological, transport and metabolic properties of these cellular layers. Finally, we review the evidence that the neuroprotective functions of blood-brain interfaces can be altered by EDCs, a process that may participate to the central toxic action of these molecules. Overall this analysis points to the implication of blood-brain interfaces in setting the extent of central EDCs toxicity, although most evidence is indirect. Therefore, more specific blood-brain interface-oriented studies are called for in this field of EDC neurotoxicology.

TI  - Structural and transport properties of ultrathin perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer film in proton exchange membrane fuel cell catalyst layer: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
AB  - Although the properties of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes (10-100 s mu m thick) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been well studied for decades, the limited understanding of nano-sized PFSA ionomer within catalyst layer hampers the improvement of ultra-low platinum loading PEMFC. Recently, the vital role of PFSA ionomer in the local transfer of proton, oxygen, and water in fuel cell catalyst layer has been recognized, thus its properties have attracted more attention. In this review, a comprehensive comparison between PFSA bulk membrane and ultrathin PFSA ionomer film is summarized as morphology, physical properties (e.g., water uptake, surface wettability, diffusivity), and mechanical properties (e.g., crystallization, antiplasticization, glass transition point). Afterwards, the characteristics of ionomer in different dispersion media and the microstructure of PFSA ionomer in the formed catalyst layers are illuminated. The proton conduction and mass transport (i.e., oxygen and water) behaviors in the confined PFSA ionomer are focused and highlighted to reveal the ionomer's influence on fuel cell performance. Extrapolating from the insight into structural and transport properties of PFSA ionomer, we are optimistic that the performance of ultralow Pt loading PEMFCs could be greatly improved via modifying ionomer chemical structure and engineering ionomer/catalyst interaction.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - The chitosan-modified biochar composite, as a carbohydrate polymer, has received increasing attention and becomes a research hotspot. It is a promising impurity adsorption material, which has potential application value in the agricultural environment fields such as soil improvement and sewage purification. The composite can combine the advantages of biochar with chitosan, and the resulting composite usually exhibits a great improvement in its surface functional groups, adsorption sites, stability, and adsorption properties. In addition, compared to other adsorbents, the composite truly achieves the concept of "waste control by waste". In this paper, the preparation method, composite classification, adsorption mechanism, and models of biochar modified by chitosan are introduced, meanwhile, we also review and summarize their effects on the decontamination of wastewater and soil. In addition to common heavy metal ions, we also review the adsorption and removal of some other organic/inorganic pollutants, including (1) drug residues; (2) dyes; (3) phosphates; (4) radionuclides; (5) perfluorochemicals, etc. Moreover, challenges and prospects for the composite are presented and further studies are called for the chitosan-biochar composite. We believe that the composite will lead to further achievements in the field of environmental remediation.

TI  - Review on Research Progress of C6F12O as a Fire Extinguishing Agent
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
AB  - Clean gas fire suppressants with high efficiency are widely applied. This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement.

TI  - Development, dilemma and potential strategies for the application of nanocatalysts in wastewater catalytic ozonation: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - With the continuous development of nanomaterials in recent years, the application of nanocatalysts in catalytic ozone oxidation has attracted more and more researchers' at-tention due to their excellent catalytic properties. In this review, we systematically sum-marized the current research status of nanocatalysts mainly involving material categories, mechanisms and catalytic efficiency. Based on summary and analysis, we found most of the reported nanocatalysts were in the stage of laboratory research, which was caused by the nanocatalysts defects such as easy aggregation, difficult separation, and easy leakage. These defects might result in severe resource waste, economic loss and potentially adverse effects imposed on the ecosystem and human health. Aiming at solving these defects, we further analyzed the reasons and the existing reports, and revealed that coupling nano-catalyst and membrane, supported nanocatalysts and magnetic nanocatalysts had promising po-tential in solving these problems and promoting the actual application of nanocatalysts in wastewater treatment. Furthermore, the advantages, shortages and our perspectives of these methods are summarized and discussed. (c) 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Membrane polarization in non-neuronal cells as a potential mechanism of metabolic disruption by depolarizing insecticides
T2  - FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - A significant rise in the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has occurred worldwide in the last two decades. Concurrently, a growing body of evidence suggests a connection between exposure to environmental pollutants, particularly insecticides, and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes key evidence of (1) the presence of different types of neuronal receptors - target sites for neurotoxic insecticides - in non-neuronal cells, (2) the activation of these receptors in non-neuronal cells by membrane-depolarizing insecticides, and (3) changes in metabolic functions, including lipid and glucose accumulation, associated with changes in membrane potential. Based on these findings, we propose that changes in membrane potential (V-mem) by certain insecticides serve as a novel regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism in non-excitable cells associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.
