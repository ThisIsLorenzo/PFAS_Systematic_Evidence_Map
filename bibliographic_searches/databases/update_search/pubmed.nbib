TI  - Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and risk of gestational hypertension

AB  - Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been linked to 
      gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). However, the results were 
      conflicting and inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis 
      for an overview of these relationships. We searched PubMed, and Google Scholar 
      for studies investigating bisphenol A, phthalates, and per or poly-fluoroalkyl 
      substances and GH or PE. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) were calculated for risk estimate using the generic inverse variance method. 
      A total of 14 studies were included in the present analysis. The pooled results 
      demonstrated that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, OR:1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.39), 
      perfluoro octane sulfonic acid (PFOS, (OR:1.23, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.38), and 
      perfluononanoic acid (PFNA, OR:1.20, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.40) were significantly 
      associated with an increased risk of PE. There was no significant association 
      observed with perfluoro hexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluoro decanoic acid 
      (PFDA), perfluoro heptanoic acid (PFHpA), and perfluoro undecanoic acid (PFUnDA) 
      and PE. For GH, a statistically significant positive association was found with 
      PFOA (OR:1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39) and PFHxS (OR:1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.29). Among 
      various phthalates analysed only mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP, OR:1.37, 95% CI: 
      1.11, 1.70) showed an association with GH. From our analysis, bisphenol A 
      exposure during pregnancy did not show a significant association with the risk of 
      PE. Our findings indicated that exposure to PFASs such as PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA 
      during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of PE and PFOA and PFHxS 
      with GH. We also found that MEP was associated with GH. Most of the results were 
      unstable in sensitivity analysis. Since most of these associations have limited 
      evidence, more research is needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - The effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances on female fertility: 
      A systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The reproductive toxicity of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
      substances (PFAS) has been verified in both animal and in vitro experiments, 
      however, the association between PFAS and female fertility remains contradictory 
      in population studies. Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we 
      evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence. 
      METHODS: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, 
      and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect 
      observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators 
      independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the 
      risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R 
      software. RESULTS: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully 
      met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid 
      (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds 
      ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (Cl) [0.78; 0.98]) and positively 
      associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95%Cl [1.03; 1.73]). 
      Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure was negatively associated with the 
      fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.90; 0.98]). Pooled effect values 
      for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and 
      perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) exposure did not find sufficient evidence for 
      an association with female fertility. CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence provided 
      by the current study, increased levels of PFAS exposure are associated with 
      reduced fertility in women, this was characterized by a reduction in 
      fecundability odds ratio and an increase in odds ratio for infertility. This 
      finding could partially explain the decline in female fertility and provide 
      insight into risk assessment when manufacturing products containing PFAS.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread pollutants that may 
      impact youth adiposity patterns. We investigated cross-sectional associations 
      between PFAS and body mass index (BMI) in teenagers/adolescents across nine 
      European countries within the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. 
      We used data from 1957 teenagers (12-18 yrs) that were part of the HBM4EU aligned 
      studies, consisting of nine HBM studies (NEBII, Norway; Riksmaten Adolescents 
      2016-17, Sweden; PCB cohort (follow-up), Slovakia; SLO CRP, Slovenia; CROME, 
      Greece; BEA, Spain; ESTEBAN, France; FLEHS IV, Belgium; GerES V-sub, Germany). 
      Twelve PFAS were measured in blood, whilst weight and height were measured by 
      field nurse/physician or self-reported in questionnaires. We assessed 
      associations between PFAS and age- and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores using linear and 
      logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Random-effects 
      meta-analysis and mixed effects models were used to pool studies. We assessed 
      mixture effects using molar sums of exposure biomarkers with 
      toxicological/structural similarities and quantile g-computation. In all studies, 
      the highest concentrations of PFAS were PFOS (medians ranging from 1.34 to 
      2.79 μg/L). There was a tendency for negative associations with BMI z-scores for 
      all PFAS (except for PFHxS and PFHpS), which was borderline significant for the 
      molar sum of [PFOA and PFNA] and significant for single PFOA [β-coefficient (95% 
      CI) per interquartile range fold change = -0.06 (-0.17, 0.00) and -0.08 (-0.15, 
      -0.01), respectively]. Mixture assessment indicated similar negative associations 
      of the total mixture of [PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS] with BMI z-score, but not 
      all compounds showed associations in the same direction: whilst [PFOA, PFNA and 
      PFOS] were negatively associated, [PFHxS] associated positively with BMI z-score. 
      Our results indicated a tendency for associations of relatively low PFAS 
      concentrations with lower BMI in European teenagers. More prospective research is 
      needed to investigate this potential relationship and its implications for health 
      later in life.

TI  - Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure and risk of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
      (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the etiology of diabetes. 
      OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological 
      evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and 
      to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing 
      literature. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological 
      studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds 
      ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or β and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
      respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes 
      using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses 
      were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the 
      studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. RESULTS: An initial 
      literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually 
      included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant 
      PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations 
      were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. 
      Dose-response meta-analysis showed a "parabolic-shaped" association between 
      perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was 
      rated with "low" risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident 
      T2DM was considered "moderate". CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PFAS 
      exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert 
      non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread 
      exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further 
      cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the 
      covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, 
      are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of 
      action of different PFAS on diabetes. IMPACT STATEMENT: A growing body of 
      evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine 
      disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, 
      epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is 
      inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis 
      to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest 
      that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population. 
      Reduced exposure to these "forever and everywhere chemicals" may be an important 
      preventative approach to reducing the risk of diabetes across the population.

AB  - Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a collective name for approximately 
      4700 synthetic chemicals ubiquitous in the aquatic environment worldwide. They 
      are used in a wide array of products and are found in living organisms around the 
      world. Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, 
      endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are 
      currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic 
      organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS 
      on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 
      13.5 μg/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. 
      However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on 
      fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research 
      gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at 
      environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies have been performed on 
      secondary consumers and there is a substantial lack of studies on other consumers 
      in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used synthetic aliphatic 
      compounds. This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human 
      populations. METHOD: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, 
      Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language 
      articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were 
      also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 
      years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS 
      concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or 
      whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations 
      and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by 
      vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and 
      lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests 
      were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between 
      positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by 
      separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of 
      perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality 
      was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. 
      RESULTS: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that 
      PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, 
      particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between 
      PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid 
      (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary 
      outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol 
      concentrations. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of associations between the 
      concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research 
      should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on 
      human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking. (300

AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted of published literature reporting concentrations of 
      per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater for sites distributed 
      in 20 countries across the globe. Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 
      reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 
      21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as 
      non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, 
      from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are 
      observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. 
      Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and 
      perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the 
      two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is ~15 mg/L 
      reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum 
      reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to 
      concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and 
      precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those 
      reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point 
      for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally 
      significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The 
      presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including 
      areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the 
      existence of a "background" concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in 
      both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background 
      is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and 
      the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional 
      and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to 
      significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many 
      regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders 
      concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health.

TI  - Human Evidence of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposure on Hepatic Disease: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191811318 [doi]
LID - 11318
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used throughout different 
      industries, including the food industry, because it is resistant to heat and 
      prevents water or oil from easily permeating into or contaminating materials 
      coated by PFOA. Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA 
      exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate 
      because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and 
      hepatic diseases. METHODS: This study searched studies related to hepatic 
      diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and 
      Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis 
      through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and 
      risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate 
      literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies 
      were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The results of the meta-analysis 
      showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of 
      those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% 
      CI, 1.086-1.254). CONCLUSION: However, since the number of studies included in 
      the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated 
      with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed 
      to confirm its long-term effects.

AB  - Investigation of the toxicity triggered by chemicals on the human brain has 
      traditionally relied on approaches using rodent in vivo models and in vitro cell 
      models including primary neuronal cultures and cell lines from rodents. The 
      issues of species differences between humans and rodents, the animal ethical 
      concerns and the time and cost required for neurotoxicity studies on in vivo 
      animal models, do limit the use of animal-based models in neurotoxicology. In 
      this context, human cell models appear relevant in elucidating cellular and 
      molecular impacts of neurotoxicants and facilitating prioritization of in vivo 
      testing. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC® CRL-2266™) is one of 
      the most used cell lines in neurosciences, either undifferentiated or 
      differentiated into neuron-like cells. This review presents the characteristics 
      of the SH-SY5Y cell line and proposes the results of a systematic review of 
      literature on the use of this in vitro cell model for neurotoxicity research by 
      focusing on organic environmental pollutants including pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 
      8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), flame retardants, PFASs, parabens, 
      bisphenols, phthalates, and PAHs. Organic environmental pollutants are widely 
      present in the environment and increasingly known to cause clinical neurotoxic 
      effects during fetal & child development and adulthood. Their effects on cultured 
      SH-SY5Y cells include autophagy, cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, 
      or necrosis), increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption 
      of neurotransmitter homeostasis, and alteration of neuritic length. Finally, the 
      inherent advantages and limitations of the SH-SY5Y cell model are discussed in 
      the context of chemical testing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been associated with kidney 
      cancer in human studies. METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of two large 
      studies of PFOA and renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common type of kidney 
      cancer); one from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (324 cases and controls), 
      and a second from the C8 Science Panel (103 cases and 511 controls). Serum PFOA 
      levels were estimated a median of 8 years before diagnosis. Analyses were 
      conducted via conditional logistic regression. Lifetime risk of kidney cancer per 
      unit serum PFOA concentration and per unit dose were calculated. RESULTS: The 
      25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of serum PFOA levels were 4.8, 7.3, and 
      23.9 ng/ml for the pooled analysis. The preferred model for the pooled datawas a 
      two-piece linear spline model (knot at 12.5 ng/ml serum PFOA); the log odds of 
      RCC increased 0.1349 per 1 ng/ml increase in serum PFOA up to the knot (eg, an OR 
      of 2.02 (1.45-2.80) from the median to the knot), and was flat thereafter. The 
      estimated lifetime excess risk (cancer slope factor) with an exposure of 1 ng/ml 
      was 0.0018, similar to the excess risk of 0.0026 recently reported by CalEPA 
      based on different methods. Assuming a serum half-life of 2.3 years and a 
      distribution volume of 170 ml/kg for PFOA, our results are equivalent to 0.0128 
      per ng/kg/d of PFOA intake. To limit excess lifetime kidney cancer risk to 
      1/1,000,000, our data suggest a limit of 0.0015 ng/L (0.0015 ppt) for PFOA in 
      drinking water, similar to CalEPA's proposed Public Health Goal and the new US 
      EPA Drinking Water Health Advisory. CONCLUSIONS: Our results correspond 
      reasonably well with cancer slope factors developed by other investigators using 
      published summary data, and suggest drinking water limits similar to new 
      recommendations by the US EPA.

AB  - Despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per- and 
      polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), continued human and ecological exposure to 
      PFAS has led to concerns about historical releases. Municipal wastewater 
      treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the 
      environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed 
      publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 
      21 countries, for which some or all of five perfluorinated carboxylic acids 
      (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta 
      analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not 
      been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 
      2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations 
      of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. 
      Although legacy compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and 
      perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured 
      concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. 
      Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not 
      changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in 
      wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11% to 37% per year. In 
      addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous 
      wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic 
      product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also 
      confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the 
      PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) 
      effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component 
      to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few 
      studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to 
      suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can 
      contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.

AB  - Vaccines are essential for children to defend against infection. Per- and 
      polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the 
      characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the 
      function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We 
      aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological 
      studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine 
      antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in 
      healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, 
      and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum 
      vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential 
      information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression 
      coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence 
      intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive 
      analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were 
      evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our 
      inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of 
      breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to 
      perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated 
      with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test 
      (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively 
      associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This 
      comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on 
      children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some 
      consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS 
      and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, 
      rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few 
      studies are available. Further studies are needed to validate the possible 
      associations.

TI  - Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography vs endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary 
      drainage: A systematic review.
PG  - 3514-3523
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v28.i27.3514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is a diagnostic and 
      therapeutic procedure that involves inserting a needle into the biliary tree, 
      followed by the immediate insertion of a catheter. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided 
      biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is a novel technique that allows BD by echoendoscopy 
      and fluoroscopy using a stent from the biliary tree to the gastrointestinal 
      tract. AIM: To compare the technical aspects and outcomes of percutaneous 
      transhepatic BD (PTBD) and EUS-BD. METHODS: Different databases, including 
      PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane library, Scopus, and Google 
      Scholar, were searched according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses to obtain studies comparing PTBD and 
      EUS-BD. RESULTS: Among the six studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 
      PTBD patients underwent significantly more reinterventions (4.9 vs 1.3), 
      experienced more postprocedural pain (4.1 vs 1.9), and experienced more late 
      adverse events (53.8% vs 6.6%) than EUS-BD patients. There was a significant 
      reduction in the total bilirubin levels in both the groups (16.4-3.3 μmol/L and 
      17.2-3.8 μmol/L for EUS-BD and PTBD, respectively; P = 0.002) at the 7-d 
      follow-up. There were no significant differences observed in the complication 
      rates between PTBD and EUS-BD (3.3 vs 3.8). PTBD was associated with a higher 
      adverse event rate than EUS-BD in all the procedures, including reinterventions 
      (80.4% vs 15.7%, respectively) and a higher index procedure (39.2% vs 18.2%, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review revealed that 
      EUS-BD is linked with a higher rate of effective BD and a more manageable 
      procedure-related adverse event profile than PTBD. These findings highlight the 
      evidence for successful EUS-BD implementation.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in the environment and 
      often ingested with food. PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health 
      consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great 
      importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS 
      concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental 
      studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five 
      variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon 
      chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid 
      cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes 
      (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 
      10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS 
      concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our 
      multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS 
      concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high 
      (I(2) = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed 
      heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue 
      ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were 
      associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of 
      different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of 
      cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS 
      concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is 
      important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long 
      cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the 
      impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is 
      lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. 
      However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to 
      reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and 
      techniques.

AB  - Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent 
      environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their 
      potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies 
      have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of 
      metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this 
      study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association 
      between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy 
      using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for 
      relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical 
      relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where 
      there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were 
      reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random 
      effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q 
      test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population 
      and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association 
      between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general 
      population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) 
      and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid 
      (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant 
      association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the 
      overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence 
      of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the 
      risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of 
      evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to 
      limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be 
      interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to 
      evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and 
      their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in 
      different settings.

AB  - Human ingestion of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated 
      food and water is linked to the development of several cancers, birth defects and 
      other illnesses. The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound 
      (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. 
      However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, 
      power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits 
      understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work 
      summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction 
      mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and 
      product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis 
      showed that mid-high frequency (100 - 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are 
      similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 - 
      100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well 
      understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments 
      suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the 
      bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps 
      toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete 
      stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 
      and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H(2) as a reaction 
      product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are 
      derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel 
      perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition 
      between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 - 
      40 µM. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 - 500 kHz), concentration 
      (>15 - 40 μM), temperature (≈20 °C), and pH range (3.2 - 4) for rapid PFOX 
      degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for 
      the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied 
      power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F(-) is shown to 
      be rate enhancing, while SO(4)(2-) and CO(2) by products are theorised to be rate 
      limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown 
      to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in 
      order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has 
      low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g(-1) PFAS). It is concluded that 
      sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a 
      treatment train for improved efficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to 
      estimate the relationship between endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), 
      including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), poly-brominated diphenyl ethers 
      (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 
      exposure and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Relevant 
      studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching 
      EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that 
      reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM 
      were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by 
      I(2) statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. 
      Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the 
      incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was 
      found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). 
      PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, 
      with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% 
      CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were 
      considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 
      (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for 
      PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% 
      CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The 
      Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses 
      did not change the results in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: These results 
      support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, 
      increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and 
      mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and 
      biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because 
      the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.

TI  - Systematic Evidence Map for Over One Hundred and Fifty Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl 
      Substances (PFAS).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of 
      synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial 
      processes. Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. 
      Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
      (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the 
      challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic 
      evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of 
      PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and 
      animal bioassay evidence for a set of  ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 
      by the U.S. EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in 
      vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review 
      methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and 
      machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes 
      (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and 
      epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety 
      of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model 
      systems; exposure measurement-only studies in humans; and absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology 
      studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and 
      health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with  ≥ 21-d 
      exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful 
      to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data 
      extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive 
      visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were 
      identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal 
      and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 
      50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. 
      Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the 
      reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune 
      systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the 
      reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. 
      Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. 
      DISCUSSION: Many of the  ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal 
      evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By 
      disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work 
      by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research 
      needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete 
      understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures.

AB  - Plastic, paper and cardboard are widely used as food contact materials (FCMs), 
      due to its numerous favourable characteristics. However, they are usually coated 
      with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances 
      (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can 
      migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There 
      are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the 
      environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in 
      the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release 
      of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the 
      environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, 
      migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of 
      PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the 
      PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their 
      desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of 
      various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the 
      PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence 
      their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the 
      current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks 
      associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs.

TI  - Exposure to per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Markers of Liver Injury: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 46001
LID - 10.1289/EHP10092 [doi]
LID - 046001
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence indicates that exposure to certain pollutants 
      is associated with liver damage. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are 
      persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and 
      bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and 
      meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent 
      and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all 
      studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using 
      keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, 
      results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following 
      indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic 
      fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human 
      studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a 
      weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of 
      associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively 
      summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 
      85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the 
      United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid 
      (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and 
      perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher 
      ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score =  6.20, p < 0.001), 
      PFOS (z-score =  3.55, p < 0.001), and PFNA (z-score =  2.27, p = 0.023). PFOA 
      exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and 
      gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures 
      consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is 
      consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by 
      associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human 
      studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating 
      next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures.

TI  - Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor 
      media: A systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been 
      primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is 
      information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential 
      environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and 
      human biomonitoring measurements. METHODS: This study adapts existing systematic 
      review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways 
      from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, 
      cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were 
      identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific 
      search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The 
      included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified 
      specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following 
      a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the 
      systematic review methodology used in detail. RESULTS: Only 7 studies were 
      identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant 
      household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from 
      the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a 
      percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the 
      indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, 
      PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 
      25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could 
      account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum 
      PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant 
      profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher 
      socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated 
      contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic 
      review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study 
      populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major 
      research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor 
      exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on 
      exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals.

TI  - How to investigate human health effects related to exposure to mixtures of per- 
      and polyfluoroalkyl substances: A systematic review of statistical methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
      (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. 
      Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent 
      years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be 
      used to assess their combined effect on human health. OBJECTIVES: We aim to 
      perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing 
      studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and 
      any adverse human health effect. METHODS: The online databases PubMed, Embase and 
      Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years 
      (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two 
      different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full 
      text revision of the selected papers. RESULTS: A total of 3640 papers were 
      identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the 
      current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were 
      conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 
      out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) 
      Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 
      53 papers to model mixtures' effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are 
      immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), 
      reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to 
      metabolic pathways (n = 16). CONCLUSION: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as 
      complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last 
      few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS 
      mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of 
      constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for 
      quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are 
      warranted.

LID - 855348
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large body of emerging evidence suggests that per- and 
      polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) affect birth outcomes in various pathways, but 
      the evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically 
      review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. METHODS: 
      Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through 
      February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome 
      indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The 
      risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each 
      exposure-outcome pair were assessed. RESULTS: The initial search identified 58 
      potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS 
      were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations 
      with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, 
      with effect sizes ranging from -181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = 
      -360.620 to -1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to 
      -24.252 g (95% CI = -38.574 to -9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in 
      perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS 
      and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate 
      (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and 
      perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with 
      gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm 
      birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association 
      with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each 
      exposure-outcome pair was considered to be "moderate". CONCLUSION: This study 
      showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of 
      various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had 
      different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm 
      our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different 
      types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and 
      fully considering the possible confounders.

      appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of 
      GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to 
      heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, 
      blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, 
      sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted 
      to explore the robustness of the results. RESULTS: A total of eight studies 
      involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. 
      Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly 
      associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59). Exposure to other 
      types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane 
      sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically 
      significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 
      0.97 (95% CI: 0.86-1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86-1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55-1.16) 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the 
      association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was 
      significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great 
      significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further 
      studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential 
      mechanism.

AB  - Although previous meta-analyses have shown that prenatal PFASs exposure is 
      associated with reduction in birth weight, effects of prenatal PFASs exposure on 
      birth outcomes have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta-analysis of 23 
      eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science before March 
      21, 2021 to analyze the association between prenatal PFASs exposure and birth 
      outcomes, including premature birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for 
      gestational age (SGA) and miscarriage. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 
      confidence intervals were extracted for analysis. According to the heterogeneity 
      of the included studies, fixed-effects (I(2) ≤ 50%) and random-effects 
      (I(2) > 50%) models were applied respectively. The significant associations 
      between PFOS and PTB (pooled OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.20-1.98), PFOA and miscarriage 
      (pooled OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15-1.70), and PFOS and LBW (pooled OR = 1.52, 95% 
      CI: 1.19-1.94) were obtained. There were differences between included studies 
      with different study regions, sampling time, and samples type used for PFASs 
      assessment. These findings may provide insight in risk assessment and 
      decision-making in producing products that contain PFASs.

TI  - The transplacental transfer efficiency of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
      (PFAS): a first meta-analysis.
PG  - 23-42
LID - 10.1080/10937404.2021.2009946 [doi]
AB  - Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the 
      environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be 
      distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and 
      functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on 
      PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a 
      meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to 
      April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS 
      assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the 
      systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included 
      in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for 
      quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear 
      relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids 
      (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. 
      Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 
      fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out 
      the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional 
      group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the 
      human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women 
      and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure.
