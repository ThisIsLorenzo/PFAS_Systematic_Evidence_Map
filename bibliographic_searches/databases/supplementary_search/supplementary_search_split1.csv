NA,Pollution pathways and release estimation of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in central and eastern China.,2017,NA,NA,"China has gradually become the most important manufacturing and consumption centre for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the world, and inadvertently become the world's major contamination hotspots. However, a systematic analysis of pollution pathways for PFOS/PFOA into the different environmental compartments and their quantification in China has yet to be carried out. This study focused on PFOS and PFOA release into the environment in the central and eastern region of China, which accounts for the vast majority of national emission. About 80-90% of PFOS/PFOA contamination in the Chinese environment was estimated to come directly from manufacturing and industrial sites mostly via wastewater discharge from these facilities. The other major contamination sources for PFOS were identified as being linked to aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), and pesticides including sulfluramid. For PFOA, following some way behind industrial wastewater, were industrial exhaust gas, domestic wastewater and landfill leachate as contamination sources. For surface water contamination, the major pollution contributors after industrial wastewater were AFFF spill runoff for PFOS, and domestic wastewater and precipitation-runoff for PFOA. The majority of PFOS that contaminated soil was considered to be linked with infiltration of AFFF and pesticides, while most PFOA in soil was attributed to atmospheric deposition and landfill leachate. Where groundwater had become contaminated, surface water seepage was estimated to contribute about 50% of PFOS and 40% of PFOA while the remainder was mostly derived from soil leaching. A review of the available monitoring data for PFOS/PFOA in the literature supported the view that industrial wastewater, landfill leachate and AFFF application were the dominant sources. Higher concentrations of PFOA than PFOS found in precipitation also corroborated the prediction of more PFOA release into air. To reduce PFOS/PFOA contamination of the Chinese environment the focus for control should be on industrial wastewater emissions.",NA

Since the 1990s, the aluminum industry has made considerable progress in reducing PFCs from conventionally defined and detected AEs. However in recent years, the industry has noted the presence of unaccounted PFCs that are generated outside the conventional AE definition. Two additional AE categories have been proposed, namely low-voltage, propagating AEs (LVP-AEs) and nonpropagating AEs (NP-AEs) that relate to continuous, background levels of PFC emissions. These unaccounted PFC phenomena may help explain the recent discrepancy between industry accounting and atmospheric measurements of global PFC emissions. Estimates from AGAGE, a global network of atmospheric observatories, suggest as much as 50% underaccounting of PFCs by the aluminum industry in the 2006–2010 period. The following work reviews this discrepancy and the potential role played by LVP-AEs and NP-AEs. © 2015, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",Aluminum plants; Electrodes; Greenhouse gases; Ore reduction; Aluminum industry; Aluminum reduction cells; Anode effects; Atmospheric measurement; Background level; Carbon compounds; Global networks; Low voltages; Aluminum

Emerging research has revealed the preferential accumulation of PFASs in shallow soil horizons, particularly at sites impacted by firefighting activities, agricultural applications, and atmospheric deposition. Once in the vadose zone, PFASs can sorb to soil, accumulate at interfaces, become volatilized, be taken up in biota, or leach to the underlying aquifer. At the same time, polyfluorinated precursor species may transform into highly recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl acids, changing their chemical identity and thus transport behavior along the way. In this review, we critically discuss the current state of the knowledge and aim to interconnect the complex processes that control the fate and transport of PFASs in the vadose zone.

Among them, short-chain PFAS are of increasing concern due to their high solubility and mobility in water, while possessing persistency and toxicity nature like their longer-chain analogs. The most common method for PFAS removal from water is by sorption with activated carbons or ion exchange resins, but these adsorbents only exhibit limited removal efficiency against short-chain PFAS, and they require frequent replacement leading to high operational cost. Here we review and discuss the potential of using bio-adsorbents, which can be derived from common biomass feedstocks, as low-cost alternatives to traditional adsorbents, while these materials can also possess good removal efficiency against short-chain PFAS. We further provide the perspective on the designs of low-cost, activated bio-adsorbent systems that can be implemented for effective removal of short-chain PFAS. © 2021 The Authors.

Sediment is an important environmental reservoir for PFOA, while polluted sediment can serve as a long-term contamination source causing pollution to overlying surface water and surrounding groundwater. Here, the source, pollution level, adsorption and transport of PFOA at the sediment-water interface were systematically reviewed. Industrial discharge was the major release for PFOA entering surface water and sediment. PFOA was generally at ng•L-1 and ng•g-1 levels in global surface water and sediment. More serious pollution was found in some parts of China. Sediment composition, hadrochemical condition, natural organic matter, and surfactants could strongly affect PFOA adsorption in sediment, though the controlling mechanisms were controversial. Research on PFOA transport in sediment had just been started with limited progress. There is a great gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying PFOA transport in sediment, which should be strengthened in the future. © 2021, Science Press.

Consequently, complement system dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in disorders of neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Rett syndrome. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal relationship between impaired complement regulation and these disorders varies depending on the disease involved. Also, it is still unclear to what extent altered complement expression plays a role in these disorders through inflammation-independent or -dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in specific complement components have been implicated in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder.

Given this threat to living organisms, we carried out a broad review of possible sources of PFASs and their potential accumulation in agricultural plants, from where they can transfer to humans through the food chain. Analysis of the literature indicates a direct correlation between PFAS concentrations in soil and bioaccumulation in plants. Furthermore, plant uptake largely changes with chain length, functional group, plant species and organ. Low accumulations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) have been found in peeled potatoes and cereal seeds, while short-chain compounds can accumulate at high levels in leafy vegetables and fruits. Significant variations in PFAS buildup in plants according to soil amendment are also found, suggesting a particular interaction with soil organic matter.

The etiology of T1D is not fully understood but it seems multifactorial. The genetic background determines the predisposition to develop T1D, while the autoimmune process against β-cells seems to be also determined by environmental triggers, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Environmental EDCs may act throughout different temporal windows as single chemical agent or as chemical mixtures. They could affect the development and the function of the immune system or of the β-cells function, promoting autoimmunity and increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune attack. Human studies evaluating the potential role of exposure to EDCs on the pathogenesis of T1D are few and demonstrated contradictory results. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize experimental and epidemiological studies on the potential role of exposure to EDCs in the development of T1D. We highlight what we know by animals about EDCs’ effects on mechanisms leading to T1D development and progression. Studies evaluating the EDC levels in patients with T1D were also reported.

They have been detected ubiquitously in ambient water along with other environmental matrices, and their adverse effects on aquatic organisms have been a subject of active investigation. Here, we intended to summarize and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PFAA toxicity through an extensive literature review, and shed light on areas where further research is warranted. PFAA toxicity appears to be influenced by the sex and developmental stages of aquatic organisms, but not significantly by exposure route. PFAA-induced aquatic toxicity could be classified as metabolism disturbance, reproduction disruption, oxidative stress, developmental toxicity, thyroid disruption, etc. At the molecular level, these responses can be initiated by key events, such as nuclear receptor activation, reactive oxygen species induction, or interaction with a membrane, followed by a cascade of downstream responses. PFAA-induced toxicity involves diverse metabolic processes, and therefore elucidating crosstalk or interactions among diverse metabolic pathways is a challenging task. In the presence of other chemicals, PFAAs can function as agonists or antagonists, resulting in different directions of combined toxicity. Therefore, mixture toxicity with other groups of chemicals is another research opportunity. Experimental evidence supports the trans-generational toxicity of PFAAs, suggesting that their long-term consequences for aquatic ecosystems should become of concern. A recent global ban of several PFAAs resulted in an increasing dependence on PFAA alternatives. The lack of sufficient toxicological information on this emerging group of chemicals warrant caution and rigorous toxicological assessments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Cell proliferation; Chemicals; Consumer products; Metabolism; Molecular oxygen; Oxidative stress; Toxicity; Aquatic toxicity; Lipid metabolisms; PFAA; Reproductive toxicities; Xenobiotic response; Aquatic organisms; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; aquatic organism; chemical pollutant; fish; lipid; metabolism; oxidative stress; pollution effect; reproductive behavior; toxicity; xenobiotics; aquatic environment; aquatic species; developmental stage; developmental toxicity; downstream processing; evidence based medicine; fish; metabolic disorder; molecular interaction; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; Review; sex; synthesis; toxicity; animal; aquatic species; ecosystem; sea food; water pollutant; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Ecosystem; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Seafood; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Syngas-to-aromatics (STA) is a very promising approach for the synthesis of aromatic monomers, and is catalyzed via bifunctional catalysts in a single reactor, wherein methanol/dimethyl ether and/or olefins intermediates formed from syngas on metal components are converted into aromatic monomers exclusively on the HZSM-5 by cascade reactions. Since an optimal Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) temperature of Fe-based catalysts is very close to an aromatization temperature of HZSM-5, Fe-based catalysts have been frequently used/modified for the synthesis of aromatic monomers from hydrogenation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2). The nature of metal components and amounts of Brönsted acid sites on HZSM-5, and their mesoporosity and intimacy, significantly alter the selectivity for aromatics by tuning BTX distibution and catalyst stability. Although many developments have been achieved regarding the STA process in recent years, no reviews have been published in this flourishing research area over the last two decades.

Hole- and electron-injection barriers can be effectively lowered by the insertion of hole-transport and electron-injection layers, respectively. The recent development of PFs with various emission colors, via physical blending or chemical modification, are presented for a comprehensive understanding of PFs for device applications.

This study presents a comprehensive review of the research efforts related to the occurrence, fate, health effects and impacts of emerging pollutants on advanced drinking water treatment and the environmental performance evaluation of different technological options, with a focus on pilot and full-scale installations. All presented case studies consider pollutants removed, process conditions and removal efficiencies, thus making possible comparisons between membrane processes, advanced oxidation processes and adsorption on activated carbon and other materials. The study is completed by an analysis of the environmental assessment instruments (life cycle assessment, carbon, water footprints, other type of assessments) that may be used for selecting sustainable advanced drinking water treatment processes able to remove emerging pollutants. This paper critically reviews the main research topics concerning emerging pollutants: classification, legislative framework, up-to-date removal processes and their environmental performances assessment, to offer a comprehensive analysis of the strategic issues that may constitute future research directions for sustainable water supply. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Potable water; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water supply; Assessments; Emerging; Environmental; Pollutants; Priority; Water pollution

Recently, Brillouin scattering, which is one of the most significant nonlinear effects in optical fibers, has been successfully observed in PFGI-POFs at 1.55-μm wavelength. The Brillouin Stokes signal was, however, not large enough for practical applications or for detailed investigations of the Brillouin properties. In this paper, we review our recent work on Stokes signal enhancement. First, we induce stimulated Brillouin scattering based on the so-called pump-probe technique, and discuss its applicability to temperature sensors. Then, we investigate the influence of the core diameter and length of PFGI-POFs on Stokes signal, and observe the Brillouin linewidth narrowing effect. We believe our work is an important technological step toward the implementation of practical Brillouin-based devices and systems including distributed strain and temperature sensors. © 2014 by the authors.",NA

Two major PFA subclasses are the perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior for the linear PFA members are poorly understood and widely debated. Even less is known about the numerous branched congeners with varying perfluoroalkyl chain lengths, leading to confounding issues around attempts to constrain the properties of PFAs. Current computational methods are not adequate for reliable multimedia modeling efforts and risk assessments. These compounds are widely present in surface, ground, marine, and drinking waters at concentrations that vary from pg L- 1 to g L- 1. Concentration gradients of up to several orders of magnitude are observed in all types of aquatic systems and reflect proximity to known industrial sources concentrated near populated regions. Some wastewaters contain PFAs at mg L- 1 to low g L- 1 levels, or up to 10 orders of magnitude higher than present in more pristine receiving waters. With the exception of trifluoroacetic acid, which is thought to have both significant natural and anthropogenic sources, all PFSAs and PFCAs are believed to arise from human activities. Filtration and sorption technologies offer the most promising existing removal methods for PFAs in aqueous waste streams, although sonochemical approaches hold promise. Additional studies need to be conducted to better define opportunities from evaporative, extractive, thermal, advanced oxidative, direct and catalyzed photochemical, reductive, and biodegradation methods. Most PFA treatment methods exhibit slow kinetic profiles, hindering their direct application in conventional low hydraulic residence time systems.","Partitioning behavior; Perfluorinated acids; Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids; Physicochemical property; Sulfonic acid; Treatment methods; Water and wastewater; Biodegradation; Biological water treatment; Carboxylic acids; Impurities; Multimedia systems; Organic acids; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sorption; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; carboxylic acid; drinking water; ground water; lake water; perfluorinated sulfonic acid; perfluoro compound; sea water; surface water; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; well water; acidity; activated sludge; aquatic environment; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; biodegradation; catalysis; chemical structure; China; computer model; concentration (parameters); decomposition; detoxification; evaporation; filtration; Indian Ocean; ion exchange; Japan; land drainage; landfill; liquid liquid extraction; Mediterranean Sea; melting point; Pacific Ocean; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; reduction kinetics; review; risk assessment; solubility; swimming pool; temperature dependence; vapor pressure; waste water; water treatment; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fatty Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Micelles; Solubility; Volatilization; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water; Water Purification; Water Supply"

Extremely weakly coordinating anions based on perfluorophenyl borates allow the synthesis and structural characterization of complexes in which cation-anion interactions are minimized. The metals are therefore able to coordinate weakly donating ligands without the structural distortions and limitations in coordination geometry that are always encountered when coordinating anions are present. This has led to the isolation of thallium mono-, bis- and tris-arene complexes, thallium-ferrocene multidecker structures and the determination of their bond energies. New types of ether and crown ether adducts, as well as the first examples of cationic alkylzinc derivatives have become similarly accessible. These ionic Zn compounds very effectively polymerize cyclic esters and epoxides. Arene coordination is also a feature of strongly Lewis acidic bis(perfluoroaryl)zinc compounds, which when combined with activated alkyl chlorides provide an excellent new type of initiator for the homo and copolymerization of isoalkenes. These systems have given rise to a new family of elastomer materials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA

In particular, VRFBs offer a higher power and energy density than other RFBs and mitigate undesirable performance fading, such as inevitable ion crossover, because of the unique advantage that only the vanadium ion is employed as the active species in the two electrolytes. Description: The key constituent of VRFBs is a separator to conduct protons and prevent cross-mixing of the positive and negative electrolytes. For this purpose, ion exchange membranes like sulfonated polymer membranes can be used. Although this type of membrane does not have ion exchange groups, it can achieve an ion exchange capacity by the formation of pores.

The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of PFASs affect the sorption behaviour and suggest organic carbon may not be the only factor affecting sorption. We reviewed the quality of all data published in peer-reviewed literature on sorption of PFASs to critically evaluate the role organic carbon (OC) and other properties have in sorption of PFASs in soils or sediments. The largest data sets available were for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, n = 147) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, n = 178), and these analyses showed very weak correlations between sorption coefficient (Kd) and OC alone (R2 = 0.05–0.07). When only laboratory-derived Kd values of PFASs and OC were analysed, the R2 values increased for PFOA (R2 = 0.24, n = 42), PFOS (R2 = 0.38, n = 69), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, R2 = 0.77 n = 12), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA, R2 = 0.78, n = 13). However, the relationships were heavily skewed by one or two high OC values. Similarly there was no significant relationship between Kd values and pH for PFOS (R2 = 0.06) and PFOA (R2 = 0.07), across a range of environmental pH values. Our analyses showed sorption behaviour of a range of PFASs could not be explained by a single soil or sediment property. Multiple regression models better explained the sorption behaviour of a number of PFASs. Regressions of OC and pH together explained a significant proportion of the variation in Kd values for 9 out of 14 PFASs and 8 of these regressions had ≥10 data points. This review highlighted that at least OC, pH and clay content are properties having significant effect on sorption. There is a clear need for more data and studies with thorough characterisation of soils or sediments to better understand their role in PFASs sorption. Current assessments based on OC alone are likely to be erroneous. © 2018",Organic carbon; pH; Quality control; Regression analysis; Sediments; Soils; Environmental contamination; Hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties; Multiple regression model; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sorption coefficients; Sorption; alkyl group; cation; fluorine derivative; organic carbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; polyfunctional group; unclassified drug; organic carbon; pH; regression analysis; sediment property; soil property; sorption; surfactant; anion exchange; biosorption; cation exchange; chemical analysis; chemical composition; correlational study; desorption; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; ionic strength; pH; priority journal; Review; sediment; soil acidity; soil chemistry; soil pollution; synthesis

Blood type, spatiality, human age, and gender were found to have a strong relationship with PFAS levels in blood samples. The PFAS distribution in urine samples was reported to be associated with the chain length of PFASs and human gender. Urinary excretion was found to be an important pathway of PFAS elimination.

Once these ""normal"" values have been established, the diagnosis of environmental contaminant-mediated ill-health (such as manifestations of sickness, increased mortality, a reduction in population, poor breeding success, abnormal behavior) in an individual bird or in a population could be facilitated by comparing exposure values in the investigation to reference values of the same species in the database. One might then identify the cause and pave the way for a mitigating response. The toxicant component of DABSE is being examined at the low ng ml-1 level in 200 μl of whole blood. As these analyses are invariably very costly, an effort has been made to lower these costs and so enable more testing by quantitating representative compounds as markers for the whole group. These markers are invariably found in birds' blood at the highest concentration of all the constituents in that group.

Due to these substances, hospital wastewater can represent a chemical, biological and physical risk for public and environmental health. In particular, several studies demonstrate that the main effects of these substances can't be neutralised by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). These substances can be found in a wide range of concentrations due to the size of a hospital, the bed density, number of inpatients and outpatients, the number and the type of wards, the number and types of services, the country and the season. Some hazardous substances produced in hospital facilities have a regulatory status and are treated like waste and are disposed of accordingly (i.e., dental amalgam and medications). Legislation is quite homogeneous for these substances in all industrial countries. Problems that have emerged in the last decade concern substances and microorganisms that don't have a regulatory status, such as antibiotic residues, drugs and specific pathogens. At a global level, guidelines exist for treatment methods for these effluents, but legislation in all major industrial countries don't contain limitations on these parameters. Therefore, a monitoring system is necessary for these effluents as well as for substances and pathogens, as these elements can represent a risk to the environment and public health. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","antibiotic agent; hazardous waste; water pollutant; effluent; environmental legislation; environmental risk; guideline; health risk; microbiology; physicochemical property; regulatory framework; waste management; water pollution; dangerous goods; effluent; hospital; human; law; microbiological parameters; nonhuman; practice guideline; Review; risk; waste water; water management; water pollutant; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; European Union; hazardous waste; hospital management; legislation and jurisprudence; microbiology; sewage; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; European Union; Hazardous Waste; Humans; Materials Management, Hospital; Risk; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The reaction mechanisms for the different reaction conditions are discussed. Electron irradiation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with a very high dose leads to a complete degradation of the macromolecules to low-molecular products. In the presence of oxygen perfluorocarboxylic acids and in an inert atmosphere, mixtures of perfluorinated olefins and paraffins can be obtained. Virgin PTFE is disintegrated by high-energy irradiation in air with a lower dose into a micropowder modified with COOH groups. This powder can be homogeneously incorporated in other polymers. So, the special properties of PTFE can be made effective in these polymers. Micropowders functionalized with COOH groups and polyamides (PA) form by reactive extrusion PTFE-PA blockcopolymers which can be used as slide bearing materials. The copolymers poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-perfluoropropyl vinyl ether) (PFA) irradiated in air show a significantly higher degree of COOH functionalization compared with PTFE. Irradiation of molten PTFE in an inert atmosphere leads to formation of different kinds of double bonds, CF3 side groups, long-chain branches as well as cross-links. Irradiation of PFA in vacuum results in the generation of COF and COOH groups; in molten state also branches and cross-links are formed. The focus of the present paper is on the work that has been carried out at the Institute of Polymer Research Dresden. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In Escherichia coli, the key events of this cycle are the initiation of DNA replication, nucleoid segregation and the initiation of cell division. The replication initiator is the DnaA protein. In nucleoid segregation, the MukB protein, required for proper partitioning, may be a member of the myosin‐kinesin superfamily of mechanoenzymes. In cell division, the FtsZ protein has a tubulin motif, is a GTPase and polymerizes in a ring around midcell during septation; the FtsA protein has an actin‐like structure. The nature of the internal signals triggering these events is not known but candidates include cell mass, the superhelical density of the chromosome and the concentration of two regulatory nucleotides, cyclic AMP and ppGpp. The involvement of cytoskeletal‐like proteins in key cycle events encourages the notion of a fundamental biological unity in cell cycle regulation in all organisms.

This contamination comes from domestic sewage, livestock, hospitals and chemical-pharmaceutical industries. Typical examples of these pollutants are the fuoroquinolones - powerful antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. The presence of fuoroquinolones in the environment can pose a serious threat to the ecosystem and to human health due to their high consumption globally: in 1998, around 120 tons were produced. Even at low environmental concentrations, antibiotics stimulate bacterial resistance. The consequences of the presence of fuoroquinolones in the environment are not fully understood, but are known to be toxic to plants and aquatic organisms. Approximately 85% of the fuoroquinolones present in influents can be removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants, but the removed fraction is frequently accumulated in the sludge, which is sometimes used as fertilizer, representing an additional input route into the environment. The removal of fuoroquinolones by biological treatment is ineffective, and it is believed that only advanced oxidation technologies are able to destroy these emerging pollutants.",quinoline derived antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; aquatic environment; bacterium; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; bioremediation; ecotoxicity; fungus; health hazard; microalga; plant; pollution; pollution transport; review; sediment; sewage; sludge; waste water treatment plant

Many countries, especially in remote regional areas, use waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs) to treat domestic wastewater for a variety of end uses, including using the treated wastewater for irrigation of public spaces (e.g. parks and ovals) or for crop irrigation. Thus, it is vital that the resulting effluent meets the required quality for beneficial reuse. In this paper, both the performance of WSPs in the removal of organic micropollutants, and the mechanisms of removal, are reviewed. The performance of WSPs in the removal of organic micropollutants was found to be highly variable and influenced by many factors, such as the type and configuration of the ponds, the operational parameters of the treatment plant, the wastewater quality, environmental factors (e.g. sunlight, temperature, redox conditions and pH) and the characteristics of the pollutant. The removal of organic micropollutants from WSPs has been attributed to biodegradation, photodegradation and sorption processes, the majority of which occur in the initial treatment stages (e.g. in the anaerobic or facultative ponds). Out of the many hundreds of organic micropollutants identified in wastewater, only a limited number (40) have been studied in WSPs, with the majority of these pollutants being pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds. Thus, future research on the fate of organic micropollutants in WSPs should encompass a broader range of micropollutants and include emerging organic pollutants, such as illicit drugs and perfluorinated compounds. Further research is also needed on the formation and toxicity of transformation products from organic micropollutants in WSPs, since the transformation products of some organic micropollutants can be more toxic than the parent compound. Combining other wastewater treatment processes with WSPs for removal of recalcitrant organic micropollutants should also be considered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","endocrine disruptor; organic compound; perfluoro compound; pesticide; biodegradation; developing world; domestic waste; effluent; endocrine disruptor; environmental factor; irrigation; organic pollutant; photodegradation; pollutant removal; pond; PPCP; recycling; sorption; waste treatment; wastewater treatment; adsorption; biodegradation; human; nonhuman; organic pollution; photodegradation; pond; Review; waste component removal; waste stabilization pond; waste water management; pond; sewage; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Ponds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

NLGI Fellowship studies have contributed significantly to this phase. Outstanding advances have also been made in manufacture and processing, giving greater efficiencies, shorter times of manufacturing and culminating in the first truly continuous manufacturing process. Radioactive tracing of additive mixing has been accomplished. Packaging has advanced with new materials, and new ingredients for greases have become available. Inventory and quality control has been marked by the use of computers. Mechanical testing and evaluation has been a major effort in supplementing simple non-bearing bench tests by providing laboratory rig tests using actual bearings and gears. Many new designs of testing equipment have been developed, and studies of the friction, wear and e.p. properties of lubricating greases, including ball joint testing, have been extended. Analysis and non-mechanical testing endeavors have included a critical look at the significance of the bomb oxidation test, the development of an instrumental method to measure color, and the use of infrared techniques for quantitative analysis of lithium soap in lubricating grease. Studies on flow and dispensing have been particularly active resulting in an advanced understanding of grease flow, both theoretical and in practical applications. In particular, apparent viscosity determinations have been correlated with flow in pipes in a very useful way. A continuing development of centralized lubricating systems has made for efficiency, economy and safety, and great expansions in bulk handling have come about through better understanding of grease flow. Formulation of lubricating greases has been marked by development of new thickeners in addition to complex soaps, and in the expanded use of molybdenum disulfide as a solid-film lubricating additive. The development and study of products for extreme environments including aerospace applications has resulted in some industrial spin-off. The new NLGI Reference Systems provide samples of the same formulation and manufacture which can be used for research and evaluation by laboratories with assurance of continuity, this being particularly valuable for co-operative investigations by technical societies. New discoveries have been made with old ingredients, such as the finding that high-soap-content greases give longer ball-bearing lives. A special grease has been formulated for the food industry. The application of lubricating greases and requirements for them have been marked by the development of rustproof applications from the ""inside-out"" rather than simply applying an asphaltic undercoating. The new grease-petrolatum-type products applied mainly with airless sprays have given much better rust protection for the life of the automotive vehicle than was obtained previously. Lubrication intervals for automotive chassis greases have continued to increase, although certain makes of cars have reverted to shorter periods and more grease fittings particularly when conventional greases are used. There has been an intensive development of aerospace applications with special greases such as the perfluorinated types coming into the picture where hard vacuum, high temperatures, and other extreme conditions must be resisted. However, it has been found that more conventional greases may work surprisingly well, not only where sealed against vacuum, but in vacuum environments. Improvements have been made in railroad lubrication particularly in the understanding of the functioning of journal roller bearing greases and effect of vibration on them, and the trend toward mild-e.p.-gear-oil traction-motor gear lubricants which give better heat transfer, resist thickening, and afford improved lubrication of gears. The issuance of a revised NLGI Glossary containing approximately 100 terms now agreed upon in the lubricating grease industry should help the understanding of these products by users and others. The NLGI Grade Classification has been made an American Standard and is being considered for international standardization. Production surveys made periodically by NLGI and recent marketing forecasts have resulted in very helpful statistics and the recognition of trends. Considerable thought has been given to better marketing techniques. © 1970.",LUBRICATING GREASES; TOR; U.S.A; WEARA

Several issues, such as different levels and time of exposure and different action across different ages as well as gender, make the study of endocrine disruptors still a challenge. The thyroid is very sensitive to the action of disruptors, and considering the importance of a correct thyroid function for physical and cognitive functioning, addressing this topic should be considered a priority. In this review, we examined the most recent studies, many of them concentrating on maternal and child exposure, conducted to assess the impact of industrial chemicals which showed an influence on thyroid function. So far, the number of studies conducted on that topic is not sufficient to provide solid conclusions and lead to homogeneous guidelines. The lack of uniformity is certainly due to differences in areas and populations examined, the different conditions of exposures and the remarkable inter-subject variability. Nonetheless, the European Commission for Health and Food Safety is implementing recommendations to ensure that substances identified as endocrine disruptors will be withdrawn from the market. © 2017 by the authors.

This study was aimed at understanding the structural basis of their chain-breaking properties and at designing new compounds with improved antioxidative properties. For this, a series of 2-amino-1,4-pyrazine derivatives and their related imidazolopyrazinones were synthesised and examined for their capacity to inhibit lipid peroxidation in linoleate micelles subjected to the peroxidizing action of AAPH. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the reduction of the peroxidation rate by CLM is mainly determined by the concomitant presence of 5-p-hydroxyphenyl and 2-amino groups in para position. The lipophilic character of substituents also affected this effect. All imidazolopyrazinones induced a lag-time before the onset of the peroxidation process. The hetero-bicyclic imidazolopyrazinone moiety appears as the main contributor to this activity while phenol groups play little role in it. On the other hand, phenol groups were required for the reduction of the peroxidation rate after the lag-phase. The introduction of a supplementary p-hydroxyphenyl substituent at C8 position did not increase chain-breaking properties. The substitution of the C5-P-hydroxyphenyl with a catechol moiety or the introduction of a second amino group on the pyrazine ring yielded the most active compounds, superior to imidazolopyrazinones and reference antioxidants like epigallocatechin gallate, vitamin E and trolox. The strong antioxidant properties of 2,6-diaminopyrazines are not dependent on the presence of hydroxyl groups indicating that their reaction mechanism differs from that of 2-amino-1,4-pyrazine derivatives.","alpha tocopherol; aminopyrazine derivative; antioxidant; catechol; coelenteramine derivative; coelenterazine derivative; epigallocatechin gallate; imidazole derivative; imidazolopyrazinone derivative; linoleic acid; luciferin; phenol derivative; pyrazine derivative; trolox C; unclassified drug; antioxidant activity; bioluminescence; chemical reaction; chemical structure; controlled study; in vitro study; lipid peroxidation; lipophilicity; marine environment; micelle; review; structure activity relation; structure analysis; synthesis; Antioxidants; Imidazoles; Linoleic Acid; Lipid Peroxidation; Micelles; Models, Chemical; Oxygen; Pyrazines; Structure-Activity Relationship; Time Factors"

In this review we provide a summary of current data on maternal and fetal exposure, as well as health consequences from these exposures.

In many archaeal species, however, division is orchestrated differently. The Crenarchaeota phylum of archaea features the action of the three proteins, CdvABC. This Cdv system is a unique and less-well-studied division mechanism that merits closer inspection. In vivo, the three Cdv proteins form a composite band that contracts concomitantly with the septum formation. Of the three Cdv proteins, CdvA is the first to be recruited to the division site, while CdvB and CdvC are thought to participate in the active part of the Cdv division machinery. Interestingly, CdvB shares homology with a family of proteins from the eukaryotic ESCRT-III complex, and CdvC is a homolog of the eukaryotic Vps4 complex. These two eukaryotic complexes are key factors in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, which is responsible for various budding processes in eukaryotic cells and which participates in the final stages of division in Metazoa. There, ESCRT-III forms a contractile machinery that actively cuts the membrane, whereas Vps4, which is an ATPase, is necessary for the turnover of the ESCRT membrane-abscission polymers. In contrast to CdvB and CdvC, CdvA is unique to the archaeal Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota phyla. The Crenarchaeota division mechanism has often been suggested to represent a simplified version of the ESCRT division machinery thus providing a model system to study the evolution and mechanism of cell division in higher organisms. However, there are still many open questions regarding this parallelism and the division mechanism of Crenarchaeota. Here, we review the existing data on the role of the Cdv proteins in the division process of Crenarchaeota as well as concisely review the ESCRT system in eukaryotes. We survey the similarities and differences between the division and abscission mechanisms in the two cases. We suggest that the Cdv system functions differently in archaea than ESCRT does in eukaryotes, and that, unlike the eukaryotic case, the Cdv system's main function may be related to surplus membrane invagination and cell-wall synthesis. © 2018 Caspi and Dekker.",adenosine triphosphatase; cdv protein; ESCRT protein; Gag protein; protein; unclassified drug; abscission; archaeon; bacterial cell wall; biogenesis; cell division; chromosome; Crenarchaeota; crystal structure; cytokinesis; Desulfurococcales; Euryarchaeota; immunofluorescence; metagenomics; Metallosphaera sedula; microbial community; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; protein interaction; protein localization; protein structure; Review; Sulfolobales; Sulfolobus acidocaldarius; Thaumarchaeota; ubiquitination

Infections of the lower female genital tract (FGT) frequently are asymptomatic; thus, they often remain undiagnosed or untreated. If infections are either not resolved or left untreated, chlamydia can ascend to the upper FGT and infect the fallopian tubes (FTs) causing salpingitis that may lead to functional damage of the FTs and tubal factor infertility (TFI). Clinical observations and experimental data have indicated a role for antibodies against C. trachomatis proteins such as the 60-kDa heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60) in the immunopathogenesis of TFI. When released from infected cells, cHSP60 can induce proinflammatory immune responses that may functionally impair the FTs leading to fibrosis and luminal occlusion. Chlamydial pathogenesis of irreversible and permanent tubal damage is a consequence of innate and adaptive host immune responses to ongoing or repeated infections. The extracellular matrix that is regulated by metalloproteinases may also be modified by chlamydial infections of the FGT. This review will highlight protective and pathogenic immune responses to ongoing and repeated chlamydial infections of the FGT. It will also present two recent hypotheses to explain mechanisms that may contribute to FT damage during a C. trachomatis infection.

Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates.

Most importantly, the principles, mathematical derivations, ongoing development and applications of various ECs models in different geographical regions are critically reviewed and discussed.

A Kinetex 2.6 μm C8 100 Å, 150× 4.6 mm column maintained at 30±1 °C was used for the separation, and further, a connection of two core-shell HPLC columns with a total column dimension of 250× 4.6 mm was also applied. The analytes were eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 0.05 M H3PO4/KH 2PO4 (pH = 2.3)-acetonitrile (7:3, v/v), with a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. A liquid-liquid extraction with 1-chlorobutane was used for the sample preparation. The validation of the canertinib analytical method resulted in recoveries in the range of 74-79 % and in relative standard deviation and accuracy lower than 15 %, both for between- and within-batch calculations. A very good linearity in the validated range (5- 10,000 ng/mL) and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 ng/mL were achieved. Peak width, height and peak area of six protein kinase inhibitors analysed with a core-shell column and with a conventional fully porous particle column were compared. The results showed that, for most inhibitors analysed with the core-shell analytical column, the peaks were about two to three times narrower and two to three times higher, with areas that remained almost unchanged.

Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However, the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in this sense. © 2022, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).",Agriculture; Chemical contamination; Consumer products; Contamination; Ecosystems; Food supply; Industrial chemicals; Risk perception; Adverse effect; Consumables; Consumption; Food security; Industrial processs; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Product process; Shorter chains; Fish

Data sources and selection criteria: Relevant original papers and review articles mainly of the English-written literature. Results: Besides their major role in hemostasis and wound healing, blood platelets are involved in immunological reactions. They are not only able to interact with IgG through Fc receptors (FcR), they also react with complement components. This review summarizes interactions of complement with mainly human platelets. Such interactions may occur through complement receptors of the plasma membrane (e. g. C1q receptor, complement receptors 2 and 4), but also in a receptor-independent way including activation of the platelet by the membrane attack complex of complement C5b-9. In addition, activation of complement at the surface of the platelets may be induced after binding of anti-platelet antibodies to membrane glycoproteins (e.g. GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb/IX) or after binding of platelet-nonspecific immune complexes via FcR. Complement activation in turn may be regulated by various means including specific plasma or membrane proteins [e.g. decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), C8-binding protein (C8bp, homologous restriction factor hrf)]. As a further way of self-protection against complement attack, platelets may actively release C5b-9, deposited at the surface as C5b-9-enriched membrane vesicles. Conclusions: Two lines of interaction of platelet with complement can be distinguished. On the one hand, platelets are equipped with membrane proteins which protect them from complement attack against themselves. On the other hand, membrane receptors for activated complement components as well as for IgG are expressed on the surface, which enable the platelet to intervene in immunological reactions. This property varies between platelets of different species and needs further investigation also in view of the platelet as an intersection between immunology and hemostasis.",immunoglobulin G; complement system; human; immunoreactivity; review; thrombocyte

The PPFR is perfectly stable at ambient conditions, but at temperatures above 80 °C undergoes β-scission to generate trifluoromethyl radical. This property can be used to initiate various chain-polymerization or trifluoromethylation reactions. The unique feature of this process, distinguishing it from all other known methods for ·CF3-radical generation, is that the radical is produced under neutral, inert and additive-free conditions. Hopefully, the mild reaction conditions and commercial availability of PPFR will generate research interest for practical applications of this novel perfluorination reagent for fluorination and polymerization processes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",NA

Animal models for liver cancer are powerful tools to reach this goal. Over the past decade, our laboratory has established multiple oncogene transgenic zebrafish lines that can be robustly induced to develop liver cancer. Histolog-ical, transcriptomic and molecular analyses validate the use of these transgenic zebrafish as experimental models for liver cancer. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of our findings with these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models in tumour initiation, oncogene addiction, tumour microenvironment, gender disparity, cancer cachexia, drug screening and others. Induced oncogene expression causes a rapid change of the tumour microenvironment such as inflammatory responses, increased vascularisation and rapid hepatic growth. In several models, histologically-proven carcinoma can be induced within one week of chemical inducer administration. Interest-ingly, the induced liver tumours show the ability to regress when the transgenic oncogene is sup-pressed by the withdrawal of the chemical inducer. Like human liver cancer, there is a strong bias of liver cancer severity in male zebrafish. After long-term tumour progression, liver cancer-bearing zebrafish also show symptoms of cancer cachexia such as muscle-wasting. In addition, the zebrafish models have been used to screen for anti-metastasis drugs as well as to evaluate environmental toxicants in carcinogenesis. These findings demonstrated that these inducible zebrafish liver cancer models provide rapid and convenient experimental tools for further investigation of fundamental cancer biology, with the potential for the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

It is essential for protection against infections and for orchestrating inflammatory responses. Recent studies have also demonstrated contribution of the complement system to several homeostatic processes that are traditionally not considered to be involved in immunity. Thus, complement regulates homeostasis and immunity. However, dysregulation of this system contributes to several pathologies including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Unexpectedly, studies of the last decade have also revealed that complement promotes cancer progression. Since the initial discovery of tumor promoting role of complement, numerous preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated contribution of several complement components to regulation of tumor growth through their direct interactions with the corresponding receptors on tumor cells or through suppression of antitumor immunity. Most of this work, however, focused on a role of complement in regulating growth of primary tumors. Only recently, a few studies showed that complement promotes cancer metastasis through its contribution to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the premetastatic niche. This latter work has shown that complement activation and generation of complement effectors including C5a occur in organs that are target for metastasis prior to arrival of the very first tumor cells. C5a through its interactions with C5a receptor 1 inhibits antitumor immunity by activating and recruiting immunosuppressive cells from the bone marrow to the premetastatic niche and by regulating function and self-renewal of pulmonary tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. These new advancements provide additional evidence for multifaceted functions of complement in cancer. © 2018 Kochanek, Ghouse, Karbowniczek and Markiewski.",calgranulin A; calgranulin B; CD59 antigen; claudin 1; complement; complement component C3b; complement component C4b; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; complement receptor 2; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 10; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; placental growth factor; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; Twist related protein 1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; uvomorulin; vasculotropin A; adaptive immunity; antitumor gene; cancer growth; cancer inhibition; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell motility; cytotoxicity; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exosome; extracellular matrix; homeostasis; human; immune deficiency; inflammation; innate immunity; lung alveolus macrophage; metastasis; nonhuman; Review; tissue regeneration; tumor growth; tumor immunity; tumor promotion; tumor suppressor gene; tumor vascularization; vascularization

This review summarizes the current research progress of zebrafish complement system. The global searching for complement components in genome database, together with published data, has unveiled the existence of all the orthologues of mammalian complement components identified thus far, including the complement regulatory proteins and complement receptors, in zebrafish. Interestingly, zebrafish complement components also display some distinctive features, such as prominent levels of extrahepatic expression and isotypic diversity of the complement components. Future studies should focus on the following issues that would be of special importance for understanding the physiological role of complement components in zebrafish: conclusive identification of complement genes, especially those with isotypic diversity; analysis and elucidation of function and mechanism of complement components; modulation of innate and adaptive immune response by complement system; and unconventional roles of complement-triggered pathways. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; CD59 antigen; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; clusterin; complement; complement component C1q; complement component C2; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor D; complement factor H; mannan binding lectin associated serine proteinase; vitronectin; complement; zebrafish protein; adaptive immunity; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; complement system; enzyme activation; gene identification; innate immunity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; review; zebra fish; animal; complement activation; genetics; immunology; Danio rerio; Mammalia; Adaptive Immunity; Animals; Complement Activation; Complement System Proteins; Immunity, Innate; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins"

Typical water and wastewater treatment processes (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are proven to be largely ineffective, while adsorption with granular activated carbon (GAC) has been the chief option to capture them from aqueous sources followed by incineration. However, this process is time-consuming, and produces additional solid waste and air pollution. Treatment methods for PFOS and PFOA generally follow two routes: (1) removal from source and reduce the risk; (2) degradation. Emerging technologies focusing on degradation are critically reviewed in this contribution. Various processes such as bioremediation, electrocoagulation, foam fractionation, sonolysis, photocatalysis, mechanochemical, electrochemical degradation, beams of electron and plasma have been developed and studied in the past decade to address PFAS crisis. The underlying mechanisms of these PFAS degradation methods have been categorized.

We rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as “moderate” quality and “sufficient” strength. Integration of these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is “known to be toxic” to human reproduction and development based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.Conclusion: We concluded that developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health based on sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and nonhuman mammalian species.

The characteristics of the surface of catalyst support may influence metal-support interactions, which leads to various degrees of metal dispersion and reducibility. Also, these support surface properties may influence the mass transfer of reactants and products at the catalyst active sites and subsequently affects the performance of the catalyst during FTS. Pre-silylated and post-silylated catalysts have been used to study the influence of surface hydrophobicity on the performance of FTS catalysts. The enhancement of FTS activity by hydrophobicity was mainly ascribed to the improved reducibility of metal oxide species.

Adverse pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial in nature and increasing evidence suggests that the pathophysiology behind preterm birth and preeclampsia may be similar—specifically, both of these disorders may involve abnormalities in placental vasculature. A growing body of literature supports that exposure to environmental contaminants in the air, water, soil, and consumer and household products serves as a key factor influencing the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In pregnant women, toxic metals have been detected in urine, peripheral blood, nail clippings, and amniotic fluid. The placenta serves as a “gatekeeper” between maternal and fetal exposures, because it can reduce or enhance fetal exposure to various toxicants. Proposed mechanisms underlying toxicant-mediated damage include disrupted placental vasculogenesis, an up-regulated proinflammatory state, oxidative stressors contributing to prostaglandin production and consequent cervical ripening, uterine contractions, and ruptured membranes and epigenetic changes that contribute to disrupted regulation of endocrine and immune system signaling.

Current deterministic frame-works for risk assessment lack the ability to predict the likelihood of effects and to assess uncertainty. When exposure exceeds tolerable intake levels, these shortcomings hamper risk management and communication. OBJECTIVE: The integrated probabilistic risk assessment (IPRA) combines dose-response and exposure data to estimate the likelihood of adverse effects. We evaluated the usefulness of the IPRA for risk characterization related to decreased levels of total triiodothyronine (T3) in humans following a real case of high exposure to PFAS via drinking water. METHODS: PFAS exposure was defined as serum levels from residents of a contaminated area in Ronneby, Sweden. Median levels were 270 ng=mL [perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)] and 229 ng=mL [perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)] for individuals who resided in Ronneby 1 y before the exposure termination. This data was integrated with data from a subchronic toxicity study in monkeys exposed daily to PFOS. Benchmark dose modeling was employed to describe separate dose–effect relationship for males and females, and extrapolation factor distributions were used to estimate the corresponding human benchmark dose. The critical effect level was defined as a 10% decrease in total T3. RESULTS: The median probability of critical exposure, following a combined exposure to PFOS and PFHxS, was estimated to be [2.1% (90% CI: 0:4%–13:1%)]. Gender-based analysis showed that this risk was almost entirely distributed among women, namely [3.9% (90% CI: 0:8%–21:6%)]. DISCUSSION: The IPRA was compared with the traditional deterministic Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach. We conclude that probabilistic risk characterization represents an important step forward in the ability to adequately analyze group-specific health risks. Moreover, quantifying the sour-ces of uncertainty is desirable, as it improves the awareness among stakeholders and will guide future efforts to improve accuracy. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6654. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Recent findings: Pancreatic islet cells are highly sensitive to hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia contributes to poor islet yield at isolation, as well as inflammatory events and cellular death during culture and early posttransplantation. Use of oxygen carriers, such as semifluorinated alkanes, during pancreas preservation and gas-permeable devices for islet culture and transport has in Recent findings:studies proven beneficial. Beta-cell death can be limited posttransplantation by targeting hypoxia-induced cellular pathways that cause apoptotic death. Owing to low revascularization, impaired oxygenation seems to prevail in intraportally transplanted islets. Means to improve revascularization, oxygenation and function of transplanted islets can be achieved not only by stimulating angiogenic factors, but also by decrease of angiostatic factors such as thrombospondin-1 in islets for transplantation. Moreover, bone-marrow-derived cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, can induce or contribute to increased revascularization. Summary: Low oxygenation of islets contributes to cellular death and dysfunction during preparation of islets for transplantation, as well as posttransplantation. Interventions at these different steps to ensure adequate oxygenation have the potential to improve the results of clinical islet transplantation. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",acetylcysteine; alkane; alpha 1 antitrypsin; angiogenic factor; antioxidant; endostatin; fibroblast growth factor; gelatinase B; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; oxygen; perfluorodecalin; perfluorohexyloctane; reactive oxygen metabolite; scatter factor; thrombospondin; thrombospondin 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; vasculotropin A; aerobic metabolism; bone marrow cell; cell death; cell function; cell survival; hematopoietic stem cell; hypoxia; in vitro study; kidney capsule; mesenchymal stem cell; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; oxygen tension; oxygenation; pancreas islet; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell; pancreas islet transplantation; revascularization; review; swine; Animals; Cell Death; Cell Hypoxia; Humans; Islets of Langerhans; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Tissue Culture Techniques

The use of the molecular marker approach for tracing urban sewage inputs and oil contamination in the marine environment is illustrated and specific indices to improve the source specificity discussed. Furthermore, the major atmospheric and oceanic transport pathways and biotic and abiotic transformation processes of marine contaminants are summarized. Several indices based on the ratios of parent compounds and metabolites are defined to assess the biodegradation of contaminants (LABs, DDTs, TBT) and the age of their inputs in the marine environment.

Thus, there are concerns about their potential effects on soil ecosystems and some studies have monitored EDCs in the soil environment. However, there have been few studies on soil ecotoxicity of EDCs so far compared with aquatic ecotoxicity, and there is no comprehensive review of soil ecotoxicity of EDCs. Therefore, we collected, compiled and reviewed 77 studies on the soil ecotoxicity of seven prominent EDCs: bisphenol A, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenols, triclosan, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS). This review brings together the data on soil ecotoxicity and research trends for these seven EDCs and identifies the need for further research to fill the gaps in our knowledge and data.

Many industry compounds, due to their important commercial value and numerous ap-plications, are produced on a global scale, while the mechanism of their endocrine action has not been fully understood. In recent years, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have gained the interest of major international health organizations, and thus more and more studies have been aimed to explain the toxicity of these compounds. PFASs were firstly synthesized in the 1950s and broadly used in the industry in the production of firefighting agents, cosmetics and herbicides. The numerous industrial applications of PFASs, combined with the exceptionally long half-life of these substances in the human body and extreme environmental persistence, result in a common and chronic exposure of the general population to their action. Available data have suggested that human exposure to PFASs can occur during different stages of development and may cause short-or/and long-term health effects. This paper synthetizes the current literature reports on the presence, bioaccumulation and, particularly, endocrine toxicity of selected long-and short-chain PFASs, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms underlying their endocrine actions. © 2021 by the author.

Despite the absence of significant similarity of their amino acid sequences, both proteins share the same core architecture and a common nucleotide binding site resembling the structure of hexokinase. All three are ATPases or kinases and bind ATP in association with Mg2+ or Ca2+. The common fold consists of two α/β domains, which are connected by a putative hinge with an ATP-binding site situated between the domains. Each domain contains a five-stranded β-sheet of identical topology, which suggests that the molecules may have evolved by gene duplication. From a comparison of the three aligned structures, a fingerprint sequence of the adenine nucleotide binding pocket was derived, which predicted that members of the glycerol kinase family should also have a similar fold of their nucleotide binding domain. This was later confirmed when the X-ray structure was published. Data base search with a refined consensus sequence has retrieved other sugar kinases, as well as the prokaryotic cell cycle proteins FtsA, MreB, and StbA, and two Escherichia coli phosphatases.

In this case, the spectroscopic features of the fluorine atom and the preservation of the parent lipid properties are of primary importance. On the other hand, highly fluorinated phospholipids, which contain a perfluorinated segment in alkyl chains, are mainly developed as drug-delivery devices and oxygen carriers. Here, the particular chemical characteristics of fluorine are used to form more stable and less toxic lipid vesicles/emulsions. This review will focus on describing the synthetic pathways for mono-, poly- and highly fluorinated phosphatidylcholines. We will also discuss, though not thoroughly, their properties and potential applications. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Atoms; Drug delivery; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phospholipids; Biological applications; Biophysical studies; Chemical characteristic; Drug delivery devices; Fluorinated phospholipids; Perfluorinated segments; Phosphatidyl choline; Spectroscopic features; Fluorine

These compounds have been the subject of considerable regulatory scrutiny regarding their potential to pose environmental risks. Recent regulatory focus on these compounds has included an assessment of their potential to meet criteria for persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic compounds (PBTs). To facilitate the evaluation of the environmental behavior of APE and an assessment of their PBT characteristics, a review of the physical-chemical properties and environmental degradation pathways was performed. The most widely used commercial APE are highly water soluble and non-volatile. Nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) are relatively low solubility compounds that are more hydrophilic and volatile than the ethoxylates. Properties of ethoxylate degradation intermediates such as APE1,2 are between values for the commercial APE and the AP building blocks in terms of solubility and partitioning characteristics and are non-volatile at ambient temperatures. The ether carboxylate intermediates are ionic in neutral water solution; hence, they are non-volatile and less prone to partitioning to organic matter. Under aerobic conditions, commercial APE undergo rapid degradation to short chain ethoxylates and ether carboxylates, which in turn degrade ultimately to carbon dioxide and water. Under anaerobic conditions, APE degrade more slowly, and may result in some accumulation of AP. Degradation half-lives and the potential for these compounds to bioaccumulate will be examined in a companion article. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA

Among the most important reasons for the transmission of infection between humans is the presence of this virus active on the surfaces and materials. Here, we addressed important questions such as do coronaviruses remain active on the inanimate surfaces? Do the types of inanimate surfaces affect the activity of coronaviruses? What are the most suitable ingredients that used to inactivate viruses? This review article addressed many of the works that were done in the previous periods on the survival of many viruses from the coronaviruses family on various surfaces such as steel, glass, plastic, Teflon, ceramic tiles, silicon rubber and stainless steel copper alloys, Al surface, sterile sponges, surgical gloves and sterile latex. The impacts of environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were presented and discussed. The most important active ingredients that can deactivate viruses on the surfaces were reported here. We hope that these active ingredients will have the same effect on COVID-19. © 2020 De Gruyter.

The complement system has an established role in the pathogenesis of MS, and evidence suggests that its components can be used as biomarkers of disease-state activity and response to treatment in MS. Plasma C4a levels have been found to be significantly elevated in patients with active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), as compared to both controls and patients with stable RRMS. C3 levels are also significantly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with RRMS, and C3 levels are correlated with clinical disability. Furthermore, increased levels of factor H can predict the transition from relapsing to progressive disease, since factor H levels have been found to increase progressively with disease progression over a 2-year period in patients transitioning from RRMS to secondary progressive (SP) MS. In addition, elevations in C3 are seen in primary progressive (PP) MS. Complement components can also differentiate RRMS from neuromyelitis optica. Response gene to complement (RGC)-32, a novel molecule induced by complement activation, is a possible biomarker of relapse and response to glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy, since RGC-32 mRNA expression is significantly decreased during relapse and increased in responders to GA treatment. The predictive accuracy of RGC-32 as a potential biomarker (by ROC analysis) is 90% for detecting relapses and 85% for detecting a response to GA treatment. Thus, complement components can serve as biomarkers of disease activity to differentiate MS subtypes and to measure response to therapy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","aquaporin 4; biological marker; clusterin; complement; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C3b; complement component C4a; complement component C4d; complement component C5b; complement component C8; complement factor H; cyclin dependent kinase 1; Fas ligand; glatiramer; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 21; lectin; mannan binding lectin; mannan binding lectin associated serine proteinase; protein 14 3 3; protein BAD; protein Bid; transcription factor RUNX1; transforming growth factor beta; cell cycle protein; complement; muscle protein; nerve protein; pharmacological biomarker; RGC32 protein, human; apoptosis; blood brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; complement activation; complement alternative pathway; demyelination; disease activity; early response gene; Expanded Disability Status Scale; gray matter; human; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein function; relapse; Review; signal transduction; treatment response; animal; blood; differential diagnosis; disease exacerbation; genetics; metabolism; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; Animals; Biomarkers, Pharmacological; Cell Cycle Proteins; Complement System Proteins; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Glatiramer Acetate; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Muscle Proteins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neuromyelitis Optica"

Several methods have been developed to measure P(i), all measuring the fluid equilibration pressure, i.e., the pressure in a saline-filled tube brought into contact with the interstitium. The methods designed to establish such contact may be characterized as acute and chronic. With acute methods, i.e., needle without infusion, wick catheters, WIN, and micropipettes, measurements are made within minutes to a few hours after insertion of the device. The chronic methods are various capsules (perforated, porous, or Teflon® rings) implanted into the tissue 4 to 6 weeks before measurements. A general finding in previous studies from different laboratories and in different species have been that the chronic methods give more strongly negative (subatmospheric) P(i) than the acute methods, and that the chronic methods give much greater pressure responses to changes in IFV. By direct comparison of acute and chronic methods in the same tissue and site, all give similar P(i) in steady state conditions, while an acute over- and dehydration results in far more pronounced pressure changes recorded with chronic than with acute devices. It is proposed that these transient pressure differences recorded by acute vs. chronic methods result from different physical properties of the capsule lining compared with that of the surrounding skin, in addition to a possible osmometer effect of the capsule lining. Recent data show that such methodological problems have resulted in great variation in the estimation of compliance of the interstitium and have overemphasized the importance of P(i) as an edema-preventing mechanism. In conclusion, no ideal all-purpose method is available for the measurement of P(i). A given technique should be tested against other methods in the same tissue, site, and species in which it is intended to be used. If possible, comparison should be made with micropipette measurements.In this review, the author gives a detailed description of the methods for Pi measurement and their performance in steady state and during changes in tissue hydration. Since most studies have been on skin/subcutaneous tissue and to a somewhat less extent also on skeletal muscle, the author focuses on these tissues and only briefly considers other tissues. A discussion is also presented interstitial compliance, i.e., the relationship between change in IFV and Pi during alterations in tissue hydration, and how this parameter is affected by the method for Pi measurement. Finally, the author considers the importance of Pi and other factors in edema prevention.","Biomedical Engineering--Surgical Implants; Edema; Implanted Porous Capsules; Interstitial Compliance; Interstitial Fluid Pressure; Interstitial Fluid Volume; Wick Catheter Technique; Biological Materials; methodology; physiology; review; tissue pressure; Animal; Compliance; Equipment Design; Extracellular Space; Human; Hydrostatic Pressure; Manometry; Osmotic Pressure; Prostheses and Implants; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Infectious flacherie virus"

Fluctuating energy supplies demand a load-flexible energy system and a dynamically operating FTS reactor might be beneficial compared to traditional steady-state operations which rely on expensive upstream buffer capacities. This review provides an overview of recent experimental and simulation studies dealing with dynamic FTS operation and summarizes the main findings. The results are presented the two categories, process intensification and PtX application. The review further discusses the experimentally difficult task of wide-ranging product characterization with a high temporal resolution. While dynamic reactor operation is often related to a complicated process control, which challenges a save and efficient reactor performance, the literature findings indicate that for dynamic FTS operation such concerns might not be as critical as assumed, at least within well-known boundaries. Researchers further agree that dynamic operation might be a tool for process intensification. Especially hydrogen pulsing seems to be a potentially beneficial operating technique to remove accumulated liquid products, restore initial catalyst activity and increase diesel-range productivity. The main challenge in this context is the prevention of high methane selectivity. A lucid future engineering goal seems to be the combination of the two applications: a robust and reliable FTS reactor in a PtX scenario that not only handles a fluctuating feed but uses such variations for process enhancement. © 2022 The Authors",Catalyst activity; Fuel storage; Dynamic operations; Excess energy; Fischer-Tropsch reactors; Fluctuation; Fossil resources; Power; Power-to-X; Process intensification; Product analysis; Synthesis reactors; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

Fluoropolymers possess a unique combination of properties and unmatched functional performance critical to the products and manufacturing processes they enable and are irreplaceable in many uses. Fluoropolymers have documented safety profiles; are thermally, biologically, and chemically stable, negligibly soluble in water, nonmobile, nonbioavailable, nonbioaccumulative, and nontoxic. Although fluoropolymers fit the PFAS structural definition, they have very different physical, chemical, environmental, and toxicological properties when compared with other PFAS. This study describes the composition, uses, performance properties, and functionalities of 14 fluoropolymers, including fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers, and presents data to demonstrate that they satisfy the widely accepted polymer hazard assessment criteria to be considered polymers of low concern (PLC). The PLC criteria include physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, which determine bioavailability and warn of potential hazard. Fluoropolymers are insoluble (e.g., water, octanol) solids too large to migrate into the cell membrane making them nonbioavailable, and therefore, of low concern from a human and environmental health standpoint. Further, the study results demonstrate that fluoropolymers are a distinct and different group of PFAS and should not be grouped with other PFAS for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. When combined with an earlier publication by Henry et al., this study demonstrates that commercial fluoropolymers are available from the seven participating companies that meet the criteria to be considered PLC, which represent approximately 96% of the global commercial fluoropolymer market.

It is based upon the relative position of cerebellum and brainstem in relation to the foramen magnum and the upper cervical canal. Types I to III are degrees of a similar abnormality in which a conical deformity of the posterior midline cerebellum and the elongated brainstem lie at or below the foramen magnum. In the Type IV deformity, in contrast, the cerebellum and brainstem lie fully within the posterior fossa and their position in relation to the foramen magnum is normal. The most common example of this type is probably the Dandy‐Walker malformation, in which a defect in the inferior vermis is congruent with a ventriculocele of the enlarged fourth ventricle. The Chiari malformations are generally associated with hydrocephalus. The most comprehensive and coherent theory of the origin of these malformations is that abnormal hydrostatic forces, acting principally during the second and early third trimesters of gestation, provide the mechanism of posterior fossa deformity. Morphological evidence indicates that posterior fossa structures in Types I to III are ‘pushed down’ from above. Radio‐isotope dilution studies suggest that the mechanism of hydrocephalus in Types 1 to III is overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); initially there may be no obstructive component. In those cases without spina bifida, ventricular enlargement should occur early and be greatest in the forebrain, driving the tentorium and posterior fossa structures downward. Where there is a fistulous communication between the ventricular system and the amniotic cavity via a spina‐bifida defect, a pressure gradient between intracranial and spinal compartments may be sufficient to account for downward displacement of posterior fossa structures. In this instance ventricular enlargement may occur only after cerebellar impaction causes frank obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. In the Dandy‐Walker malformation, the mechanism of hydrocephalus is probably obstruction to flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the roof of the fourth ventricle. Enlargement of the fourth ventricle is sufficient not only to compress the cerebellum and give rise to the inferior vermal defect, but also to offset forces above the tentorium and prevent its caudal displacement from the parietal region. Les malformations de Chiari de la fosse postérieure et lew rapport avec l'hydrocéphalic La classification des malformations de développement de la fosse postérieure associée à une hydrocéphalic, telle que l'a proposée Chiari est systématique et de portée étendue. Cette classification est basée sur la position relative du cervelet et du tronc cérébral en relation avec le trou occipital et le canal cervical supérieur. Les types I à III sont des degrés d'une anomalie unique dans laquelle une déformation conique de la ligne moyenne cérébelleuse postérieure et le tronc cérébral allongé se situe au niveau et au‐dessous du trou occipital. Dans la déformation de type IV au contraire, le cervelet et le tronc cérébral se situent entièrement dans la fosse postérieure et leur position par rapport au trou occipital est normale. L'exemple le plus commun de ce type est probablement la malformation de Dandy‐Walker, dans laquelle un défaut du vermis inférieur se superpose à un ventriculocèle d'un quatrième ventricule élargi. Les malformations de Chiari sont, en général, associées à une hydrocéphalic La théorie la plus cohérente et la plus complète sur l'origine de ces malformations suppose que des forces hydrostatiques anormales agissant principalement durant le second et le début du troisième trimestre de la gestation constitue le mécanisme des déformations de la fosse postérieure. Des données morphologiques indiquent dans les types I à III que les structures de la fosse postérieure subissent une ‘poussée’ de haut en bas. Les études par dilution de radioisotope suggerènt que le mécanisme de l'hydrocéphalie dans les types I à III est une surproduction de liquide céphalorachidien (LCR); il peut n'y avoir initialement aucune composante d'obstruction. Dans les cas sans spina bifida, l'élargissement ventriculaire se produirait précocément, serait maximum dans le cerveau antérieur, poussant vers le bas la tente du cervelet et les structures de la fosse postérieure. En cas de communication fistuleuse entre le système ventriculaire et la cavité amniotique par spina bifida, la différence de pression entre les compartiments intra‐crâniens et spinaux peut être suffisante pour provoquer le déplacement vers le bas des structures de la fosse postérieure. Dans ce cas, l'élargissement ventriculaire peut ne se produire qu'après que l'impact cérébelleux ait provoqué une obstruction franche à la circulation du LCR. Dans la malformation de Dandy‐Walker, l'hydrocéphalie est probablement causée par l'obstruction de la circulation du LCR à travers le toit du quatrième ventricule. L'élargissement du quatrième ventricule est suffisant non seulement pour comprimer le cervelet et provoquer le défaut du vermis inférieur, mais aussi pour contrecarrer les forces venant d'au‐dessus de la tente et empêchant un déplacement caudal à partir des régions pariétales. Die Chiari‐Miβbildungen der hinteren Schädelgrube und ihre Beziehung zum Hydrocephalus Die Einteilung der Entwicklungsmißbildungen der hinteren Schädelgrubs in Verbindung mit einem Hydrocephalus, wie sie von Chiari vorgeschlagen ist, ist systematisch und umfassend. Die Einteilung basiert auf der Lagebeziehung des Kleinhirns und des Hirnstamms zum Foramen magnum und zum oteren Cervicalkanal. Die Typen I bis III sind verschiedene Grade der gleichen Abnormität, bei der eine konische Deformierung der posterioren Mittellinie des Kleinhirns und des verlängerten Hirnstamms im oder unterhalb des Foramen magnum liegt. Im Gegensatz dazu liegen bei der Deformität des Typs IV das Kleinhirn und der Hirnstamm vollständig innerhalb der hinteren Schädelgrube, und ihre Lagebeziehung zum Foramen magnum ist normal. Das häufigste Beispiel dieses Typs ist wahrscheinlich die Dandy‐Walker‐Mißbildung, bei der ein Defekt des unteren Klein‐hirnwurmes zusammenfällt mit einer Ventriculocele eines vergrößerten vierten Ventrikels. Die Chiari‐Mißbildungen sind im allgemeinen verbunden mit einem Hydrocephalus. Die umfassendste und zutreffendste Theorie über den Ursprung dieser Mißbildungen sagt, daß abnorme hydrostatische Kräfte, die hauptsächlich während des zweiten und frühen dritten Trimesters der Gestationszeit wirken, den Mechanismus der Mißbildung der hinteren Schädelgrube verursachen. Morphologische Hinweise sprechen dafür, daß die Strukturen der hinteren Schädelgrube bei den Typen I bis III von oben her ‘hinuntergedrückt’ werden. Radioisotopenverteilungsstudien lassen vermuten, daß der Mechanismus des Hydrocephalus der Typen I bis III eine Überproduktion von Liquor (CFS) ist; anfänglich mag eine obstruktive Komponente fehlen. In solchen Fällen ohne Spina bifida, sollte die Erweiterung der Ventrikel früh auftreten und am größten im Vorderhirn sein, das Tentorium und die Strukturen der hinteren Schädelgrube hinunterdiängend. Wo eine Fistelverbindung zwischen dem Ventrikelsystem und der Amnionhöhle über einen Spina‐bifida‐Defekt besteht, könnte ein Druckgradient zwischen den intrakraniellen und spinalen Anteilen ausreichen, die Verlagerung der Strukturen der hinteren Schädelgruba zu verursachen. In diesem Fall könnte die Ventrikelerweiterung erst auftreten, nachdem eine cerebelläre Einklemmung eine Verlegung des Liquorflusses bedingt. Bei der Dandy‐Walker‐Mißbildung ist der Mechanismus des Hydrocephalus wahrscheinlich eine Verlegung des Liquorabflusses durch das Dach des vierten Ventrikels. Die Erweiterung des vierten Ventrikels reicht aus, nicht nur das Kleinhirn zu komprimieren und den Defekt des unteren Kleinhirnwurmes entstehen zu lassen, sondern auch Kräfte über das Tentorium freizusetzen und seine kaudale Verdrängung von der Parietalregion zu verhindern. Las malformaciones de Chiari de la fosa posterior y su relation con la hidrocefalia La clasificación de las malformaciones del desarrollo de la fosa posterior asociadas a la hidrocefalia propuestas por Chiari son completas y sistemáticas. La clasificación se basa en la posición relativa del cerebelo y del tronco cerebral en relación con el foramen magnum y la parte alta del canal cervical. Los tipos I al III son grados de una anomalía similar en la que una deformación crónica del cerebelo medio posterior y el tronco cerebral elongado yacen a nivel o por debajo del foramen magnum. En la malformación IV, por el contrario, el cerebelo y el tronco cerebral yacen por completo en la fase posterior y su posición en relación con el foramen magnum es normal. El ejemplo más común de este tipo es probablemente la malformación de Dandy‐Walker, en que un defecto del vermis inferior es congruente con un ventrículocele del cuarto ventrículo agrandado. Las malformaciones de Chiari en general son halladas en asociacion con hidrocefalia. La teoría más comprensiva y coherente sobre el origen de estas malformaciones mantiene que las fuerzas hidrostáticas anormales, actuando principalmente durante el segundo y tercer trimestre de la gestatión, proporcionan el mecanismo de la deformación de la fase posterior. La evidencia neurológica indica que las estructuras de la fase posterior en los tipos I al III son “empujadas hacia abajo” desde arriba. Los estudios con radioisótopes diluidos sugieren que el mecanismo de la hidrocefalia en los tipos I al III es una sobreproducción de líquido cefalorraquídeo (LCR); inicialmente puede no haber ningún componente obstructive En los casos sin espina bífida, el agrandamiento ventricular podría ocurrir tempranamente y ser mayor en el cerebro anterior, llevando el tentorio y las estructuras de la fase posterior hacia abajo. Cuando existe una comunicación fistulosa entre el sistema ventricular y la cav dad amniótica a través de un defecto de espina bífida, un gradeiente de presión entre los compartimentos intracraneal y espinal puede ser suficiente para explicar el desplazamiento hacia abajo de las estructuras de la fase posterior. En este caso, el agrandamiento ventricular puede ocurrir solamente después de que el impacto cerebeloso cause una franca obstructión del flujo del LCR. En la malformación de Dandy‐Walker el mecanismo del hidrocefalo probablemente es una obstructión del flujo del LCR a través del techo del cuarto ventrículo. El agrandamiento del cuarto ventrículo es suficiente no sólo para comprimir el cerebelo y producir el defecto del vermis inferior sino también para compensar las fuerzas por encima del tentorio y evitar su desplazamiento caudal a partir de la región parietal.

Numerous nine and long-enough (e.g. perfluorooctyl, C8F17) fluorous ponytails can be employed for fluorous phase immobilization of lanthanide catalysts and to catalyze the Diels-Alder and Friedel-Crafts reactions more efficiently. Meanwhile, Bis(perfluoroalkylsulfonyl)amides of lanthanum, ytterbium, yttrium, and scandium have been described as strong Lewis acids, more powerful catalysts for Diels-Alder acylation, esterification, and Baeyer-Villiger reactions. The key to success is that lanthanide complexes are extremely efficient Lewis acid catalysts by virtue of the highly electron-withdrawing and solubilizing effect of tris(perfluoroalkylsulfonyl)methide and bis(perfluoroalkylsulfonyl)amide without hydrocarbon spacers. On the other hand, it has been reported that a new rare earth perfluorocarboxylate catalyst, the rare earth perfluorooctanoate, showed efficient catalytic activity in the Mannich reaction and the reaction of indole with carbonyl compounds due to the unique surfactivity of the long perfluoro-chain. These catalysts can be prepared, stored and recoveredeasily. In this paper, we will review the application of long perfluoro-chain lanthanide catalysts in a series of organic reactions. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",amide; aromatic compound; bis(perfluoroalkylsulfonyl)amide; carbonyl derivative; hydrocarbon; indole; lanthanide; lanthanum; Lewis acid; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanoic acid; scandium; tris(perfluoroalkylsulfonyl)methide; unclassified drug; ytterbium; yttrium; acylation; Baeyer Villiger reaction; catalysis; chemical structure; Diels Alder reaction; esterification; Friedel Crafts reaction; Mannich reaction; nitration; organic chemistry; recycling; review; structure analysis

Our understanding of extracellular proteostasis is rather limited and largely restricted to knowledge of 11 currently established extracellular chaperones (ECs). This review will briefly outline what is known of the established ECs, before moving on to discuss experimental strategies used to identify new members of this growing family, and an examination of a group of putative new ECs identified using one of these approaches. An observation that emerges from an analysis of the expanding number of ECs is that all of these proteins are multifunctional. Strikingly, the armory of activities each possess uniquely suit them as a group to act together at sites of tissue damage, infection, and inflammation to restore homeostasis.

Initial biological studies found that vinigrol possesses both antihypertensive and platelet aggregation-inhibitory properties. More recent studies have identified vinigrol as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist. In addition, vinigrol has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and inflammation. Structurally, the 1,5-butanodecahydronaphthalene core with eight contiguous stereocenters located in vinigrol represents the unprecedented and unique motif found in natural product small molecules. This promising biological activities of vinigrol combined with its unique terpene framework have attracted significant attention from the synthetic community. However, the total synthesis of vinigrol has been regarded as one of the most challenging tasks in the synthesis community for more than two decades. Numerous research efforts have been oriented toward the total synthesis of vinigrol, including Paquette, Corey, Hanna and other groups before 2008. Until now, four elegant total syntheses have been reported. In 2009, Baran and co-workers completed the first total synthesis of (±)-vinigrol, and the challenging 1,5-butanodecahydronaphthalene core was constructed by a way of intermolecular Diels-Alder and intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions followed by Grob fragmentation. Key salient features including an unusual dipolar cycloaddition for establishing the cis-orientation of the C8-methyl and C8a-hydroxy groups, and a later stage of Shapiro reaction via the tri-anionic species to deliver the final target. The synthesis was completed in a 23-step route with 3% overall yield from commercially available materials. This work represented a landmark achievement in the vinigrol synthesis. In 2013, Njardarson and co-workers completed another remarkable total synthesis of (±)-vinigrol, and the challenging 1,5-butanodecahydronaphthalene core was established with an elegant oxidative dearomatization/intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction followed by a Wharton fragmentation. In 2019, Luo and co-workers reported the first asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-vinigrol, with an impressive transannular Diels-Alder reaction as the key step. This scalable synthesis of (-)-vinigrol was completed in a 20-step route with 1.4% overall yield from commercially available materials, and provided over 600 mg of natural product in one operation. It should be noted that the Diels-Alder reaction was a crucial element in the synthetic strategy toward vinigrol in all these noteworthy achievements. Later, our group reported another asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-vinigrol using a unique Type II [5+2] cycloaddition and a novel ring contraction cascade as the key reactions. This synthetic work represents the first example of an intramolecular [5+2] cycloaddition to construct eight-membered ring system in natural product synthesis. Furthermore, the linear sequence of our concise asymmetric total synthesis of (-)-vinigrol was only 14 steps from commercially available material and without the need for protecting groups during the whole synthesis. The goal of this review is to provide a survey of advances in the total synthesis of vinigrol and discuss the synthetic strategies and tactics in each synthesis. The authors also hope that this review will serve a useful guidance for organic chemists who involved in total synthesis of natural products and provide a stimulus for inventions and further advances in this exciting area. © 2021, Science Press.

Fructans are fructose-based polymers synthesized from sucrose by fructosyltransferases (FTs). They have been increasingly recognized as protective agents against abiotic stresses. Using model membranes, numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that fructans can stabilize membranes by direct H-bonding to the phosphate and choline groups of membrane lipids, resulting in a reduced water outflow from the dry membranes. Inulin-type fructans are flexible random-coiled structures that can adopt many conformations, allowing them to insert deeply within the membranes. The devitrification temperature (T g) can be adjusted by their varying molecular weights. In addition, above Tg their low crystallization rates ensure prolonged membrane protection. Supporting, in vivo studies with transgenic plants expressing FTs showed fructan accumulation and an associated improvement in freezing and/or chilling tolerance. The water-soluble nature of fructans may allow their rapid adaptation as cryoprotectants in order to give optimal membrane protection. One of the emerging concepts for delivering vacuolar fructans to the extracellular space for protecting the plasma membrane is vesicle-mediated, tonoplast-derived exocytosis. It should, however, be noted that natural stress tolerance is a very complex process that cannot be explained by the action of a single molecule or mechanism. © The Author [2008].

These chemicals are probably able to contribute not only to the development of obesity and metabolic disturbances in individuals, but also in their progeny, having the capability to epigenetically reprogram genetically inherited set-up points for body weight and body composition control during critical periods of development, such as fetal, early life, and puberty. In individuals, they may act on myriads of neuro-endocrine–immune metabolic regulatory pathways, leading to pathophysiological consequences in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, immunity, the influencing of central appetite and energy expenditure regulations, changes in gut microbiota–intestine functioning, and many other processes. Evidence-based medical data have recently brought much more convincing data about associations of particular chemicals and the probability of the raised risk of developing obesity. Foods are the main source of obesogens. Some obesogens occur naturally in food, but most are environmental chemicals, entering food as a foreign substance, whether in the form of contaminants or additives, and they are used in a large amount in highly processed food.

Experimental studies along with quantitative structure activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) models are used to determine the physiochemical properties of these contaminants. The estimated properties have been extensively used to predict environmental fate and transportation of chemicals. However, application of these QSAR/QSPR models in remediation technology design is not widely explored. In this review paper, we have shown that remediation parameters (e.g., dehalogenation rate constant) estimated by QSAR/QSPR models can inform the remediation technology design. For this purpose, we examined the state of knowledge on the development of QSAR/QSPR models for physiochemical properties estimation of two selected model compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Molecular descriptors such as energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), chlorine and fluorine number, molar volume (VM) and total surface area (TSA) are inputs of the QSAR/QSPR models that can be used for estimation of the remediation parameters. This approach is suitable to be applied at the initial stage of remediation process development, to further inform bench-scale, pilot-scale, and full-scale stages. The suggested approach can expedite remediation technology design for emerging contaminants or newly developed chemicals for which the knowledge about their fate and behaviour in the environment is limited. © 2021 The Author(s)",NA

Rodent studies show reverse effects, i.e. decreased blood cholesterol and triglycerides, occurring however at PFAS serum levels at least 100-fold higher than those in humans. This paper aims to present the main issues regarding the modulation of lipid homeostasis by the two most common PFASs, PFOS and PFOA, with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms relevant for humans. Overall, the apparent contrast between human and animal data may be an artifact of dose, with different molecular pathways coming into play upon exposure to PFASs at very low versus high levels. Altogether, the interpretation of existing rodent data on PFOS/PFOA-induced lipid perturbations with respect to the human situation is complex. From a mechanistic perspective, research on human liver cells shows that PFOS/PFOA activate the PPARα pathway, whereas studies on the involvement of other nuclear receptors, like PXR, are less conclusive. Other data indicate that suppression of the nuclear receptor HNF4α signaling pathway, as well as perturbations of bile acid metabolism and transport might be important cellular events that require further investigation. Future studies with human-relevant test systems would help to obtain more insight into the mechanistic pathways pertinent for humans. These studies shall be designed with a careful consideration of appropriate dosing and toxicokinetics, so as to enable biologically plausible quantitative extrapolations.

Multiple scientific studies of polar bears indicate negative relationships between exposure to these contaminants and health parameters; however, these are all of a correlative nature and do not represent true cause-and-effects. Therefore, information from controlled studies of farmed Norwegian Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and housed East and West Greenland sledge dogs (Canis familiaris) were included as supportive weight of evidence in the clarification of contaminant exposure and health effects in polar bears. The review showed that hormone and vitamin concentrations, liver, kidney and thyroid gland morphology as well as reproductive and immune systems of polar bears are likely to be influenced by contaminant exposure. Furthermore, exclusively based on polar bear contaminant studies, bone density reduction and neurochemical disruption and DNA hypomethylation of the brain stem seemed to occur. The range of tissue concentration, at which these alterations were observed in polar bears, were ca. 1-70,000. ng/g lw for OCs (blood plasma concentrations of some PCB metabolites even higher), ca. 1-1000. ng/g lw for PBDEs and for PFCs and Hg 114-3052. ng/g ww and 0.1-50 Μg/g ww, respectively. Similar concentrations were found in farmed foxes and housed sledge dogs while the lack of dose response designs did not allow an estimation of threshold levels for oral exposure and accumulated tissue concentrations. Nor was it possible to pinpoint a specific group of contaminants being more important than others nor analyze their interactions. For East Greenland polar bears the corresponding daily ΞOC and oral exposure was estimated to be 35 and 0.34 Μg/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, PFC concentrations, at which population effect levels could occur, are likely to be reached around year 2012 for the East Greenland polar bear subpopulation if current increasing temporal trends continue. Such proposed reproductive population effects were supported by physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of critical body residues (CBR) with risk quotients > 1 for ΞPCB, dieldrin, ΞPFC and ΞOHC (organohalogen contaminant). The estimated daily TEQ for East Greenland polar bears and East Greenland sledge dogs were 32-281-folds above WHO ΞTEQ guidelines for humans. Compared to human tolerable daily intake (TDI), these were exceeded for PCBs, dieldrin, chlordanes and ΞHCH in East Greenland polar bears. Comparisons like these should be done with caution, but together with the CBR modelling and T-score estimations, these were the only available tools for polar bear risk evaluation. In conclusion, polar bears seem to be susceptible to contaminant induced stress that may have an overall sub-clinical impact on their health and population status via impacts on their immune and reproductive systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Bone; Brain; Climate change; Contamination; Endocrinology; Health; Hormones; Immune system; Impurities; Insecticides; Liver; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Reviews; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Steroid hormones; Tissue; Vitamins; Arctic; Arctic foxes; Bone mineral density; Critical body residue; CYP-450; Endocrine disruption; Endocrine organs; Kidney; OCPs; OHCs; Organochlorine pesticides; Organochlorines; Organohalogen contaminants; Osteoporosis; PBDEs; PFCs; Polar bears; Reproductive organs; Sexual organs; Skeletal system; Sledge dog; T-score; Thyroid hormones; Mammals; chlordane; dieldrin; hormone; mercury; organochlorine derivative; organohalogen derivative; perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; vitamin; bear; endocrine disruptor; health impact; health risk; hormone; immune system; long range transport; mercury (element); organochlorine; PBDE; PCB; pesticide; physiological response; pollutant transport; pollution effect; pollution exposure; predator; reproductive health; vitamin; animal health; animal tissue; Arctic; bioaccumulation; body weight; bone density; brain stem; Canis familiaris; concentration response; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease predisposition; DNA methylation; dog; environmental exposure; female; fox; genital system; health hazard; hormone blood level; immune system; kidney; liver; male; maximum permissible dose; neurochemistry; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; polar bear; predator; priority journal; review; stress; thyroid gland; tissue level; vitamin blood level; Vulpes lagopus; Alopex lagopus; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Ursus maritimus; Vulpes lagopus

However, the physiological determinants of biomarker toxicokinetics and measured levels may also affect or be affected by disease determinants and thus introduce confounding. In a study published in this issue of the Journal, Sagiv et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(4):793-802) sought empirical evidence on the role of renal clearance in biasing the association between perfluoroalkyl compounds measured in plasma during pregnancy and infant birth weight. They found little empirical support for such bias. The risk of such bias is greater when the exposure and health outcome are assessed closely in time, when physiological differences are large relative to variability in environmental levels, and when the physiological determinant has diverse functions and implications. While empirical examination has value, the potential bias is difficult to measure and control when the underlying associations among exposure biomarker, health outcome, and physiological determinant are weak. © The Author(s) 2018.

The continuous use in the treatment against several bacterial infections paves a way to increased resistant strains. Environmental pollution created by antibiotics is considered as a serious problem though no toxic reports were known until now. The pharmaceutical compounds present in the environment are known as “Emerging Pollutants.” Among antibiotics, tetracycline (TET) class of drugs were known to exist for several years. Within 3–4 years of the discovery of the first class of TET, the resistant strains were also identified. TET usage is not only limited for human therapy but also greatly used in veterinary and agricultural purposes. These compounds have been detected in the environment, especially in aquatic farms, groundwater, surface water, etc., thus, it becomes vital to take some measures in removing these compounds from the ecosystem to some extent. Many degradation methodologies and mechanisms were applied to remove TET but were highly limited to synthetic effluents. Adsorption is a common practice at the industrial level, especially in effluent treatment processes. In this study, removal of TET through adsorption using various adsorbents was reviewed extensively. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Adsorbents; Antibiotics; Aquatic ecosystems; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Groundwater; Pollution; River pollution; Water treatment; Adsorption studies; Agricultural purpose; Bacterial infections; Emerging pollutants; Environmental pollutions; Pharmaceutical compounds; Synthetic effluent; Tetracycline; Adsorption

C8 contains three nonidentical subunits (α, β, γ) that are products of different genes. These subunits are arranged asymmetrically to form a disulfide-linked C8α-γ dimer that is noncovalently associated with C8β. C8α and C8β are homologous to C6, C7 and C9 and together these proteins comprise what is referred to as the 'MAC protein family'. By comparison, C8γ is distinct in that it belongs to the lipocalin family of small, secreted proteins which have the common ability to bind small hydrophobic ligands. While specific roles have been identified for C8α and C8β in the formation and function of the MAC, a function for C8γ and the identity of its ligand are unknown.

However, the rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs and, therefore, the fraction of HGSOCs that are likely to have originated from the fallopian tube (FT), has remained unclear. Objective: To appraise the literature describing the association between STICs and established HGSOCs. Search strategy: Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Selection criteria: Studies were included if they evaluated the frequency of STICs in HGSOCs, and were published in an English peer-reviewed journal. Data collection and analysis: Appropriate studies were evaluated for their compliance with the ‘Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)’ criteria. Main results: Ten articles met the study selection criteria. The reported coexistence between STICs and HGSOCs ranged from 11% to 61% (mean: 31%, 95% CI: 17–46%). STICs were rarely found in other gynaecological cancers. Small sample size, lack of objective criteria to identify STICs and the retrospective nature of the studies contributed to the variability in reporting the rate of the association. Conclusions: STICs were identified commonly in the FTs of women with HGSOC. Finding the true rate of association between STICs and HGSOCs will require further investigations. While there is evidence that a fraction of HGSOCs arise from the FTs, an accurate estimate of that fraction remains to be determined. The lack of an accurate estimate of the association makes it difficult to evaluate the potential magnitude of reduction of HGSOCs following prophylactic salpingectomy.

NA,The state of POPs in Ghana- A review on persistent organic pollutants: Environmental and human exposure,2019,NA,NA,"Ghana is one of the top pesticide users and highest persistent organic pollutant (POP) emitters in sub-saharan Africa. Despite recent increases in published data, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. As a result, this review aims to address these knowledge gaps by collating available data that reported POPs in Ghanaian environmental matrices, identify spatial and temporal trends, and establish potential health risks. It is worth noting that Ghana has not developed its own regulatory standards for POPs, but adapts United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards. Results obtained showed concentrations in excess of USEPA regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, the data did indicate decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risks assessments were limited although the data indicated risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. This paper provides a critical review of studies of POPs in Ghana which can be used as a reference for all of Africa, as well as other developing countries, for compliance with the requirements for POPs monitoring in the e-waste, food and environmental sectors to inform the mitigation of health risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",NA

The geospatial distribution of DNA ad-ducts, some of which are believed to initiate mutation, may be a clue to understanding the landscape of the preferred occurrence of gastric cancer in the human stomach, such that the occurrence is much more frequent in the lesser curvature than in the greater curvature. Methods: Seven DNA adducts, C5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine, 2′-deoxyinosine, C5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine, N6-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, 1,N6-etheno-2′-deoxyadenosine, N6-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, and C8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine, from different points and zones of the human stomach were semi quanti-tatively measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The differences in the quantity of these DNA adducts from the lesser and greater curvature, the upper, middle and lower third zones, the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach, and the mucosae distant from and near the tumor were compared to determine whether the location preference of cancer in the stomach could be explained by the distribution of these DNA adducts. Comparisons were conducted con-sidering the tumor locations and operation methods. Conclusions: Regarding the DNA adducts in-vestigated, significant differences in quantities and locations in the whole stomach were not noted; thus, these DNA adducts do not explain the preferential occurrence of cancer in particular locations of the human stomach. © 2021 by the authors.

These synthetic chemicals are in widespread use for consumer products, firefighting foams, and industrial applications. They have been detected all over the globe, including at remote locations distant from any possible point sources. One mechanism for long-range transport of PFAS is through sorption to aerosol particles in the atmosphere. PFAS can be transferred from the sea surface to sea spray aerosol particles through wave breaking and bubble bursting, and PFAS emitted to the atmosphere in the gas phase can sorb to particulate matter through gas-particle partitioning. Here we present a comprehensive review of global measurements of PFAS on ambient particulate matter dating back to the first reports from the early 2000s. We summarize findings for the historically important C8 species, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), including detection of isomers and size-segregated measurements, as well as studies of newer and emerging PFAS. We conclude that long-term monitoring of PFAS on particulate matter should be expanded to include more measurement sites in under-sampled regions of the world and that further non-targeted work to identify novel PFAS structures is needed as PFAS manufacturing and regulations continue to evolve. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry",Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Consumer products; Isomers; Organic pollutants; Surface waters; Aerosol particles; Atmospheric aerosol particles; Firefighting foams; Human health; Long range transport; Particulate Matter; Point-sources; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Remote location; Synthetic chemicals; Particles (particulate matter)

An extensive search for toxicological information in rats and mice, and a systematic search for epidemiological evidence were conducted. The linear regression coefficient (LRC) of birth weight (BrthW) on PFOA/PFOS was considered, and separate random effects meta-analyses for untransformed (i.e. not mathematically transformed) and log-transformed values were performed. Toxicological evidence: PFOA: 12 studies (21 datasets) in mice showed statistically significant lower birth/fetal weights from 5 mg/kg body weight per day. PFOS: most of the 13 studies (19 datasets) showed lower birth/fetal weights following in utero exposure. Epidemiological evidence: Sixteen articles were considered. The pooled LRC for a 1 ng/mL increase in untransformed PFOA (12 studies) in maternal plasma/serum was −12.8 g (95% CI −23.2; 2.4), and −27.1 g (95% CI −50.6; −3.6) for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL PFOA (nine studies). The pooled LRC for untransformed PFOS (eight studies) was −0.92 g (95%CI −3.4; 1.6), and for an increase of 1 loge ng/mL was −46.1(95% CI −80.3; −11.9). No consistent pattern emerged for study location or timing of blood sampling. Conclusions: Epidemiological and toxicological evidence suggests that PFOA and PFOS elicit a decrease in BrthW both in humans and rodents.

This paper reviews the recent literature regarding the operation-dependent emission of PN from LD vehicles and HD engines, and the measurement procedure used for regulatory purposes. The repeatability of the PN method is of the order of 5% and higher scatter of the results can easily be explained by the effect of the vehicles or the aftertreatment devices on the PN emissions (e.g., the fill state of the diesel particulate filters). Reproducibility remains an issue since it may exceed 30%. These high-variability levels are mainly associated with calibration uncertainties of the PN instruments. Correlation measurements between the full-flow dilution tunnels (constant-volume samplers, CVS) and the proportional partial-flow dilution systems (PFDS) showed agreement within 15% for the PN method down to 1 × 10 11 p/kWh. At lower concentrations, the PN background of the CVS and/or the PFDS can result in larger inconsistencies. The filter-based particulate matter (PM) mass and the PN emissions correlate well down to 1-2 mg/km for LD vehicles and to 2-3 mg/kWh for HD applications. The correlation improveswhen only elemental carbon mass is considered: it is relatively good down to 0.1-0.3 mg/km or mg/kWh.

The performance, limitations, and possibilities for the practical implementation of different high-temperature proton exchange membranes (PEMs) utilized in fuel cells are discussed in this review paper. A suitable PEM must be developed to improve the performance of membrane electrode assemblies for high-temperature PEMFCs (working temperature above 100 °C). Various PEMs such as sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), sulfonated polystyrene (SPS), sulfonated polyimide (SPI), sulfonated polysulfone (SPSU), phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PA-PBI), perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer-based membranes have been investigated as PEMs for fuel cell applications by several research groups. Among the various PEMs, PA-PBI membranes are the most promising high-temperature PEM for fuel cell applications because of their higher proton conductivity at high temperatures and anhydrous conditions, good chemical and thermal, mechanical stability, and high durability. However, the performance of high-temperature PEMs based on pristine PA-PBI is insufficient to fulfill the need for practical implementation of high-temperature PEMFCs, which needs to be enhanced further before they can be used commercially. Therefore, PA-PBI composite membranes containing various multifunctional inorganic, organic, and hybrid fillers are being actively explored to produce high-temperature PEMs. The PA-PBI composite membranes’ proton conductivity increases with rising temperature and maintains conductivity in anhydrous conditions, as well as chemical, thermal, and oxidative stability under operating conditions and long-term performance stability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical stability; Composite membranes; Energy conversion efficiency; Ethers; High temperature applications; Ketones; Mechanical stability; Proton conductivity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reaction kinetics; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Fuel cell application; High temperature proton exchange membrane; High temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells; Highest temperature; Phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole; Polybenzimidazole; Proton exchange membranes; Fossil fuels; Ethers; Fossil Fuels; Ketones; Membranes; Performance; Polybenzimidazoles; Reaction Kinetics; Temperature

Bagasse, wheat and bamboo are replacing wood as the fiber sources due to their cost effectiveness, wide availability and rapid renewability. Non-wood pulping and thermoforming processes have also advanced greatly which lead to improved fiber recovery, production efficiency and product quality. Challenges include lengthy production cycles, high chemical and energy uses, competition from bioplastics, and presence of toxic per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The industry is evolving rapidly to overcome these challenges including new laminated dry thermoforming processes, natural additives, customized fiber mixes, and PFAS-free products.

Proghrelin is 94 amino acids long in mammals and this undergoes proteolytic processing to produce ghrelin [residues 1-28 of proghrelin(1-94)] and the C-terminal peptide C-ghrelin, which likely contains the entire 66 amino acids of the prohormone C-terminus. The accumulating data identifies ghrelin as having important roles in growth hormone (GH) release, appetite, metabolism, energy balance, cardiovascular function, reproduction, and bone growth. The most striking feature of ghrelin is that it can be acylated at its third amino acid residue (usually Ser), usually in the form of n-octanoyl group (C8:0). Approximately 10-20% of circulating ghrelin is acylated and this feature confers its GH releasing ability, mediated by the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR). In contrast, the remaining 80-90% of circulating ghrelin is desacylated. Desacyl ghrelin was initially thought to be inactive, but recent in vivo and in vitro evidences have identified biological actions for this peptide, independent of GHSR. Whether C-ghrelin has bioactivity remains to be determined, but it is known that plasma concentrations of this peptide respond to endocrine and metabolic manipulations in the same fashion as ghrelin itself. A third putative proghrelin peptide, termed ""obestatin"" has been mooted, but confirmatory biochemical and functional evidences supporting the existence of this peptide have not been forthcoming, suggesting it to be a biochemical miscalculation. This chapter will address biochemical aspects of proghrelin peptides and point to potential avenues for future work. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Recent methods are collected in a detailed table and discussed in the text according to the different classes of compounds. The implementation of on-line SPE made possible the effective development of faster methods by reducing the analysis time and thus increasing the analytical productivity. The on-line SPE method are particularly suitable in studies where only limited sample material is available, as the sample volume can be as low as 1. mL. Most of the multiresidual methods have been developed using wettable and polar embedded reverse phases, sometimes sequentially packed with weak ionic exchangers in order to widen the polarity range of the adsorbents. On-line techniques have been also applied in cleanup of extracts of solid environmental samples, such as sediment, soil and biota, in order to minimize the ionization suppression effects from the matrix.

Endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) pose a documented risk to wildlife and have the potential to negatively influence human health. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of endocrine disruption and the possible involvement of EDCs in metabolic disorders. The first part describes the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear receptors (NRs) in mediating effects of EDCs, in particular, how cross-talk between AhR and NR pathways can lead to endocrine disruption. The second part deals with how these receptors are involved in metabolic functions and how their targeting by EDCs can lead to disturbances in glucose and fat metabolism.

This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement. © 2022 by the authors.

Compartmentalization has resulted in multiple studies that would not otherwise be possible in vivo or in traditional random cultures, such as investigations of axonal transport, biochemical analysis of axons, and axonal injury/regeneration. Chambers for compartmentalizing neurons were first developed for long projection peripheral neurons in the 1970s using machined Teflon dividers and relied on manually applied grease layers to spatially and fluidically separate distal axons from their cell bodies. More recently microfabrication and soft lithography techniques have been used to create compartmentalized micro fluidic platforms, relying on microgrooves contained within a solid barrier through which axons and dendrites are able to extend, but not their cell bodies. These platforms are unique in their ability to culture central nervous system (CNS) neurons and allow high-resolution live imaging. These microfluidic platforms have allowed new investigations of axonal and synaptic biology in the CNS. Moreover, these microfluidic platforms offer improvements for other neural cell and tissue preparations. In this review we discuss traditional methods for compartmentalization, compartmentalized microfluidic platforms, and their use for neurobiology.

It has been evidenced that fuel cells assembled with SSC-PFSA possess higher and more stable performance at elevated temperature up to 130 °C compared to that of fuel cells based on conventional long-side-chain (LSC) PFSA (Nafion®) membranes. Moreover, the shorter side-pendent chains and the absence of the ether group and of the tertiary carbon also endow SSC-PFSAs with better durability, making them more suitable for working at harsh conditions in fuel cell systems. This critical review is dedicated to summarizing the properties of SSC-PFSA and providing insight into an understanding of their micro-morphologies, mass diffusion, enhanced proton transportation and their mutual correlation. Diversified measurement techniques applied to investigate the evolution of micro-morphologies, unique diffusion and transportation properties of SSC-PFSAs are reviewed. Despite the higher crystalline and higher water absorption of SSC-PFSAs than those of LSC-PFSAs, the notably less developed and less interconnected ionic clusters in SSC-PFSAs lead to lower mass permeability, and hence the high water uptake is not as well translated into transportation performance as expected. The factors and reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of SSC-PFSAs such as higher proton conductivity at elevated temperatures and low humidity conditions are also discussed and understood. Highlights of recent advances in SSC-PFSA-based membranes for fuel cell applications at wider temperature ranges are summarized as general references for researchers to further prompt the development of SSC-PFSAs.

The Cochrane Library, Medline, Pre-Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Amed and Cancerlit were searched for relevant studies. Controlled trials comparing non-metal cannulae with metal butterfly needles for giving subcutaneous infusion to palliative care patients were included. The outcome considered was site duration in terms of hours of patency or until change was required. Four trials met the inclusion criteria although overall quality was poor due to low follow-up. Studies examined either Teflon or Vialon-coated catheters. All studies showed non-metal cannulae to be superior to metal. In individual studies estimates in mean increase in duration of the site range from 21 to 159 hours. It seems that non-metal cannulae are more effective in maintaining the duration of subcutaneous infusion sites than butterfly needles. Both types of non-metal catheter showed clear benefits. This review has not examined other outcomes but in general adverse effects lead to the removal of the catheter and so would be reflected in the outcome of considered. Although historically non-metal cannulae have been considerably more expensive there is now little difference between metal and Teflon-coated catheters. This review recommends the use of non-metal cannulae in preference to butterfly needles.","metal; politef; polyurethan; clinical trial; comparative study; human; infusion; instrumentation; needle; palliative therapy; review; subcutaneous drug administration; Clinical Trials; Humans; Infusions, Parenteral; Injections, Subcutaneous; Metals; Needles; Palliative Care; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Polyurethanes"

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings. © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",fluorocarbon; adult; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; human; meta analysis; metabolic syndrome X; pollutant; toxicity; Adult; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome
NA,A review on per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) in microplastic and food-contact materials,2022,NA,NA,"Plastic, paper and cardboard are widely used as food contact materials (FCMs), due to its numerous favourable characteristics. However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil-and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs.",NA

Therefore, advanced technologies for tertiary wastewater treatment have been widely studied in recent decades. These treatments have been reviewed over the years mainly providing comparisons from a technical perspective. However, there is a lack of a holistic evaluation considering environmental and economic aspects together with the aforementioned technical aspects. In this review, treatment alternatives for micropollutant and pathogen abatement have been identified based on technologies implemented on a large scale (ozonation, ultraviolet treatment, adsorption on activated carbon or membrane filtration) as well as those treatments in the process of implementation, such as electrochemical, Fenton-based or photocatalytic techniques. Thus, a systematic bibliographic search was performed considering works applying pilot and full-scale equipment, leaving lab-scale results out of the analysis. The description of each process allowed the identification of the technical feasibility, operating costs and associated environmental impacts, providing a comparative assessment that will help decision-making in the development and application of the different technologies. The benchmarking results reveal that the selected treatment should be chosen based on the source and specific pollutants present in the wastewater, as there is no single solution for the treatment of micropollutants and pathogens. In addition, recommendations are presented for the publication of reliable process-related data to facilitate comparison between different technologies and treatment scenarios. © 2022 The Authors",NA

To use the P(CF3)2- ion in nucleophilic substitution reactions, it is necessary to reduce the negative hyperconjugation, which is associated with a C-F activation. For this reason we synthesized different bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphanido complexes of mercury, silver and tungsten and investigated their use in nucleophilic substitution reactions. The most reactive compound, resulting from this study so far, is the pentacarbonylbis(trifluoromethyl)phosphanidotungstenate, [W{P(CF3)2}(CO)5]-, which exhibits nearly the same bonding situation for the P(CF3)2 unit as in the free P(CF3)2- ion. For use in synthesis of bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphane derivatives, Lewis acids are desirable, which stabilize the P(CF3)2- ion by an intermediary formation of a donor acceptor adduct and can be split off after the synthesis of bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphane derivatives, as could be achieved using the extremely weak Lewis acids, CS2 and acetone. These results could be established in the synthesis of the first example of an chiral, bidentate bis(trifluoromethyl)phosphane derivative. To synthesize a chiral, bidentate bis(pentafluorophenyl)phosphane derivative, a different synthetic strategy is necessary that does not involve the P(C6F5)2- ion, which decomposes even at low temperature. The implementation of functional P(CN)2- ions leads to the synthesis of functional, chiral bidentate dicyanophosphane derivatives which finally can be transformed into the corresponding bis(pentafluorophenyl)phosphane derivatives. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Besides this tendency to get systemic lupus erythematosus there is an increased tendency to develop immune complex glomerulonephritis and one case of a further putative immune complex disease, Henoch Schonlein purpura, was described. In this case it seems likely that the infective agent, an unclassified mycoplasma, is the antigen. Although the significance of these associations is far from clear it can be conjectured that the complement deficiency leads to some subtle immunity deficiency allowing the persistence of chronic non virulent infections to produce their harmful defects by giving rise to immune complex disease. The effects of deficiencies in the activation of the alternative pathway remain to be described since such deficiencies are not yet known. Deficiencies that lead to interference with efficient C3 activation are associated with severe life endangering bacterial infections and it is fairly clear that in the days before efficient antibiotic therapy such patients would not have survived long enough to be studied. There is certainly no mystery about the adaptive value of this part of the complement sequence. However even severe disturbance of C3 activation does not seem to produce any obvious defect in the capacity of the affected patients to synthesize antibodies. Deficiencies at the C5, 6, 7 stage of the complement sequence are well tolerated and in the cases so far described in man no obvious clinical correlate has been found. From the investigation of animals with these deficiencies at this stage there are hints that failure to lyse nucleated cells and/or platelets in vivo may in certain circumstances produce pathological effects. Deficiencies of C8 and C9 were not observed.","complement; complement component c1; angioneurotic edema; complement deficiency; complement system; diagnosis; drug deficiency; hypogammaglobulinemia; immune deficiency; kidney disease; lupus erythematosus; normal value; review; skin disease; theoretical study; Adolescent; Adult; Angioneurotic Edema; Animal; Antibodies, Antinuclear; Bacterial Infections; Child; Complement; Enzyme Activation; Female; Guinea Pigs; Human; Immunogenetics; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Mice; Phagocytosis; Rabbits; Skin"

Generally it is formed by the union of the ventral primary rami of the spinal nerves, C5-C8 and T1, the so-called 'roots' of the brachial plexus. The goal here is to examine the neural architecture of the brachial plexus. The most constant arrangement of nerve fibers will be delineated, and then the predominant variations in neural architecture will be defined, particularly the prefixed and postfixed plexus, as well as the microanatomy and anatomy of the major terminal branches of the plexus. Multiple tracts connect many parts of the nervous system, and multiple ascending and descending tracts connect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and lower spinal centers with the brain. This reflects that the nervous system is able to extract different pieces of sensory information from its surroundings and encode them separately, and that it is able to control specific aspects of motor behavior using different sets of neurons. Examination of the major sensory or motor pathways reveals a highly and tightly organized nervous system. In particular, at each of many levels, we see fairly exact maps of the world within the brain. In an effort to understand the functional neuroanatomy of the brachial plexus, this paper will focus briefly on the nervous connections of the nerves of the upper extremity with the brain.

Both reactions are related to the weight of the used mesh. All materials may lead to specific complications. These include seroma formation, infection, migration of the prosthesis with arrosion of organs, damage of the vas deferens, development of recurrency by shrinkage of the fibers around the mesh, formation of adhesions in the preperitoneal position, and chronic inguinal pain. Therefore, meshes should be used only after individual estimation of risks and benefit.

More than 45 genes encoding the proteins of complement components or their isotypes and subunits, receptors, and regulators have been discovered. These genes are distributed throughout different chromosomes, with 19 genes comprising three significant complement gene clusters in the human genome. Genetic deficiency of any early component of the classical pathway (C1q, C1r/s, C2, C4, and C3) is associated with autoimmune diseases due to the failure of clearance of immune complexes (IC) and apoptotic materials, and the impairment of normal humoral response. Deficiencies of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and the early components of the alternative (factor D, properdin) and terminal pathways (from C3 onward components: C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) increase susceptibility to infections and their recurrence. While the association of MBL deficiency with a number of autoimmune and infectious disorders has been well established, the effects of the deficiency of other lectin pathway components (ficolins, MASPs) have been less extensively investigated due to our incomplete knowledge of the genetic background of such deficiencies and the functional activity of those components. For complement regulators and receptors, the consequences of their genetic deficiency vary depending on their specific involvement in the regulatory or signalling steps within the complement cascade and beyond. This article reviews current knowledge and concepts about the genetic load of complement component deficiencies and their association with diseases.

Despite this high diversity, all PFAS are alike in that they contain perfluoroalkyl moieties that are extremely resistant to environmental and metabolic degradation. The vast majority of PFAS are therefore either non-degradable or transform ultimately into stable terminal transformation products (which are still PFAS). Under the European chemicals regulation this classifies PFAS as very persistent substances (vP). We argue that this high persistence is sufficient concern for their management as a chemical class, and for all ""non-essential""uses of PFAS to be phased out. The continual release of highly persistent PFAS will result in increasing concentrations and increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects. Once adverse effects are identified, the exposure and associated effects will not be easily reversible. Reversing PFAS contamination will be technically challenging, energy intensive, and costly for society, as is evident in the efforts to remove PFAS from contaminated land and drinking water sources.

First conceptualised in 2001, much progress has been made to make wastewater analysis (WWA) a reliable and robust tool for measuring chemical consumption and/or exposure. At the moment, the most popular application of WWA, sometimes referred as sewage epidemiology, is to monitor the consumption of illicit drugs in communities around the globe, including China. The approach has been largely adopted by law enforcement agencies as a device to monitor the temporal and geographical patterns of drug consumption. In the future, the methodology can be extended to other chemicals including biomarkers of population health (e.g. environmental or oxidative stress biomarkers, lifestyle indicators or medications that are taken by different demographic groups) and pollutants that people are exposed to (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated chemicals, and toxic pesticides). The extension of WWA to a huge range of chemicals may give rise to a field called sewage chemical-information mining (SCIM) with unexplored potentials. China has many densely populated cities with thousands of sewage treatment plants which are favourable for applying WWA/SCIM in order to help relevant authorities gather information about illicit drug consumption and population health status. However, there are some prerequisites and uncertainties of the methodology that should be addressed for SCIM to reach its full potential in China. © 2014 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biomarkers; Catchments; Chemicals; Health; Indicators (chemical); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Sewage treatment plants; Drug consumption; Geographical patterns; Innovative approaches; Law-enforcement agencies; Oxidative stress biomarkers; Perfluorinated chemicals; Population health; Wastewater analysis; Chemical analysis; biomarker; chemical analysis; drug; public health; wastewater; China; street drug; waste water; water pollutant; analysis; China; environmental monitoring; human; waste water; water pollutant; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Street Drugs; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The soil–plant system plays an important role in the bioaccumulation of PFASs. Because most PFASs in the natural environment are anionic and amphiphilic (both lipophilic and hydrophilic), their sorption and accumulation behaviors differ from those of neutral organic and common ionic compounds. In this review, we discuss processes affecting the availability of PFASs in soil after analyzing the potential mechanisms underlying the sorption and uptake of PFASs in the soil–plant system. We also summarize the current knowledge on root uptake and translocation of PFASs in plants. We found that the root concentration factor of PFASs for plants grown in soil was not significantly correlated with hydrophobicity, whereas the translocation factor was significantly and negatively correlated with PFAS hydrophobicity regardless of whether plants were grown hydroponically or in soil. Further research on the cationic, neutral, and zwitterionic forms of diverse PFASs is urgently needed to comprehensively understand the environmental fates of PFASs in the soil–plant system. Additional research directions are suggested, including the development of more accurate models and techniques to evaluate the bioavailability of PFASs, the effects of root exudates and rhizosphere microbiota on the bioavailability and plant uptake of PFASs, and the roles of different plant organelles, lipids, and proteins in the accumulation of PFASs by plants. © 2021",Health risks; Hydrophobicity; Soils; Sorption; Amphiphilics; Ecosystem health; Human health; Natural environments; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Potential risks; Root uptake; Soil plant systems; Translocation; Uptake; Biochemistry; organic carbon; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; chemical pollutant; hydrophobicity; rhizosphere; root system; soil pollution; soil quality; sorption; translocation; abiotic stress; absorption; apoplast; bioavailability; concentration (parameter); correlational study; hydrophobicity; hydroponics; lipid metabolism; nonhuman; pH; plant growth; plant metabolism; priority journal; protein metabolism; Review; rhizosphere microbiome; root growth; root respiration; soil change; soil pollution; soil temperature; symplast; ecosystem; human; plant; soil; soil pollutant; Microbiota; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants

Trifluoroacetic acid is (1) produced naturally and synthetically, (2) used in the chemical industry, and (3) a potential environmental breakdown product of a large number (>1 million) chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and polymers. The contribution of these chemicals to global amounts of TFA is uncertain, in contrast to that from HCFC and HFC regulated under the MP. TFA salts are stable in the environment and accumulate in terminal sinks such as playas, salt lakes, and oceans, where the only process for loss of water is evaporation. Total contribution to existing amounts of TFA in the oceans as a result of the continued use of HCFCs, HFCs, and hydrofluoroolefines (HFOs) up to 2050 is estimated to be a small fraction (<7.5%) of the approximately 0.2 μg acid equivalents/L estimated to be present at the start of the millennium. As an acid or as a salt TFA is low to moderately toxic to a range of organisms. Based on current projections of future use of HCFCs and HFCs, the amount of TFA formed in the troposphere from substances regulated under the MP is too small to be a risk to the health of humans and environment. However, the formation of TFA derived from degradation of HCFC and HFC warrants continued attention, in part because of a long environmental lifetime and due many other potential but highly uncertain sources. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",alkene derivative; bicalutamide; celecoxib; chemical compound; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; efavirenz; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluoxetine; hydrofluoroolefin derivative; perfluoro compound; pesticide; rain; reagent; snow; sodium chloride; surface water; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; water; inorganic salt; pollutant; trifluoroacetic acid; aquatic species; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; chemistry; ecosystem; ecotoxicity; environment; environmental exposure; environmental impact; evaporation; food chain; health hazard; human; mammal; nonhuman; physical chemistry; radiometric dating; Review; risk; risk assessment; salt lake; sea; soil; solubility; terrestrial species; troposphere; uncertainty; water loss; analysis; animal; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; pollutant; Animals; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Salts; Trifluoroacetic Acid

Both the direct installation of the O−R f and S−R f groups (R f =CF 3 , CF 2 H) and the exploitation of building blocks featuring these groups are detailed. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In experienced centers the procedure is combined with low risk and high success rates. A well known and unresolved problem is the tendency of the stents to clog within a few months, recessitating their replacement. The best survival of the stents is achieved by using the largest straight teflon stent without sideholes. Long-term treatment with antibiotics, antimicrobial impregnated stents, stents without side holes or intraductally placed stents might increase the survival of the stents. Great experience is necessary in order to ensure optimal endoscopic treatment of all the patients with malignant common bile duct obstruction and the treatment therefore should be performed in few large centers.","common bile duct disease; digestive tract endoscopy; human; methodology; obstructive jaundice; pancreas tumor; prostheses and orthoses; radiography; review; stent; Cholestasis, Extrahepatic; Common Bile Duct Diseases; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Prostheses and Implants; Stents"

This has been acknowledged in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which proposes to regulate the release of chemicals to the environment and names specific indicators focusing on pesticides, nutrients and plastic waste. We fully welcome the inclusion of these substances but would like to further emphasize that in order to protect biodiversity from hazardous chemicals, the scope of Target 7 should feature a wider range of pollutants that can contribute to biodiversity loss. We propose the inclusion of non-agricultural biocides, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), toxic metal(loid)s, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Furthermore, data on emerging pollutants (e.g., rare earth elements, toxic and persistent industrial chemicals, liquid crystal monomers, pharmaceuticals, personal care products) need to be regularly reviewed with the aim to integrate additional pollutants to Target 7 in the case of biodiversity risk. We suggest to amend Target 7 to postulate the aim for the overall reduction of chemical production and emissions, as well as the addition of the aforementioned substance groups of high concern to biodiversity for integration in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. We further elaborate on different strategies for the reduction of emissions of hazardous chemicals through chemical simplification and grouping, reduction of chemicals with non-essential use, and innovative synthesis strategies (e.g., “benign-by-design”). In this context, the full life cycle of chemicals (i.e., production, use, and end of life) needs to be considered. Lastly, we propose to set up transparent data inventories, in cooperation with the industry, to inform about the production, transport and emissions of chemicals, which can serve as a basis for indicators related to monitoring the progress towards achieving the goals set under Target 7. © 2023 RSC.",NA

The presence of actin, tubulin, and intermediate filament homologs in these relatively simple cells suggests that primitive cytoskeletons first arose in bacteria.

Here, we review recent studies in which proteins have been designed that incorporate highly fluorinated analogs of hydrophobic amino acids with the aim of creating proteins with novel chemical and biological properties. Fluorination seems to be a general and effective strategy to enhance the stability of proteins, both soluble and membrane bound, against chemical and thermal denaturation, although retaining structure and biological activity. Most studies have focused on small proteins that can be produced by peptide synthesis as synthesis of large proteins containing specifically fluorinated residues remains challenging.

Biogas (primarily containing methane and CO2), which is generated from waste biomass via anaerobic digestion or landfills, is regarded as a renewable source of methane, and has the potential to achieve sustainable production of transportation fuels. Since biogas also contains a significant amount of impurities (e.g., H2S, NH3, and siloxane), a cleaning procedure is generally required prior to conversion to transportation fuels. Physical approaches, mainly compression and liquefaction, have been commercially applied to upgrade biogas to bio-compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied biogas (LBG). For chemical approaches, catalytic reforming is the dominant method for converting methane to syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or fermentation of syngas to a variety of alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels). High purity hydrogen, a clean fuel, can also be produced via reforming. Methanol can be produced by direct oxidation of methane, while interest in the biological conversion of methane to methanol has grown recently due to its mild operating conditions, high conversion efficiency, and potential for using raw biogas. The derived methanol can be further converted to gasoline via a methanol to gasoline (MTG) process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of major research progress on technologies for converting biogas/methane into transportation fuels, and discusses the principles, kinetics, operating conditions, and performance of each technology. Efficient direct conversion of biogas into ethanol and higher alcohol fuels (e.g. butanol), which is envisaged to be the focus of research pursuits in the near future, is also discussed, with emphasis on the development of methane-utilizing microbes through genetic engineering. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, they have several technical challenges: reactants permeability, which results in reduced performance, dependence on water content to perform preventing the operation at higher temperatures or low humidity levels, and chemical degradation. This paper reviews novel composite membranes that have been developed for PEM applications, including direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), hydrogen PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs), and water electrolysers (PEMWEs), aiming at overcoming the drawbacks of the commercial Nafion membranes. It provides a broad overview of the Nafion-based membranes, with organic and inorganic fillers, and non-fluorinated membranes available in the literature for which various main properties (proton conductivity, crossover, maximum power density, and thermal stability) are reported. The studies on composite membranes demonstrate that they are suitable for PEM applications and can potentially compete with Nafion membranes in terms of performance and lifetime. © 2020 by the authors.

The common feature of these methods is the application of sulfinyl group as a chiral auxiliary to control the stereochemical outcome of the reactions under study. In particular, the following general methods are critically discussed: diastereoselective methylene transfer from diazomethane to the carbonyl of β-keto-γ-fluoroalkyl sulfoxides as a general approach for preparation of various α-fluoroalkyl α-sulfinylalkyl oxiranes. The resulting compounds were used as true chiral synthons for their further elaboration via oxidative or reductive desulfurization, to numerous fluorine-containing and biologically relevant amino- and hydroxy-containing derivatives. Another general approaches discussed here are asymmetric additions to C{double bond, long}N double bond. One of them is addition of chiral sulfoxide stabilized carbon nucleophiles to fluorine-containing imines, leading to convenient preparation of alpha-fluoroalkyl derivatives of alpha amino acids and amines. Another approach is asymmetric Reformatsky reaction between N-sulfinyl imines and ethyl bromodifluoroacetate allowing operationally convenient preparation of α,α-difluoro-β-amino acids in enantiomerically pure form. Finally, structurally similar but mechanistically different addition reactions of diethyl difluoromethylphosphonate to N-sulfinyl imines, as a general approach to asymmetric synthesis of α,α-difluoro-β-aminophosphonates and phosphonic acids, are discussed. Effect of fluorine on the mechanism and stereochemical outcome of these reactions is discussed in detail and compared, where it is possible, with that of the analogous reactions of fluorine-free substrates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

NA,Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and thyroid function in neonates: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2022,NA,NA,"Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

They illustrate the government's claim to decentralization, by granting greater autonomy to high performing organizations. The number of FTs has grown steadily, reaching 131 in September 2010, over 50% of eligible trusts. Despite this growth, and notwithstanding the fact that organizations which initially became FTs were previously high performing, doubts remain about the implementation of the FT policy. This article examines the implementation of FTs in the NHS and focuses on the nature and exercise of autonomy by FTs. It argues that the ability of FTs to exercise autonomy is in place, but the (relatively limited) extent of implementation may be explained by trusts' lack of willingness to exercise such autonomy. Such unwillingness may be because of continued centralization, unclear policy and financial regimes, fear of negative impacts on relations with other local organizations, and awareness of greater risk to the FT, among others. Addressing the tension between FTs' ability and willingness to exercise autonomy will largely explain the extent to which the government's provider side reforms will be implemented. © The Royal Society of Medicine Press Ltd 2011.",financial management; government; health care delivery; health care organization; health care policy; national health service; priority journal; review; trust; England; Foundations; Health Care Reform; Humans; Metaphor; Professional Autonomy; State Medicine

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of PGMC-based systemic delivery of Rapamycin on expression of p27 in vascular tissue and restenosis in porcine coronary arteries after stent implantation. Eight pigs underwent coronary stent implantation (three stents per animal). Five pigs were treated with i.v. injection of PGMC with 2 mg of Rapamycin and three animals served as control. Four hours postprocedure, three pigs were sacrificed and stented segments were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Western blot. In chronic experiments, five pigs (15 stent sites) were sacrificed at 28 days following intervention and vessels were perfusion-fixed. HPLC of the treated arteries demonstrated high drug concentration in the vessel tissue, and Western blot analysis showed elevated expression of p27 at 4 hr postprocedure. Histomorphometry revealed significantly reduced (by 40%) neointimal formation in the PGMC/Rapamycin group compared with controls (1.84 ± 0.84 vs. 4.77 ± 1.71 mm2, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). In the porcine coronary model, site-specific systemic delivery of Rapamycin utilizing PGMC resulted in overexpression of p27 and a significant reduction of neointimal formation within the stented segments. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","butane; drug carrier; perfluorobutane; rapamycin; unclassified drug; adhesion; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; controlled study; disease model; drug efficacy; drug tissue level; gas; high performance liquid chromatography; intima; morphometrics; nonhuman; protein expression; restenosis; review; swine; vascular tissue; Western blotting; Animals; Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation; Blotting, Western; Cell Cycle Proteins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Coronary Restenosis; Coronary Vessels; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Delivery Systems; Fluorocarbons; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Infusions, Intra-Arterial; Microbubbles; Sirolimus; Stents; Swine; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Tunica Intima"

The technology as an alternative to existing energy and chemical intensive treatments has attained maturity for treating contaminants from range of waste streams, under wide range of climates and conditions. Recent trend shows additional research interventions for better expansion of the technology such as energy harvesting to make the system a net energy producer by coupling CW to microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) and improved operation under climatically challenged condition. The assessment discusses treatment efficiency, bioelectricity production, improved electrode efficiency, performance variation w.r.t. Macrophyte, emerging pollutant removal and microbial community structure in CW-MFC, which reveal that carefully designed integrated CW-MFC with optimized system elements (electrode, spacing, separator, macrophyte, C source, rhizosphere microbes) are necessary for its more profitable futuristic application. Further, low temperature challenges of the technology and the strategies to achieve satisfactory low temperature performance were assessed. Successful implementation of the technology in cold climate calls for design of CW with incorporation of appropriate heat preservation method, active macrophyte or microbial consortia to work effectively under low temperature. Comparative evaluation of the technology with other treatment processes using Life cycle assessment (LCA) with cradle to grave approach (considering alternative substrates, energy harvesting, macrophyte use and disposal options) would further boost the technology penetration. Potential research areas that appear to be worth pursuing in future to obtain further gains in CW performance are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Electrodes; Electrophysiology; Energy harvesting; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Microorganisms; Soils; Temperature; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Wetlands; Coldest temperatures; Condition; Ecotechnology; Environmental services; Fuel cell integration; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle impacts; Lows-temperatures; Macrophytes; Water security; Microbial fuel cells

This paper gives a comprehensive review of available human PBTK models for compounds selected as a priority by the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). We highlight their advantages and deficiencies and suggest steps for advanced internal dose modelling. The review of the available PBTK models highlighted the conceptual differences between older models compared to the ones developed recently, reflecting commensurate differences in research questions. Due to the lack of coordinated strategies for deriving useful biomonitoring data for toxicokinetic properties, significant problems in model parameterisation still remain; these are further increased by the lack of human toxicokinetic data due to ethics issues. Finally, questions arise as well as to the extent they are really representative of interindividual variability. QSARs for toxicokinetic properties is a complementary approach for PBTK model parameterisation, especially for data poor chemicals. This approach could be expanded to model chemico-biological interactions such as intestinal absorption and renal clearance; this could serve the development of more complex generic PBTK models that could be applied to newly derived chemicals. Another gap identified is the framework for mixture interaction terms among compounds that could eventually interact in metabolism. From the review it was concluded that efforts should be shifted toward the development of generic multi-compartmental and multi-route models, supported by targeted biomonitoring coupled with parameterisation by both QSAR approach and experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) data for newly developed and data poor compounds. © 2019","aniline; bromine derivative; cadmium; chlorpyrifos; chromium derivative; flame retardant; perfluoro compound; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; absorption; biomonitoring; developmental biology; dose-response relationship; metabolism; modeling; physiology; toxicology; biological monitoring; experimental model; intestine absorption; metabolism; physiologically based pharmacokinetic model; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; renal clearance; Review; toxicokinetics; biological model; biological monitoring; human; Biological Monitoring; Humans; Models, Biological; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Toxicokinetics"

Obligate intracellular bacteria replicate exclusively within the interior of living cells, an osmotically protected niche. Under these conditions peptidoglycan is not necessarily needed to maintain the integrity of the bacterial cell. Moreover, the presence of peptidoglycan puts bacteria at risk of detection and destruction by host peptidoglycan recognition factors and downstream effectors. This has resulted in a selective pressure and opportunity to reduce the levels of peptidoglycan. In this review we have analysed the occurrence of genes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism across the major obligate intracellular bacterial species. From this comparative analysis, we have identified a group of predicted ‘peptidoglycan-intermediate’ organisms that includes the Chlamydiae, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Wolbachia and Anaplasma marginale. This grouping is likely to reflect biological differences in their infection cycle compared with peptidoglycan-negative obligate intracellular bacteria such as Ehrlichia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, as well as obligate intracellular bacteria with classical peptidoglycan such as Coxiella, Buchnera and members of the Rickettsia genus.

Conventional treatment systems do not entirely remove EDCs from discharge effluent. Due to the ultra-trace level of EDCs which affect human health and pose an environmental issue, developing new approaches and techniques to remove these micropollutants from the discharged effluent is vital. This review discusses the most common methods of eliminating EDCs through preliminary, primary, secondary and tertiary treatments. The adsorption process is favoured for EDC removal, as it is an economical and straightforward option. The NABC aspects, which are the need, approach, benefits and challenges, were analysed based on existing circumstances, highlighting biochar as a green and renewable adsorbent for the removal of organic contaminants. From the environmental point of view, the effectiveness of this method, which uses natural fibre from the kenaf plant as a porous and economical biochar material with a selected lignocellulosic biomass, provides insights into the advantages of biochar-derived adsorbents. Essentially, the improvement of the natural fibre as an adsorbent is a focus, using carbonisation, activation, and the physiochemical process to enhance the adsorption ability of the material for pollutants in bodies of water.

Awassi, a common FTS breed in many Mediterranean countries, is adaptive and suitable to live in harsh conditions of the arid and semiarid areas. One of the main constraints for sheep industry in those areas is the limited supply and variable quality and quantity of feedstuffs. Using several alternative feedstuffs (AF) has been a common practice to decrease production cost of Awassi sheep industry in those areas. The appropriate AF to be used is determined by several animal and feed factors. These AF includes, but not limited to, unconventional feedstuffs, agricultural byproducts, and agro-industrial byproducts. A good body of literature about the use of AF and the effects of such use on performance of Awassi sheep is available. Some of these AF have been shown to be safely used in Awassi diets with no detrimental effects on sheep performance or health and, thus, recommended to lower the production cost. Other AF has controversial effects and recommendations. This paper reviews the effects of using AF on performance of Awassi ewes and lambs. Effects on intake, nutrient digestibilities, growth rate, and carcass characteristics of lambs and on intake, nutrient digestibilities, body weight change, milk yield, and milk composition of ewes will be emphasized. Recommendations and limitations for using AF will also be briefly discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","animal; animal food; body weight; chemistry; eating; economics; growth, development and aging; meat; milk; physiology; review; sheep; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Body Weight; Eating; Meat; Milk; Sheep, Domestic; Animalia; Ovis aries"

It is only for Factor B and Factor D of the alternative pathway that homozygous deficiency states are not so far known. Complement deficiency states provide the most direct way of looking at the role of the complement system in vivo and emphasize the importance of complement in resistance to bacterial infection and in particular to infection with Neisseria. This association is not unexpected since in vitro studies have shown complement to be an efficient enhancer of phagocytosis and inflammation. The particularly frequent occurrence of neisserial infection may be ascribed to the ability of these organisms to survive in phagocytic cells so that the plasma cytolytic activity provided by complement is needed to kill them. On the other hand the strong association between complement deficiencies and immune-complex diseases--especially systemic lupus erythematosus--was unexpected and seems paradoxical in view of the large part played by complement in the pathogenesis of immune complex mediated tissue damage. The paradox can be explained in part by the necessity for an intact complement system in the solubilization and the proper handling of immune complexes. It is also likely that complement deficiency can allow the persistence of low virulence organisms that produce disease solely by an immune complex mechanism. Recently described deficiencies of complement receptors and their effects in vivo are described.","complement; complement component C1s inhibitor; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; blood donor; genetics; hemolysis; human; immune complex disease; immune deficiency; immunology; meningococcosis; physiology; review; systemic lupus erythematosus; Blood Donors; Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins; Complement C6; Complement C7; Complement C8; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Complement System Proteins; Hemolysis; Humans; Immune Complex Diseases; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Meningococcal Infections; Receptors, Complement; Receptors, Complement 3b"

These compounds are lipophilic, hydrophobic, nondegradable, and tend to bioaccumulate. The family of PBDEs consists of 209 isomers or congeners and their chemical structure, persistence and distribution in the environment follow similar patterns than the polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The main application of PBDEs is as flame retardants. They are added to electronics, appliances, textiles, furniture, carpets, construction materials and polymers. Globally, North America is the main consumer of the most toxic BDEs mix (penta-BDE) for humans and environment. The highest concentrations of PBDEs have been reported in the USA in wastewater and sewage sludge. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, similar concentrations of PBDEs to those of the USA were found in wastewater influents. There are no regulations for PBDEs monitoring, usage and disposal. However, some countries have eliminated and decreased the production and usage of this type of compounds. The aims of this paper were to review the most important aspects of these pollutants, to analyze the concentrations previously reported in wastewater and sewage sludge and to verify its environmental regulations in Mexico. © 2015, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

To fully evaluate either the relative persistence or bioaccumulation potential of any APE, degradation intermediates and metabolic by-products of these compounds should also be considered. To facilitate the evaluation of the ultimate fate of APE in the environment, a review of the degradation pathways and identification of degradation intermediates was performed (part I of a two-part series). In part II of this series, the relative persistence of APE as indicated by degradation half-lives was examined based on a review of abiotic and biological degradation data. To assess the bioaccumulation potential of APE, the relevant literature was also reviewed.

Inhalational exposure to metal-containing fumes generated by welding and related processes may result in the development of the clinical syndrome known as ""metal fume fever."" Polymer fume fever is a separate and distinct but related disorder that has been associated with inhalational exposure to specific fluorinated polymer products, such as polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon®. We undertook a review of the peer-reviewed medical literature as it relates to these two disease entities in order to describe their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis. Methodology. We performed a search of the PubMed (www.pubmed.com) and Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) databases for keywords ""metal fume fever,"" ""polymer fume fever,"" and ""fume fever,"" covering the period 1946 to September 2014, which resulted in a total of 141 citations. Limiting the search to articles published in the English language yielded 115 citations. These 115 articles were manually reviewed for relevance. In addition, the reference lists in each article retrieved were reviewed for additional relevant references. This left 48 relevant citations. Epidemiology. Metal fume fever occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in individuals who perform welding and other metal-joining activities for a living. It is estimated that 1,5002,500 cases of metal fume fever occur annually in the United States. Polymer fume fever was initially identified as an occupational disease but increased regulations have resulted in decreased incidence in the occupational setting. Overheating of Teflon®-coated cookware is one of the more common mechanisms for exposure. Pathophysiology. While the precise pathophysiology associated with the development of metal fume fever is yet to be elucidated, suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms include pro-inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil activation, and oxygen radical formation. The pathophysiologic mechanism for polymer fume fever has not been definitively elucidated but may involve similar mechanisms to those proposed for metal fume fever. Clinical presentation. Metal fume fever typically presents with generally non-specific complaints including influenza-like symptoms, fever, shaking chills, arthalgias, myalgias, headache, and malaise. Onset of symptoms typically occurs 410 h following the exposure to metal-containing fumes. While metal fume fever is typically benign and self-limited, severe cases of the disease have been reported. In patients with ongoing metal fume exposure over the course of a workweek, tachyphylaxis occurs resulting in improvement in symptoms over the course of the workweek and maximal symptoms occurring after an exposure-free period such as a weekend. The clinical presentation of polymer fume fever is indistinguishable from metal fume fever, with an exposure history being necessary to distinguish the two entities. Diagnosis. Chest radiographs are typically normal in cases of metal fume fever and polymer fume fever; however, mild vascular congestion may be demonstrated and severe cases may feature diffuse patchy infiltrates. Laboratory studies are typically not necessary but may demonstrate leukocytosis with leftward shift or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment. The primary treatment for both metal fume fever and polymer fume fever is supportive and directed at symptom relief. Oral hydration, rest, and the use of antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin) are recommended. A careful workplace exposure assessment analysis conducted by an occupational medicine specialist or clinical toxicologist in concert with a qualified industrial hygienist should be performed. Prevention. A careful workplace exposure assessment including measurement of ambient zinc and other metal (e.g., chrome, nickel, copper and manganese) fume concentrations or concentrations of fluorocarbon polymer decomposition products at different locations within the workplace should be performed. Prognosis. Metal fume fever is typically a benign and self-limited disease entity that resolves over 1248 h following cessation of exposure. Conclusions. Metal and polymer fume fevers generally follow a benign course with spontaneous resolution of symptoms, though both have the potential to be serious, especially in those with significant preexisting cardiorespiratory disease. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",acetylsalicylic acid; aluminum; antimony; antipyretic agent; beryllium; boron; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; fluorocarbon; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; metal; nickel; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; oxygen radical; politef; polymer; selenium; tin; vanadium; zinc; artificial ventilation; chill; clinical feature; cytokine release; endotracheal intubation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fever; flu like syndrome; headache; human; leukocyte activation; leukocytosis; malaise; metal fume fever; myalgia; occupational disease; occupational exposure; oral rehydration therapy; pathophysiology; polymer fume fever; prognosis; rest; Review; symptom; systematic review; tachyphylaxis; thorax radiography; venous congestion; welding fume; working time

FtsZ (the tubulin homolog) and MreB/ParM (the actin homologs) are indispensable for cellular tasks that require the cell to accurately position molecules, similar to the function of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. FtsZ is the organizing molecule of bacterial cell division and forms a filamentous ring around the middle of the cell. Many molecules, including MinCDE, Su1A, ZipA, and FtsA, assist with this process directly. Recently, genes much more similar to tubulin than to FtsZ have been identified in Verrucomicrobia. MreB forms helices underneath the inner membrane and probably defines the shape of the cell by positioning transmembrane and periplasmic cell wall-synthesizing enzymes. Currently, no interacting proteins are known for MreB and its relatives that help these proteins polymerize or depolymerize at certain times and places inside the cell. It is anticipated that MreB-interacting proteins exist in analogy to the large number of actin binding proteins in eukaryotes. ParM (a plasmid-borne actin homolog) is directly involved in pushing certain single-copy plasmids to the opposite poles by ParR/parC-assisted polymerization into double-helical filaments, much like the filaments formed by actin, F-actin.

It leads to reduced food intake, retarded growth, intestinal disequilibrium, lower reproductive performance, immunity and endocrine disorders in livestock and poultry. Many studies show that the pathogenesis of heat stress is mainly related to oxidative stress, hormone secretion disorder, cytokine imbalance, cell apoptosis, cell autophagy, and abnormal cell function. Its mechanism refers to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, the fluctuation of tight junction protein and heat shock protein expression, and protein epigenetic modification.

The key for an integrated representation is through a well-defined force field and Hamiltonian at the molecular level. In developing coarse-grained intermolecular potential functions for the fluid state, one typically starts with a detailed, bottom-up quantum-mechanical or atomic-level description and then integrates out the unwanted degrees of freedom using a variety of techniques; an iterative heuristic simulation procedure is then used to refine the parameters of the model. By contrast, with a top-down technique, one can use an accurate EoS to link the macroscopic properties of the fluid and the force-field parameters. We discuss the latest developments in a top-down representation of fluids, with a particular focus on a group-contribution formulation of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT-γ). The accurate SAFT-γ EoS is used to estimate the parameters of the Mie force field, which can then be used with confidence in direct molecular simulations to obtain thermodynamic, structural, interfacial, and dynamical properties that are otherwise inaccessible from the EoS.

This requires identifying the factors and understanding how they mechanistically influence COVID-19. Here, we describe how eleven selected factors (age, sex, genetic factors, lipid disorders, heart failure, gut dysbiosis, diet, vitamin D deficiency, air pollution and exposure to chemicals) influence COVID-19 by applying the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP), which is well-established in regulatory toxicology. This framework aims to model the sequence of events leading to an adverse health outcome. Several linear AOPs depicting pathways from the binding of the virus to ACE2 up to clinical outcomes observed in COVID-19 have been developed and integrated into a network offering a unique overview of the mechanisms underlying the disease. As SARS-CoV-2 infectibility and ACE2 activity are the major starting points and inflammatory response is central in the development of COVID-19, we evaluated how those eleven intrinsic and extrinsic factors modulate those processes impacting clinical outcomes. Applying this AOP-aligned approach enables the identification of current knowledge gaps orientating for further research and allows to propose biomarkers to identify of high-risk patients.

Each kind of Fe-based materials could be functionalized in the most suitable catalysis field, wherever Mössbauer technique may play a unique role. For instance, Fe-N-C based materials are extensively investigated as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and Mössbauer spectroscopy application in this field has been utilized to identify the chemical nature of the active site on the Fe-N-C catalyst. Iron carbides are considered as the most active phase for FTS and Mössbauer technique is widely applied in determining the chemical phase of catalysts. Fe-based silicates, phosphates or polyanionic compounds are recognized as promising cathode materials for LIBs, for which Mössbauer technique has been mainly applied for tracking of the oxidation state and coordination environment change of Fe between charged and discharged states of the batteries. Similar phenomena can also be found in other catalysis fields. To give a clear understanding of which field is most suitable for a certain Fe-based catalyst and the best role of the Mössbauer technique in a certain catalysis field associated with the investigation of the mechanism, in this review, the recent advances of applying Mössbauer technique in catalysis are thoroughly summarized, including results from environmental catalysis and energy catalysis.

Costs and contaminant concerns (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS]) are challenging widely used landfilling and land application practices. These circumstances are partly driving the re-emergence of pyrolysis and gasification technologies along with beneficial reuse prospects of the char solid residual. Previously, technologies experienced operational challenges leading to revised configurations, such as directly coupling a thermal oxidizer to the reactor to destroy tar forming compounds. This paper provides an overview of pyrolysis and gasification technologies, characteristics of the char product, air emission considerations, and potential fate of PFAS and other pollutants through the systems. Results from a survey of viable suppliers illustrate differences in commercially available options. Additional research is required to validate performance over the long-term operation and confirm contaminant fate, which will help determine whether resurging interest in pyrolysis and gasification warrants widespread adoption. Practitioner Points: Pyrolysis and gasification systems are re-emerging in the wastewater industry. Direct coupling of thermal oxidizers and other modifications offered by contemporary systems aim to overcome past failures. Process conditions when coupled with a thermal oxidizer will likely destroy most organic contaminants, including PFAS, but requires additional research.

These agents serve close retinal breaks, confine eventual retinal redetachment, and prevent proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Long-acting gases and silicone oil are effective internal tamponade agents; however, because their specific gravity is lower than that of the vitreous fluid, they may provide adequate support for the superior retina but lack efficacy for the inferior retina, especially when the fill is subtotal. Thus, a specific role may exist for an internal tamponade agent with a higher specific gravity, such as heavy silicone oils (HSOs), Densiron 68, Oxane HD, HWS 45-300, HWS 46-3000, and HeavySil. Some clinical evidence seems to presume that heavy tamponades are more prone to intraocular inflammation than standard silicone if they remain in the eye for several months. In this review, we discuss the fundamental clinical and biochemical/molecular mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response after the use of heavy tamponade: toxicity due to impurities or instability of the agent, direct toxicity and immunogenicity, oil emulsification, and mechanical injury due to gravity. The physical and chemical properties of various HSOs and their efficacy and safety profiles are also described. © 2014 Francesco Morescalchi et al.",fluorosilicone; perfluorohexyloctane; silicone oil; silicone oil; drug impurity; drug stability; emulsion; eye inflammation; eye toxicity; human; immunogenicity; multicenter study (topic); nonhuman; randomized controlled trial (topic); relative density; review; animal; chemistry; inflammation; rabbit; uveitis; Animals; Humans; Inflammation; Rabbits; Silicone Oils; Uveitis

These treatments require detailed knowledge of the spatial location and distribution of cardiac autonomic nerves, however, there are controversies on this subject in humans. Objective: To provide a systematic overview of current knowledge on human anatomy of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Results: In contrast to the often claimed assumption that human preganglionic sympathetic cardiac neurons originate mainly from thoracic spinal segments T1–T4 or T5, there is ample evidence indicating involvement of cervical spinal segment C8 and thoracic spinal segments below T5. Whether cervical ganglia besides the stellate ganglion play a role in transmission of cardiac sympathetic signals is unclear. Similarly, there is debate on the origin of cardiac nerves from different thoracic ganglia. Most human studies report thoracic cardiac nerves emerging from the first to fourth thoracic paravertebral ganglia; others report contributions from the fifth, sixth and even the seventh thoracic ganglia. There is no agreement on the precise composition of nerve plexuses at the cardiac level. After years of debate, it is generally accepted that the vagal nerve contributes to ventricular innervation. Vagal distribution appears higher in atria, whereas adrenergic fibers exceed the number of vagal fibers in the ventricles. Conclusion: Anatomy of the human cardiac autonomic nervous system is highly variable and likely extends beyond generally assumed boundaries. This information is relevant for thoracic epidural anesthesia and procedures targeting neuronal modulation of cardiac sympathetic innervation. © 2020 The Authors","adrenergic nerve; adult; cardiac ganglion; cervical ganglion; cervical spine; heart atrium; heart function; heart nerve; human; neuromodulation; review; stellate ganglion; sympathetic blocking; sympathetic innervation; thoracic ganglion; thorax epidural anesthesia; vagus nerve; anatomy and histology; animal; autonomic nervous system; heart; innervation; physiology; sympathetic ganglion; Adult; Animals; Autonomic Nervous System; Ganglia, Sympathetic; Heart; Humans"

This requirement implies adapting monitoring locations and density, and monitoring frequency. It might also imply adapting monitoring techniques by integrating alternative screening methods and emerging tools for monitoring water quality to complement existing monitoring.We present the results of five European case studies that explored the potential uses of screening methods and emerging tools for responding to the new monitoring challenges of the WFD under different hydrological and environmental conditions. Combining their technical characteristics with the practical needs identified by monitoring experts and water stakeholders, we identified potential applications and opportunities for operational and investigative monitoring.

Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected.

A recent study on pregnant women suggested that PFC exposure was associated with a longer time to pregnancy (TTP). We examined the association between serum concentrations of PFCs in females and TTP in 222 Danish first-time pregnancy planners during the years 19921995.Methods The couples were enrolled in the study when discontinuing birth control and followed for six menstrual cycles or until a clinically recognized pregnancy occurred. Fecundability ratio (FR) was calculated using discrete-time survival models. In addition, odds ratio (OR) for TTP >6 cycles was calculated. Results OR for TTP >6 cycles for those with PFC concentrations above the median were 0.96 [95 confidence interval (CI): 0.541.64] for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the major PFC, compared with those below the median. FRs for those with PFOS concentrations above the median were 1.05 (95 CI: 0.741.48) compared with those below the median. Other PFCs showed the same lack of association with TTP. The results were not affected by adjustment for covariates. PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations were similar to those observed in a previous Danish study.

NA,Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the regulation of energy balance,2017,NA,NA,"Energy balance involves the adjustment of food intake, energy expenditure and body fat reserves through homeostatic pathways. These pathways include a multitude of biochemical reactions, as well as hormonal cues. Dysfunction of this homeostatic control system results in common metabolism-related pathologies, which include obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are a particular class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals that affect energy homeostasis. MDCs affect multiple endocrine mechanisms and thus different cell types that are implicated in metabolic control. MDCs affect gene expression and the biosynthesis of key enzymes, hormones and adipokines that are essential for controlling energy homeostasis. This multifaceted spectrum of actions precludes compensatory responses and favours metabolic disorders. Herein, we review the main mechanisms used by MDCs to alter energy balance.

Utilizing this unique property, we have developed a fluorous derivatization with a liquid chromatographic analysis method for highly selective analysis of target analytes. Although most previous methods focused on extremely sensitive detection-oriented derivatization, the fluorous derivatization method involves highly specific separation for analytes. This method includes perfluoroalkylation of analytes with a fluorous reagent, and separation of the derivatives using a perfluoroalkyl-modified stationary phase LC column. The derivatives can be selectively retained on the fluorous-phase LC column, whereas the non-fluorous derivatives are poorly retained under the same separation conditions. The combination of this method with LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is very useful for complex biological sample analysis, because matrix-induced suppression effects, which are a common problem in LC-MS/MS analysis arising from components of a biological endogenous matrix, have not been observed. We have successfully applied this method to precise and accurate LC-MS/MS analysis of some biogenic com- pounds, such as sialic acids and biogenic amines, in complex biological samples. © 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","biogenic amine; sialic acid; fluorescent dye; derivatization; liquid chromatography; perfluoroalkylation; Review; tandem mass spectrometry; chemistry; human; oral drug administration; publication; vaccination; Administration, Oral; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Vaccination"

NA,Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in integrated crop–livestock systems: Environmental exposure and human health risks,2021,NA,NA,"Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent synthetic organic contaminants that can cause serious human health concerns such as obesity, liver damage, kidney cancer, hypertension, immunotoxicity and other human health issues. Integrated crop–livestock systems combine agricultural crop production with milk and/or meat production and processing. Key sources of PFAS in these systems include firefighting foams near military bases, wastewater sludge and industrial discharge. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances regularly move from soils to nearby surface water and/or groundwater because of their high mobility and persistence. Irrigating crops or managing livestock for milk and meat production using adjacent waters can be detrimental to human health. The presence of PFAS in both groundwater and milk have been reported in dairy production states (e.g., Wisconsin and New Mexico) across the United States. Although there is a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water by the U.S. EPA, there are not yet regional screening guidelines for conducting risk assessments of livestock watering as well as the soil and plant matrix. This systematic review includes (i) the sources, impacts and challenges of PFAS in integrated crop–livestock systems, (ii) safety measures and protocols for sampling soil, water and plants for determining PFAS concentration in exposed integrated crop–livestock systems and (iii) the assessment, measurement and evaluation of human health risks related to PFAS exposure. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups con-sidered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cad-mium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma. Therefore, more research about exposure to environmental chemicals and risk of asthma is needed. © 2021 by the authors.

The dynamic adsorption behavior may be governed by a two-step process: (1) the transfer of molecules between the surface layer and the subsurface layer, which has a thickness of a few molecular diameters only; (2) the exchange of molecules between the subsurface and the bulk solution. The first step is an adsorption process and the second step is a mass transfer process. Between the subsurface and the bulk solution is an undisturbed boundary layer where mass transport occurs by diffusion only. The thickness of this boundary layer may be reduced by stirring. Rapid film formation by adsorption bursts from lipid extract surfactants, as observed in the captive bubble system, suggests that the adsorption process as defined above is accompanied by a relatively large negative change in the free energy. This reduction in the free energy is provided by a configurational change in the association of the specific surfactant proteins and the surfactant lipids during adsorption. The negative change in the free energy during film formation more than compensates for the energy barrier related to the film surface pressure. In the traditional view, the extracellular alveolar lining layer is composed of two parts, an aqueous subphase and a surfactant film, believed to be a monolayer, at the air-water interface. The existence and continuity of the aqueous subphase has recently been demonstrated by Bastacky and coworkers, and a continuous polymorphous film has recently been shown by Bachofen and his associates, using perfusion fixation of rabbit lungs with slight edema. In the present chapter, we have described a fixation technique using a non-aqueous fixation medium of perfluorocarbon and osmium tetroxide to fix the peripheral airspaces of guinea pig lungs. A continuous osmiophilic film which covers the entire alveolar surface, including the pores of Kohn, is demonstrated. By transmission electron microscopy, the surface film frequently appears multilaminated, not only in the alveolar corners or crevices, but also at the thin air-blood barrier above the capillaries. Disk-like structures or multilamellar vesicles appear partially integrated into the planar multilayered film. In corners and crevices, tubular myelin appears closely associated with the surface film. Tubular myelin, however, is not necessary for the generation of a multilaminated film. This is demonstrated in vitro by the fixation for electron microscopy of a film formed from lipid extract surfactant on a captive bubble. Films formed from relatively high surfactant concentration (1 mg/ml of phospholipid) are of variable thickness and frequent multilayers are seen. In contrast, at 0.3 mg/ml, only an amorphous film can be visualized. Although near zero minimum surface tensions can be obtained for both surfactant concentrations, film compressibility and mechanical stability are substantially better at the higher concentrations. This appears to be related to the multilaminated structure of the film formed at the higher concentration.

The different systems make adaptations based on natural selection. With respect to the immune system of mammals, these changes have a lot to do with the interactions that occur continuously with other living species, especially microorganisms. The immune system is primarily designed to defend from germs and this response triggers inflammatory reactions which must be regulated in order not to generate damage to healthy tissue. The regulatory processes were added over time to prevent such damage. Through evolution the species have stored an immunological experience, which provides information that is important for developing effective responses in the future. The human species, which is at a high level of evolutionary immunological accumulation, have multiple immune defense strategies which, in turn, are highly regulated.

The interest in FTS depends on current and perceived future prices of crude oil but is increasingly viewed as an option for exploiting stranded natural gas. Other advantages of FTS hydrocarbons include the absence of sulphur, nitrogen, heavy metal contaminants, low aromatic content and the ability to produce high value middle distillates/fuels. Current interest is directed towards slurry bubble processes - comprising gas, liquid, and solid phases. Industrial slurry phase FTS reactors may range in size from 6 - 10 m in diameter and upwards of 30 m in height and include multiple internal heat transfer tubes. Such systems offer numerous advantages including high heat transfer rates, good mixing, and ease of online catalyst addition and withdrawal. However, one disadvantage is the complex hydrodynamics associated with slurry bubble columns, which make scale-up difficult. A literature review on heat transfer studies and correlations has been completed focusing on previous experimental setups, the synthesis of the key findings/parameters, and the identification of the necessary criteria required for reactor design and scale-up. The parameters having the most pronounced impact on heat transfer in slurry bubble columns and three-phase fluidized beds are the superficial gas velocity and liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension, which significantly alter the bubble properties and the column hydrodynamics. The effect of particles is poorly understood and is a complex function of particle diameter and concentration. The experimental results and correlations reported here from the majority of studies are dependent upon the equipment and properties of the three phases studied - resulting in very limited applicability to other systems or for scale-up. Other concerns include the use of relatively low gas velocities, ambient temperature and pressure, relatively large particles, and relatively small columns employed in most studies, which are not relevant to industrial operating conditions. Furthermore, studies involving multiple internals were relatively few. Most columns were only equipped with a single tube or small heat flux probe thereby measuring only the local heat transfer and not taking into account the effect on column hydrodynamics of multiple internals. Of these studies only a few tubes were equipped with heaters (that did not run the entire tube length) and heat flux probes while the remaining probes were inactive. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004–2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. Future research on the impacts of these external factors is urgently needed.

With the increasing restrictions on PFAS in Europe and the United States, the production of PFAS is gradually transferring to China. The amount of PFAS used in China is increasing year by year, but there are no strict restrictions on the use of them. Furthermore, the safety limits are heading down in Europe and the United States. Based on the updated safety limits, studies in Chinese population have gradually indicated the potential risk of PFAS. This review summarizes the updated international safety limits, and introduces the research progress in health risk assessment of PFAS exposure in Chinese population according to different sources of exposure (diet, milk, drinking water, dust, atmosphere, placental transfer and comprehensive sources). The existing studies mainly focus on the health risk of PFAS exposure in high PFAS-polluted areas and in sensitive infant population in China, while the health risk of PFAS exposure in general population still needs to be further evaluated. It is necessary to carry out relevant work, which can provide reference for relevant government departments to formulate PFAS control standards and safety limits in line with China's national conditions as soon as possible. In addition, the future assessment research should pay more attention to complex evaluation of various sources of PFAS and the health hazards of PFAS alternatives. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

NA,"Are persistent organic pollutants linked to lipid abnormalities, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease? A review",2020,NA,NA,"The term persistent organic pollutants (POPs) denotes chemicals with known or suspected adverse health effects in animals or humans and with chemical properties that make them accumulate in the environment, including animals or humans. Lipid-soluble POPs, like dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides are transported by lipoproteins and accumulate in adipose tissue. High levels of these compounds in the circulation have been associated with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in cross-sectional studies and with an increase in mainly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a longitudinal study. Also, non-lipid-soluble POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) compounds have been associated with increased total cholesterol levels. Carotid artery atherosclerosis has been related to elevated levels of mainly highly chlorinated PCBs and to highly fluorinated PFASs, but in this case only in women. Both cross-sectional and prospective studies have shown dioxins, PCBs, as well as PFASs to be linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. In conclusion, as highlighted in this review, several lines of evidence support the view that POPs of different chemical classes could be linked to lipid abnormalities, carotid atherosclerosis and overt CVD like myocardial infarction and stroke. © 2020 The Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis.",NA

Negative contaminant removal i.e., higher concentrations (up to 5731%) of these ECs in the effluent with respect to the influent sampled on the same occasions, is globally prevalent in almost all types of treatment systems. Conventional WWTPs showed the highest negative removal (NR) for Carbamazepine, and Carbadox. Conjugation–deconjugation, types of WWTPs, transformations, leaching, operational parameters, sampling schemes, and nature of substance governs the NR efficiencies. Among the various categories of micropollutants, pesticides and beta-blockers are reported to exhibit the maximum percentage of NR, posing threat to human and the environment.

An association of a reduction of vaccination efficacy with PFAS serum levels in humans was used by the European Food Safety Authority as a key effect for PFAS risk assessment. The data support for using this association is reviewed by a critical analysis of the respective human epidemiology and the available animal studies on the immunomodulation of PFAS. Based on an analysis of the available human epidemiology, the overall level of evidence regarding associations between PFAS serum levels and reduced antibody response remains weak. Absence of an association between an increase in clinical infections and PFAS serum levels and the limited understanding of the importance of antibody levels as an isolated data point further support this conclusion. Animal toxicity studies with PFAS focusing on immunomodulation also provide only limited support for immunomodulation as an important endpoint in PFAS toxicity. While immunomodulation is observed after PFAS administration, generally at blood concentrations several orders of magnitude above those seen in environmentally exposed humans, the relevance of these observation is hampered by the high doses required to influence immune endpoints, the limited number of endpoints assessed, and inconsistent results. The limitations of the current database on associations of human PFAS exposures outlined here indicate that more evidence is required to select immunomodulation as a critical endpoint for human PFAS risk assessment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",antibody response; blood level; controlled study; drug megadose; drug safety; environmental exposure; fluorination; food safety; human; human tissue; immunomodulation; review; risk assessment; vaccination; animal; chemistry; immunomodulation; pollutant; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Immunomodulation

It is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases by causing cellular injury and tissue inflammation, resulting in sclerosis and fibrosis. These deleterious effects are, consequently, targeted in the development of novel therapies that inhibit the formation of C5b-9, such as eculizumab. To clarify how C5b-9 contributes to kidney disease and to predict which patients benefit from such therapy, knowledge on deposition of C5b-9 in the kidney is essential. Because immunohistochemical staining of C5b-9 has not been routinely conducted and never been compared across studies, we provide a review of studies on deposition of C5b-9 in healthy and diseased human kidneys. We describe techniques to stain deposits and compare the occurrence of deposits in healthy kidneys and in a wide spectrum of kidney diseases, including hypertensive nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, C3 glomerulopathy, and thrombotic microangiopathies such as the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, kidney tumors, and rejection of kidney transplants. We summarize how these deposits are related with other histological lesions and clinical characteristics.

Kieler bones, which are made from bovine bones are the oldest preparation. Kieler bones consist of up to 30% protein. This gives the bone elasticity but may also involve immunogenic reactions to the implant. Calcium phosphate, in the form of synthetic or semi-synthetic hydroxyapatite or hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate, is, on the other hand, quite inelastic which makes these implants unsuitable in regions with mechanical stress. Proplast consists of carbon fibres coated with Teflon and may be employed for subperiostal reconstructions. BOP is a new system of synthetic materials built up from polyamide fibres and/or absorbable matrix. This system combines mechanical strength with ingrowth of bone but, as yet, experience with this material is only limited.

Ubiquitous exposures to PFAS, in consideration of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicities have led to concerns regarding possible harmful effects during critical periods of development in early-life and long-term consequences on health. The potential effects of PFAS depend on various factors including the type of PFAS and the timing and level of exposure. We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature to assess the effects of early-life PFAS exposure on prenatal and postnatal growth, adiposity, and puberty in children and adolescents. For birth size, most studies indicated that prenatal PFAS exposure, in particular long-chain PFAS, may impair fetal growth, albeit some reports of null associations with maternal PFAS. For growth within 2 years of age, prenatal PFAS exposure showed no associations with height and either null or negative associations with weight. However, postnatal PFAS exposures were inversely related to height and weight at 2 years in a cross-sectional study. For postnatal adiposity, prenatal PFAS may mostly have negative associations with body mass index in the first 2 years of life, but positive relationships with adiposity in childhood and adolescence, although some studies showed null associations. For puberty, the evidence for associations between early-life PFAS exposure and pubertal development or sex hormone levels were limited and inconclusive. From experimental studies, plausible mechanisms through which PFAS may affect early-life growth and puberty include PFAS-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, alterations of thyroid or steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, and their weak estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties. Although the published literature suggests possible effects of PFAS exposures on early-life growth, adiposity, and puberty, current human evidence is limited in establishing PFAS-induced effects on early-life physical development. Further investigation is warranted to clarify PFAS-induced effects on growth and physical development in consideration of the critical time-window of exposure, concomitant exposure to chemical mixtures including various PFAS types, and possible non-monotonic dose-response relationship for growth and adiposity trajectories. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Jung, Kim, Choi and Lee.",alkyl group; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; polyfluoroalkyl substance; steroid hormone; testosterone; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; birth length; birth weight; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; childhood obesity; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; environmental exposure; fetus growth; fluorination; gestational age; hormone metabolism; hormone synthesis; human; long term exposure; menarche; meta analysis; physical parameters; ponderal index; postnatal growth; precocious puberty; prenatal exposure; Review; risk assessment; skinfold thickness; systematic review; waist circumference; waist to height ratio

Ingestion of foods containing high amounts of animal fat is the main route of human exposure to lipophilic chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants, which tend to bioaccumulate in the lipid compartment. Bioaccumulation results in increased exposure of these chemicals for humans, but particularly to breastfeeding infants, who are at the top of the food chain. The extent to which food contributes to a person's overall exposure depends on individual dietary habits and the concentrations of chemical residues in the food. These, in turn, are affected by (1) application methods, (2) properties and amounts of the chemical, and (3) preparation, handling, and the properties of the food. Once the food is ingested by the lactating woman, the chemical's pharmacokinetics and the transport mechanisms producing the movement of solutes across mammary alveolar cells determine the passage of chemicals from the blood to the milk. Thus, several factors affect the presence in human milk of environmental chemicals from dietary sources.

Long retention times in lakes mean pollutants from discharges slowly circulate around the lakes and may lead to high ecological risk for ecosystem and human health. In recent decades, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants. The occurrence and distribution of antibiotics and ARGs in global freshwater lakes are summarized to show the pollution level of antibiotics and ARGs and to identify some of the potential risks to ecosystem and human health. Fifty-seven antibiotics were reported at least once in the studied lakes. Our meta-analysis shows that sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfameter, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, and roxithromycin were found at high concentrations in both lake water and lake sediment. There is no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamides in lake water from China and that from other countries worldwide; however, there was a significant difference in quinolones. Erythromycin had the lowest predicted hazardous concentration for 5% of the species (HC5) and the highest ecological risk in lakes. There was no significant difference in the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) in lake water and river water. There is surprisingly limited research on the role of aquatic biota in propagation of ARGs in freshwater lakes. As an environment that is susceptible to cumulative build-up of pollutants, lakes provide an important environment to study the fate of antibiotics and transport of ARGs with a broad range of niches including bacterial community, aquatic plants and animals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Amides; Antibiotics; Aquatic organisms; Ecosystems; Genes; Health risks; Lakes; River pollution; Sulfur compounds; Water; Antibiotic resistance genes; Aquatic biota; Meta analysis; Niche; Species sensitivity distributions; Lake pollution; antibiotic agent; erythromycin; lake water; lincosamide; macrolide; oxytetracycline; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; river water; roxithromycin; sulfamerazine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfametoxydiazine; sulfonamide; tetracycline; trimethoprim derivative; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; biota; lake pollution; meta-analysis; sensitivity analysis; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance gene; China; concentration (parameters); ecology; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; gene; geographic distribution; health hazard; lake; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; sediment; sul1 gene; sul2 gene; systematic review; water analysis; water pollution; analysis; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; drug effect; genetics; meta analysis; microbiology; China; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Geologic Sediments; Lakes"

It is orchestrated by a variety of genes, proteins, and external and internal factors, especially epigenetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-acknowledged epigenetic modulators that regulate the translation and degradation of target genes in the nervous system. Increasing evidence has suggested that a number of miRNAs play important roles in modulating various aspects of synaptic plasticity. The deregulation of miRNAs could be associated with pathological alterations in synaptic plasticity, which could lead to different CNS-related diseases. Herein, we provide an update on the role of miRNAs in governing synaptic plasticity. In addition, we also summarize recent researches on the role of miRNAs in drug addiction, and their targets and mechanism of action. Understanding of the way in which miRNAs contribute to synaptic plasticity provides rational clues in establishing the novel biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of plasticity-related diseases and drug addiction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",cocaine; diamorphine; diethyltoluamide; leptin; let 7a; let 7b; let 7c; let 7d; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6; melatonin; microRNA; microRNA 122; microRNA 124; microRNA 126; microRNA 132; microrna 134; microrna 137; microrna 138; microrna 140; microrna 181a; microrna 195; microrna 196a; microrna 199a; microrna 206; microrna 212; microrna 218; microrna 219; microRNA 22; microRNA 221; microrna 23; microRNA 26a; microRNA 29b; microrna 30a; microrna 30a 5p; microrna 30c; microrna 3119; microrna 34; microrna 384 5p; microrna 3942; microrna 4704; microrna 4743; microrna 495; microrna 514; microrna 602; microRNA 9; microrna 98; morphine; mu opiate receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; neuropilin; nimodipine; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; permethrin; pyridostigmine; resveratrol; scopolamine; serotonin; small untranslated RNA; tetrodotoxin; unclassified drug; microRNA; alcohol abuse; biogenesis; cocaine dependence; cognition; drug dependence; epigenetics; gene control; gene expression; human; long term depression; long term potentiation; MAPK signaling; mental disease; microrna biogenesis; nerve cell plasticity; nerve degeneration; protein phosphorylation; Review; schizophrenia; synaptic transmission; Wnt signaling; central nervous system disease; drug dependence; genetics; metabolism; nerve cell; nerve cell plasticity; synapse; Central Nervous System Diseases; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Substance-Related Disorders; Synapses

Since then several genes have been discovered, which now account for around 25% of cases with the clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PAH. Despite the ongoing efforts, in the majority of patients the cause of the disease remains elusive, a phenomenon often referred to as “missing heritability”. In this review, we discuss research approaches to uncover the genetic architecture of PAH starting with forward phenotyping, which in a research setting should focus on stable intermediate phenotypes, forward and reverse genetics, and finally reverse phenotyping.

Owing to their persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) characteristics, PFOS has been phased out by its principal producer and the use of PFOA has been reduced. This PBT potential and a number of pollution incidents have led in recent years to an increase in studies surveying the concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in environmental waters worldwide. This paper reviews the results of these studies, as well as the monitoring that was conducted after the pollution incidents. The results of surveys suggest that PFOS and PFOA are found in environmental waters worldwide at low levels. In general, these levels are below health-based values set by international authoritative bodies for drinking water. There have been limited measurements of these chemicals in drinking water, but again these are below health-based values, except in some cases following pollution incidents. Monitoring studies suggested that where PFOS and PFOA were detected, they were at similar levels in both source and drinking water, suggesting that drinking water treatment does not remove these chemicals. However, new data show that PFOS and PFOA are effectively removed by granular activated carbon absorbers in practice. Further research is required on the newer perfluorinated chemicals that appear to be safer, but their degradation products have not as yet been fully studied. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Acids; Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bioaccumulation; Chemical water treatment; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Consumer products; Degradation; Industrial chemicals; Monitoring; Surface active agents; Degradation products; Drinking water; Drinking water treatment; Environmental water; Environmental waters; Granular activated carbon absorbers; Low level; Perfluorinated chemicals; Perfluorooctane sulphonate; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Pollution incidents; Potable water; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; chemistry; China; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Germany; Italy; Japan; methodology; pollutant; review; United Kingdom; United States; water management; water pollutant; water supply; Alkanesulfonic Acids; China; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Germany; Great Britain; Italy; Japan; Octanoic Acids; United States; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Supply"

This review evaluates the application of SAs for the generation of products that can serve as (i) antimicrobial agents or disinfectants, (ii) materials for civil construction, (iii) catalysts, (iv) fertilizers, and (v) secondary adsorbents. The importance of SAs configuration in terms of functional groups, surface area and pore morphology played a crucial role in their reutilization. The SAs-laden silver ions (Ag+) strongly inhibit (~ 99%) the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus microbes found in drinking and wastewaters. The intra-solidification of SAs containing toxic metal pollutants (As3+ and F−) with cementitious materials can effectively reduce their leaching below permissible limits of USEPA standards for their utility as additives in construction work. The existence of transition metal ions (Cu2+, Cr3+/6+, Ni2+) on the surface of SAs boosted activity and selectivity towards the desired product during catalytic oxidation, degradation, and conversion processes. The thermally recycled SAs can assist in the secondary adsorption of pollutants from another waste solution due to a larger surface area (&gt; 1000 m2g−1). However, there are chances that the SAs discussed above will contain traces of PFAS. The article summarizes the challenges, performance efficacy, and future prospects at the end of each value-added product. We also highlight critical challenges for managing PFAS-laden SAs and stimulate new perspectives to minimize PFAS in air, water, and soils.

Moreover, while the compounds referred to as “legacy” PFAS remain in the environment, alternative compounds have emerged as replacements for their legacy predecessors and are now detected in numerous matrices.

The unique ultrastructures that support cell-cell interactions in the testis are the basal ES (ectoplas-mic specialization) and the apical ES. The basal ES is found between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane that also constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The apical ES is restrictively expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid contact site in the apical (adluminal) compartment of the sem-iniferous epithelium. These ultrastructures are present in both rodent and human testes, but the majority of studies found in the literature were done in rodent testes. As such, our discussion herein, unless otherwise specified, is focused on studies in testes of adult rats. Studies have shown that the testicular cell-cell interactions crucial to support spermatogenesis are mediated through distinctive signaling proteins and pathways, most notably involving FAK, Akt1/2 and Cdc42 GTPase. Thus, manipulation of some of these signaling proteins, such as FAK, through the use of phosphomimetic mutants for overexpression in Sertoli cell epithelium in vitro or in the testis in vivo, making FAK either constitutively active or inactive, we can modify the outcome of spermatogenesis. For instance, using the toxicant-induced Sertoli cell or testis injury in rats as study models, we can either block or rescue toxicant-induced infertility through overexpression of p-FAK-Y397 or p-FAK-Y407 (and their mutants), including the use of specific activator(s) of the involved signaling proteins against pAkt1/2. These findings thus illustrate that a potential therapeutic approach can be developed to manage toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. In this review, we critically evaluate these recent findings, highlighting the direction for future investigations by bringing the laboratory-based research through a translation path to clinical investigations. © 2022 by the authors.

While perfluorinated polymer electrolytes have satisfactory properties for fuel cell applications, they limit commercial use due to significant high costs as well as reduced performance at high temperatures and low humidity. A promising alternative to obtain high performance proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membranes is through the use of hydrocarbon polymers. The need for inexpensive and efficient materials with high thermal and chemical stability, high ionic conductivity, miscibility with other polymers, and good mechanical strength is reviewed in this paper. Though it is difficult to evaluate the true cost of a product based on preliminary research, this paper will examine several of the more promising materials available as low cost alternatives to ion exchange membranes. These alternative membranes represent a new generation of cost effective electrolytes that can be used in various ion exchange systems.

NA,Life-Time Environmental Chemical Exposure and Obesity: Review of Epidemiological Studies Using Human Biomonitoring Methods.,2021,NA,NA,"The exponential global increase in the incidence of obesity may be partly attributable to environmental chemical (EC) exposure. Humans are constantly exposed to ECs, primarily through environmental components. This review compiled human epidemiological study findings of associations between blood and/or urinary exposure levels of ECs and anthropometric overweight and obesity indices. The findings reveal research gaps that should be addressed. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) for full text English articles published in 2006-2020 using the keywords ""environmental exposure"" and ""obesity"". A total of 821 articles were retrieved; 102 reported relationships between environmental exposure and obesity indices. ECs were the predominantly studied environmental exposure compounds. The ECs were grouped into phenols, phthalates, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to evaluate obesogenic roles. In total, 106 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized after an additional search by each group of EC combined with obesity in the PubMed and Scopus databases. Dose-dependent positive associations between bisphenol A (BPA) and various obesity indices were revealed. Both individual and summed di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and non-DEHP metabolites showed inconsistent associations with overweight and obesity indices, although mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) seem to have obesogenic roles in adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Maternal exposure levels of individual POP metabolites or congeners showed inconsistent associations, whereas dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were positively associated with obesity indices. There was insufficient evidence of associations between early childhood EC exposure and the subsequent development of overweight and obesity in late childhood. Overall, human evidence explicitly reveals the consistent obesogenic roles of BPA, DDE, and PFOA, but inconsistent roles of phthalate metabolites and other POPs. Further prospective studies may yield deeper insights into the overall scenario.",NA

A significant effort has been made by researchers towards proton conductive materials and membranes, some of which have been successfully commercialized. However, commercial perfluorosulfonic acid membranes like Nafion suffer key issues which limit their large-scale applications in a wide temperature range, including high cost and low operation temperature. Therefore, it is highly desirable to prepare new-type PEMs possessing high proton conductivity, thermal and chemical stability, water uptake and excellent durability. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive candidates for proton exchange membranes due to their high porosity, ordering pore structures and excellent designability. This review focuses on the recent progress on proton-conductive MOF structures and their proton exchange membranes. In the first section, the authors briefly introduce the proton conducting mechanism of MOFs and their testing methods. The Grotthuss mechanism refers to the proton transferring process in a continuous and long-range hydrogen network, whereas the Vehicular mechanism involves in the diffusion of proton carrier molecules. Then in the next section, the authors summarize the progress on bulk MOFs proton conductors. According to the work condition, proton-conducting MOFs can be divided into two types, namely working under humid and anhydrous environment. These works show the potential of proton-conductive MOFs to be applied in a wide temperature range, and some of them even have reached a relatively high conductivity larger than 10-2 S•cm-1, comparable with Nafion. In the third section, a review on the MOFs-based proton exchange membranes is shown. Researchers have proven that MOFs thin films have huge potential on proton conduction. Nevertheless, most of the MOFs-based PEMs are still mixed matrix membrane (MMM) structure. In order to boost the performance of MMMs-type MOFs-based PEMs, several strategies can be applied such as modifying MOF with functional groups, using 1D/2D MOFs structure and introducing the third phase into membranes.

Several injectable compounds have been used in a small number of patients during the 1940s and through the 1960s; however, the results were not very successful and often led to significant complications. More recently, two major materials have been developed that seem to be useful in treating stress incontinence by periurethral injection: Polytef paste and GAX collagen. Other injectables include autologous fat tissue and silicone microimplants. The most suitable patients for periurethral injection are elderly women, patients who constitute high operative risk, and those with stress incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter failure. Patients with stress incontinence due to a combination of urethral hypermobility and intrinsic sphincter deficiency with failure of suspension procedure may also benefit from the procedure. The reported long-term (more than 24 months) success rates according to the various substances are as follows: Teflon (Polytef) (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co, Wilmington, DE): 30 to 38 percent cured or improved; repeated injections usually do not improve the outcome; mostly minor complications with case reports of more serious side effects such as periurethral granuloma formation and bladder outlet obstruction. GAX collagen: 69 to 77 percent subjectively cured or improved after 24 months; 54 to 57 percent objectively cured or improved, the reported morbidity in these procedures is minimal; repeated injections can improve the outcome. The experience with autologous fat and silicone microimplants is insufficient, with an overall success rate of 70 percent (1-40 months follow-up; mean 12 months) and 58 to 70 percent (17-36 months), respectively. Most of the procedures are performed as outpatient cases, and some under local anesthesia. These procedures are minimally invasive, usually safe and well tolerated, require shorter hospitalization, and are cost effective. In conclusion, in carefully selected patients, periurethral injection seems to be a reasonable option in the modern treatment of female stress incontinence.","collagen; politef; silicone; adipose tissue; clinical trial; drug administration; female; human; review; silicone prosthesis; stress incontinence; urethra; urine incontinence; Adipose Tissue; Aged; Collagen; Female; Humans; Injections; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Prostheses and Implants; Silicone Elastomers; Urethra; Urinary Incontinence, Stress"

That was a century after the formulation of the concept and determination of the laws governing dialysis. The first step in the translation of the laboratory principles of dialysis to living animals was the ""vividiffusion"" apparatus developed by John Jacob Abel (1859-1938), dubbed the ""artificial kidney"" in the August 11, 1913 issue of The Times of London reporting the demonstration of vividiffusion by Abel at University College. The detailed article in the January 18, 1914 of the New York Times, reproduced here, is based on the subsequent medical reports published by Abel et al. Tentative attempts of human dialysis in the decade that followed based on the vividiffusion apparatus of Abel and his materials (collodion, hirudin, and glass) met with failure and had to be abandoned. Practical dialysis became possible in the 1940s and thereafter after cellophane, heparin, and teflon became available. Abel worked in an age of great progress and experimental work in the basic sciences that laid the foundations of science-driven medicine. It was a ""Heroic Age of Medicine,"" when medical discoveries and communicating them to the public were assuming increasing importance.

The first assumes that partitioning to membrane phospholipids, which have a higher affinity for charged species than neutral storage lipids, can explain the high bioaccumulation potential of these compounds. The second assumes that interactions with proteins-including serum albumin, liver fatty acid binding proteins (L-FABP), and organic anion transporters-determine the distribution, accumulation and half-lives of PFAAs. We consider three unique phenomena to evaluate the two models: (1) observed patterns of tissue distribution in the laboratory and field, (2) the relationship between perfluorinated chain length and bioaccumulation, and (3) species- and gender-specific variation in elimination half-lives. Through investigation of these three characteristics of PFAA bioaccumulation, we show the strengths and weaknesses of the two modeling approaches. We conclude that the models need not be mutually exclusive, but that protein interactions are needed to explain some important features of PFAA bioaccumulation. Although open questions remain, further research should include perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) beyond the long-chain PFAAs, as these substances are being phased out and replaced by a wide variety of PFASs with largely unknown properties and bioaccumulation behavior. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","Biochemistry; Phospholipids; Proteins; Bioaccumulation potential; Charged species; Fatty acid-binding proteins; Important features; Membrane phospholipids; Perfluorinated alkyl substances; Protein interaction; Tissue distributions; Bioaccumulation; fatty acid; fatty acid binding protein; liver fatty acid binding protein; organic anion transporter; perfluorinated alkyl acid; perfluoro compound; protein; serum albumin; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; hypothesis testing; numerical model; organic acid; phospholipid; protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; beluga whale; bioaccumulation; brain; cartilage; female; muscle; nonhuman; protein interaction; rainbow trout; rat; review; small intestine; stomach; tissue distribution; Animals; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Fluorocarbons; Half-Life; Humans; Models, Biological; Serum Albumin; Tissue Distribution"

The most well-known ultra-short-chain perfluoroalkyl acid is trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) which has been studied since the 1990s. Potential sources and the fate of ultra-short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids other than TFA are not well studied and data reporting their environmental occurrence is scarce. The analytical determination of ultra-short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids is challenging due to their high polarity resulting in low retention using reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Furthermore, recent studies have reported varying extraction recoveries in water samples depending on the water matrix and different methods have been suggested to increase the extraction recovery. The present review gives an overview of the currently used analytical methods and summarizes the findings regarding potential analytical challenges.

It examines the efficacy of a range of amendments, including those with binding agents, along with a discussion of immobilisation mechanisms and post-immobilisation assessment needs. Recent Findings: Researchers have recently applied a variety of soil amendments to soil for PFAS immobilisation. Efficacy of these has varied widely, both between amendment and soil types and for individual PFAS molecules present in contaminated soils. Activated carbon based amendments, including composite amendments exhibit the highest efficacies of the examined studies. Summary: Immobilisation of PFAS is complex, with efficacy of immobilisation varying with soil properties including pH, clay and organic matter content, amendment properties, and molecular properties of the individual PFAS. Optimal remediation strategies need to be adjusted accordingly to site specific soil properties and contamination profiles. Additionally, bioavailability testing needs to supplement standard leaching approaches to determine effectiveness of PFAS soil immobilisation strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA

As industrial microbes do not contain pathways to produce medium-chain chemicals, approaches such as overexpression of endogenous enzymes or deletion of competing pathways are not available to the metabolic engineer; instead, fatty acid synthesis and reversed -oxidation are manipulated to synthesize medium-chain chemical precursors. Even so, chain lengths remain difficult to control, which means that purification must be used to obtain the desired products, titers of which are typically low and rarely exceed milligrams per liter. By engineering the substrate specificity and activity of the pathway enzymes that generate the fatty acyl intermediates and chain-tailoring enzymes, researchers can boost the type and yield of medium-chain chemicals. Development of technologies to both manipulate chain-tailoring enzymes and to assay for products promises to enable the generation of g/L yields of medium-chain chemicals. © 2017 Nature Publishing Group.

Among environmental risk factors impinging on quality of life are those of chemical nature (toxic chemicals, heavy metals, pollutants, and pesticides) as well as those related to everyday life such as exposure to noise or mental and psychosocial stress. Recent Advances: This review elaborates on the relationship between miRNAs and these environmental risk factors. Critical Issues: The most relevant facts underlying the role of miRNAs in the response to these environmental stressors, including redox regulatory changes and oxidative stress, are highlighted and discussed. In the cases wherein miRNA mutations are relevant for this response, the pertinent literature is also reviewed.

Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) can be an important tool to derive recommendations for cultivation or handling of crops prior consumption. This review compiles >4500 soil-to-plant BAFs for 45 PFASs from 24 studies involving 27 genera of agricultural crops. Grasses (Poaceae) provided most BAFs with the highest number of values for perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. Influencing factors on PFAS transfer like compound-specific properties (hydrophobicity, chain length, functional group, etc.), plant species, compartments, and other boundary conditions are critically discussed. Throughout the literature, BAFs were higher for vegetative plant compartments than for reproductive and storage organs. Decreasing BAFs per additional perfluorinated carbon were clearly apparent for aboveground parts (up to 1.16 in grains) but not always for roots (partly down to zero). Combining all BAFs per single perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (C4-C14) and sulfonic acid (C4-C10), median log BAFs decreased by −0.25(±0.029) and −0.24(±0.013) per fluorinated carbon, respectively. For the first time, the plant uptake of ultra-short-chain (≤ C3) perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) was reviewed and showed a ubiquitous occurrence of trifluoroacetic acid in plants independent from the presence of other PFAAs. Based on identified knowledge gaps, it is suggested to focus on the uptake of precursors to PFAAs, PFAAs ≤C3, and additional emerging PFASs such as GenX or fluorinated ethers in future research. Studies regarding the uptake of PFASs by sugar cane, which accounts for about one fifth of the global crop production, are completely lacking and are also recommended. Furthermore, aqueous soil leachates should be tested as an alternative to the solvent extraction of soils as a base for BAF calculations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural robots; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Carbon; Crops; Soil pollution; Soils; Solvent extraction; Sugar cane; Sugar industry; Agricultural plants; Bioaccumulation factor; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Specific properties; Cultivation; alkyl group; carboxylic acid; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoropropionic acid; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; aqueous solution; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); crop plant; soil pollution; source apportionment; surfactant; agricultural species; bioaccumulation; cell membrane; chemical analysis; concentration (parameter); hydrophobicity; leaching; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; plant; plant cell; plant root; pollution transport; Review; shoot; soil pollution; species identification; agriculture; bioaccumulation; crop; soil; water pollutant; Poaceae; Saccharum; Agriculture; Bioaccumulation; Crops, Agricultural; Fluorocarbons; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

There are a number of different focal cerebral ischemia models that vary in their utility, pathophysiology of causing disease, and their response to treatments. Unfortunately, despite active preclinical research using these models, treatment options for ischemic stroke have not significantly advanced since the food and drug administration approval of tissue plasminogen activator in 1996. This review aims to summarize current stroke therapies, the preclinical experimental models used to help develop stroke therapies, as well as their advantages and limitations. In addition, this review discusses the potential for naturally occurring canine ischemic stroke models to compliment current preclinical models and to help bridge the translational gap between small mammal models and human clinical trials. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","acetylsalicylic acid; alcohol; alteplase; ancrod; caffeine; desmoteplase; disufenton sodium; endothelin 1; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; perfluoropentane; streptokinase; tissue plasminogen activator; bleeding; brain ischemia; cognition; craniectomy; dog; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; fibrinolytic therapy; human; induced hypothermia; Leporidae; mechanical thrombectomy; motor performance; neuroprotection; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; Review; sensorimotor function; therapy effect; thromboembolism; animal; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; complication; disease model; Animals; Brain Ischemia; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Stroke"

Remediating PFAS-contaminated soils is primarily limited to immobilization whereby the concentration of PFAS remains practically unaffected. Other remediation techniques include chemical and thermal methods, which are typically associated with very high costs and substantial energy usage requirements. A more cost-effective approach, however, could be to mobilize PFAS from the bulky soil to a medium (e.g., water, sorbents, plants) that can be sequentially treated or properly disposed of. Recent Findings: Soil washing, soil flushing, and liquefractionation are particularly promising mobilization approaches for treating permeable soils by desorbing the PFAS into a solution that can be subsequently treated, with liquefractionation generating the least wastewater volume. For cohesive soils, however, electrokinetic remediation would be more suitable for mobilizing PFAS. Another option could be phytoremediation, resulting in the confinement of PFAS in a small volume of plant parts which can be thermally converted into a valuable product, such as biochar, whereby PFAS is either adsorbed onto the carbonaceous matter or destroyed depending on the temperatures adopted. Summary: This review thoroughly discusses all mobilization techniques that can be used for treating PFAS-contaminated soils, while investigating the possibility of combining such techniques with other approaches to enhance the treatment efficiency. Unfortunately, research on coupling mobilization methods with other remediation techniques for treating PFAS-contaminated soils is significantly lacking, and thus, additional studies on the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches should be carried out while providing cost estimations in terms of removal efficiencies, process longevity, and waste regeneration or disposal. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA

Earlier mouse models emphasize the importance of autoreactive antibodies formed against ""self"" proteins that serve as a source for T cell-mediated immune response, stemming from cross-reactivity and resulting in B cell activity. However, more recent models suggest the need for both autoantibodies and the initiation of the inflammatory cascade via the alternative complement pathway, which is unbridled as the cartilage lacks the usual regulatory proteins of the complement system. Furthermore, deficiencies in specific complement proteins could lead to an escape from negative selection by these self-reactive B cells. Moreover, the classical complement pathway establishes chemotactic gradients by which inflammatory cells follow and accumulate in the synovial fluid where they engulf immune complexes and release proteolytic enzymes. In addition, the processing of circulating immune complexes either via Fc receptor or CR1 and opsonization by complement fragments plays a key role in determining the fate of immune status. In addition, complement proteins are a major determinant in the size and solubility of an immune complex, which also affects clearance. The evidence regarding intra-articular activation of the complement system in RA provides the possibility to pharmacologically manipulate various parts of the complement system for therapeutic purposes and potential therapeutic targets for the control of inflammation and the prevention of joint destruction. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","C reactive protein; collagen type 2; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C2; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; complement receptor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; mitogen activated protein kinase; STAT protein; tumor necrosis factor; acute phase response; antigen antibody complex; Arthus phenomenon; autoimmunity; cellular immunity; complement activation; complement system; cross reaction; cytokine production; effector cell; Epstein Barr virus; human; innate immunity; lymphocyte proliferation; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; pathophysiology; phagocytosis; priority journal; review; rheumatoid arthritis; T lymphocyte activation; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Complement System Proteins; Humans"

Greater ecological risks will be posed to the environment by PPCPs with the discharge of wastewater effluent, and PPCPs' bioaccumulation will ultimately endanger human health. So further deep purification techniques are needed to reduce the risk of PPCPs before entering into the environment. In this paper, the distribution characteristics and ecological risks of PPCPs in wastewater treatment are reviewed. Furthermore, the mechanism of treatments of PPCPs by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), biological activated carbon (BAC), AOPs coupled with BAC technologies (AOPs-BAC) is described. On this basis, the application and main influencing factors of AOPs-BAC for advanced treatment of PPCPs are reviewed.

NA,Persistent organic pollutants in typical lake ecosystems,2019,NA,NA,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic organic chemicals. Lakes are one of the main sinks of POPs. POPs can be accumulated in multiple matrices in lake ecosystems and biomagnified through the food web, and thus pose a potential threat not only to lake ecosystems, but also to human health. Given their potential persistent risks, they have received much attention over the past decades. This review comprehensively summarizes the data on the levels and distributions of POPs in selected typical lake ecosystems in China and worldwide, involving water, sediments, organisms, and surrounding soils and atmosphere. It was found that current publications on POPs in Chinese lakes are mainly related to lakes in the developed eastern plain area, with only a few studies concerning the less-developed Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area. Similarly, around the world, there are more research on POPs in developed countries and less in relatively less-developed areas. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of POPs in different matrices in different lake ecosystems. Legacy POPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were commonly detected and reported in different lakes, while emerging POPs like perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and hexabromocyclododecane (HCBD) were relatively less detected or reported. A comprehensive summarization on the levels and distributions of traditional and emerging POPs in lake ecosystems could be significant for further understanding the behaviors and risks of POPs in lake ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",NA

To effectively and quickly defend against potentially toxic agents without launching harmful immune responses, the liver relies on its strong innate immune system. This comprises enrichment of innate immune cells (such as macrophages, natural killer, natural killer T, and γδ T cells) and removal of waste molecules and immunologic elimination of microorganisms by liver endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. In addition, the liver also plays an important role in controlling systemic innate immunity through the biosynthesis of numerous soluble pathogen-recognition receptors and complement components. Conclusion: The liver is an organ with predominant innate immunity, playing an important role not only in host defenses against invading microorganisms and tumor transformation but also in liver injury and repair. Recent evidence suggests that innate immunity is also involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, providing novel therapeutic targets to treat such a liver disorder.

Virtually all children have been exposed to this virus by age two. RSV causes common cold symptoms in most patients. In vulnerable children, RSV can progress to bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia with an increased chance of significant morbidity or death. The nature of the virus and mode of infection protects it from the human immune system. Treatment for RSV is largely supportive. Key elements of treatment are maintenance of hydration, and oxygenation, as well as keeping the airways clear of mucus. Prevention of RSV in vulnerable infants is important because of the increased morbidity and mortality. A modest effort spent identifying vulnerable infants, educating the parents about RSV and its prevention, and providing immunoprophylaxis to those who qualify for it, increases the chances that these vulnerable children get through the first several years of life without RSV bronchiolitis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Despite that, there is a clear lack of assays to identify TH disruptors. Recently zebrafish embryos were suggested as screening tool to identify compounds which impact thyroid synthesis. Effects on hormone level, gene transcript expression, eye development and swim bladder inflation are suggested as potential biomarker for TH disruptors. In order to assess the applicability of these biomarkers we performed a literature review. The effects of 25 known TH disrupting compounds were compared between studies. The studies were limited to exposures with embryos prior 7 days of development. The different study designs and the lack of standardized methods complicated the comparison of the results. The most common responses were morphological alterations and gene transcript expression changes, but no specific biomarker for TH disruption could be identified. In studies addressing TH disruption behavioral effects were more commonly monitored than in studies not mentioning the TH pathway. TH disruption in developing zebrafish embryos might be caused by different modes of action e.g. disruption of follicle development, binding of TH, activation of TH receptors causing different effects. Timing of developmental processes in combination with exposure duration might also play a role. On the other side compound characteristics (uptake, stability, metabolization) could also cause differences between substances. Further studies are necessary to gain better understanding into the mechanisms of TH disruption in early zebrafish development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Endocrine disrupters; Gene expression; Hormones; Compound characteristics; Endocrine disruption; Follicle development; HPT axis; Morphological alteration; Standardized methods; Zebrafish development; Zebrafish embryos; Biomarkers; 2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',5 pentabromodiphenyl ether; 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl; 2,3',4,4',5 pentachlorobiphenyl; 2,4,6 tribromophenol; 4 hydroxy 2,2',3,4',5,5',6 heptachlorobiphenyl; 4 hydroxy 2,3,3',4',5 pentachlorobiphenyl; 4 nonylphenol; 5 hydroxy 2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; 6 hydroxy 2,2',4,4' pentabromodiphenyl ether; 6 hydroxy 2,2',4,4' tetrabromodiphenyl ether; biological marker; chloro 2 (2,4 dichlorophenoxy)phenol(triclosan); endocrine disruptor; pentachlorophenol; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononaoic acid; perfluorooctane sulfonamide; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; propyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid(propylparaben); tetrabromobisphenol A; thyroid hormone; thyroid hormone disruptor; unclassified drug; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; thyroid hormone; biomarker; cyprinid; embryo; endocrine disruptor; hormone; larva; literature review; binding affinity; embryo; exposure; gene expression; genetic transcription; metabolism; nonhuman; ovary follicle development; priority journal; Review; zebra fish; animal; drug effect; embryo development; embryology; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nonmammalian embryo; Danio rerio; Animals; Biomarkers; Embryo, Nonmammalian; Embryonic Development; Endocrine Disruptors; Thyroid Hormones; Zebrafish"

PFOS induces rapid disorganization of actin- and microtubule (MT)-based cytoskeletons in primary cultures of rodent and human Sertoli cells, perturbing Sertoli cell gap junction communication, thereby prohibiting Sertoli cells from maintaining cellular homeostasis in the seminiferous epithelium to support spermatogenesis. PFOS perturbs several signaling proteins/pathways, such as FAK and mTORC1/rpS6/Akt1/2. The use of either an activator of Akt1/2 or overexpression of a phosphomimetic (and constitutively active) mutant of FAK or connexin 43 has demonstrated that such treatment blocks PFOS-induced Sertoli cell injury by preventing actin- and MT-based cytoskeletal disorganization.

The relationship between exposure to environmental contaminants and adverse effects on human reproductive health are frequently debated in the scientific literature and these controversies have spread into the lay press drawing increased public and regulatory attention. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to critically evaluate the literature concerning the relationship between lifestyle exposures and adverse effects on fertility as well as examining the evidence for a role of environmental contaminants in the purported decline of semen quality and the pathophysiology of subfertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and endometriosis. The authors conclude that whereas cigarette smoking is strongly associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, high-level exposures to other lifestyle factors are only weakly linked with negative fertility impacts. Finally, there is no compelling evidence that environmental contaminants, at concentrations representative of the levels measured in contemporary biomonitoring studies, have any effect, positive or negative, on reproductive health in the general population. Further research using prospective study designs with robust sample sizes are needed to evaluate testable hypotheses that address the relationship between exposure and adverse reproductive health effects. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; alcohol; amphetamine; caffeine; cannabis; catecholamine; chlordiazepoxide; cocaine; diamorphine; estradiol; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; narcotic agent; nicotine; opiate; perfluoro compound; phencyclidine; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; prolactin; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; tetrahydrocannabinol; alcohol consumption; alcohol intoxication; alcoholism; biological monitoring; catecholamine release; cigarette smoking; endometriosis; environmental exposure; estradiol blood level; estrus cycle; feminization; fertility; follitropin blood level; health care access; hormone inhibition; human; lifestyle; low birth weight; male fertility; male infertility; nonhuman; nutritional deficiency; ovary insufficiency; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prolactin blood level; protein blood level; reproduction; reproductive health; review; sample size; semen analysis; smoking habit; sperm; spontaneous abortion; subfertility; substance abuse; teratology; testis weight; testosterone blood level; tobacco; Alcohol Drinking; Caffeine; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Marijuana Smoking; Reproduction; Risk Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum"

Providing sustainable and affordable treatment solutions to these problems is a need of the hour. Electrocoagulation (EC) technology is a burgeoning alternative for effective water treatment, which offers the virtues such as compact equipment, easy operation, and low sludge production. Compared to other water purification technologies, EC shows excellent removal efficacy for a wide range of contaminants in water and has great potential for addressing limitations of conventional water purification technologies. This review summarizes the latest development of principle, characteristics, and reactor design of EC. The design of key parameters including reactor shape, power supply type, current density, as well as electrode configuration is further elaborated. In particular, typical water treatment systems powered by renewable energy (solar photovoltaic and wind turbine systems) are proposed. Further, this review provides an overview on expanded application of EC in the removal of some newly concerned pollutants in recent years, including arsenite, perfluorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals, oil, bacteria, and viruses. The removal efficiency and mechanisms of these pollutants are also discussed. Finally, future research trend and focus are further recommended. This review can bridge the large knowledge gap for the EC application that is beneficial for environmental researchers and engineers. © 2021","bioreactor; coagulation; design; electrochemistry; electrode; pollutant removal; purification; water stress; water treatment; electrocoagulation; electrode; human; pollutant; technology; water management; water pollutant; Electrocoagulation; Electrodes; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Technology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

As our knowledge on their environmental and health impacts grow, PFAS have drawn increasing regulatory attention and research interest in recent years. While long-chain PFAS have been the center of active research in the past decade or so, and while industrial production and applications of short-china PFAS continue to rise, very few studies have focused on the occurrence, fate, and transformation of short-chain PFAS in the environment. This review aimed to provide an updated overview of the state of the science about the fundamentals, occurrence, impacts and treatment of short-chain PFAS. The key findings from this review include: 1) Short-chain PFAS are more widely detected, more persistent and mobile in aquatic systems, and thus may pose more risks on the human and ecosystem health; 2) conventional adsorption, ion-exchange, and membrane filtration can remove short-chain PFAS, but are less effective than the long-chain homologues, and are challenged with poor material regeneration efficiency and disposal of process waste residual; 3) advanced oxidation such as thermolysis and sonolysis can achieve complete mineralization, but come with a high process cost; and 4) direct photolysis, oxidation/reduction, photocatalysis, and electrochemical reaction may degrade short-chain PFAS following similar degradation pathways as long-chain PFAS, but at a slower rate, and photocatalytic processes appear most promising. Overall, this review reveals an urgent need for developing more cost-effective treatment technologies for short-chain PFAS in drinking water, for advancing our knowledge on the environmental fate, transport and impacts of short-chain PFAS in the environment, and for developing science-based regulations for short-chain PFAS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Aquatic ecosystems; Cost effectiveness; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Health risks; Industrial research; Ion exchange; Microfiltration; Organic pollutants; Photodegradation; Photolysis; Potable water; Waste disposal; Water pollution; Emerging contaminant; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); PFAS; PFOA; PFOS; Water treatment

Major advances in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have stimulated renewed interest in these osmotically fragile wall-less cells. Reliable procedures are available to isolate and culture protoplasts from a range of plants, including both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops. Several parameters, particularly the source tissue, culture medium, and environmental factors, influence the ability of protoplasts and protoplast-derived cells to express their totipotency and to develop into fertile plants. Importantly, novel approaches to maximise the efficiency of protoplast-to-plant systems include techniques already well established for animal and microbial cells, such as electrostimulation and exposure of protoplasts to surfactants and respiratory gas carriers, especially perfluorochemicals and hemoglobin. However, despite at least four decades of concerted effort and technology transfer between laboratories worldwide, many species still remain recalcitrant in culture. Nevertheless, isolated protoplasts are unique to a range of experimental procedures. In the context of plant genetic manipulation, somatic hybridisation by protoplast fusion enables nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes to be combined, fully or partially, at the interspecific and intergeneric levels to circumvent naturally occurring sexual incompatibility barriers. Uptake of isolated DNA into protoplasts provides the basis for transient and stable nuclear transformation, and also organelle transformation to generate transplastomic plants. Isolated protoplasts are also exploited in numerous miscellaneous studies involving membrane function, cell structure, synthesis of pharmaceutical products, and toxicological assessments.

Although there is structural and functional information available for humans and archaea PFDs, their existence and functions in malaria parasite remains uncharacterized. In the present review, we have collected the available information on prefoldin family members of archaea and humans and attempted to analyze unexplored PFD subunits of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Our review enhances the understanding of probable functions, structure and mechanism of substrate binding of Pf prefoldin by comparing with the available information of its homologs in archaea and H. sapiens. Three PfPFD out of six and a Pf prefoldin-like protein are reported to be essential for parasite survival that signifies their importance in malaria parasite biology. Transcriptome analyses suggest that PfPFD subunits are up-regulated at the mRNA level during asexual and sexual stages of parasite life cycle. Our in silico analysis suggested several pivotal proteins like myosin E, cytoskeletal protein (tubulin), merozoite surface protein and ring exported protein 3 as their interacting partners. Based on structural information of archaeal and H. sapiens PFDs, P. falciparum counterparts have been modelled and key interface residues were identified that are critical for oligomerization of PfPFD subunits.

The main aim of the study was to review the current data on PFASs in human breast milk, including the challenges of analysis as well as the possible modes of transfer from maternal blood. In this paper, previously published data on the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk from around the world were reviewed and summarised. Eligible studies with reference lists published before 1 June 2017 were included by searching several databases (including Scopus, ScienceOpen and SciFinder). From this search, studies with the number of participants in each study ranging from 2 to 1237 were identified. The review indicated that based on the structural profiles and concentration levels, there was variation in the geographical distribution of these compounds in breast milk. Although there are no recorded investigations on the modes of transfer from maternal blood to breast milk, literature suggests that the PFASs tend to be transferred through binding to various proteins. The review also examined the different sample preparation and analytical methods employed to measure the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk. This showed that solid phase extraction was the most common extraction method. After extraction, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was the most common analysis method. Since several of these methods were initially dedicated to monitoring PFASs in food and water, they demonstrate some limitations with regard to specificity and sensitivity to human fluids.

Metallocene complexes of group-III metals (scandocenes, yttrocenes, lanthanocenes), lanthanoids (neodymocenes) and group-IV metals (titanocenes, zirconocenes, hafnocenes) have been utilized in the selective (co-/hydro-)oligomerization of ethene, of the α-olefins propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene, of branched olefins, e.g. methyl-butenes, methyl-pentenes and styrene, of cycloolefins, e.g. cyclopentene and norbornene and of α, ω-dienes, e.g. 1,5-hexadiene and 1,7-octadiene. Group-III metallocenes are often active in the C-C coupling without a cocatalyst; group-IV metallocenes require the help of a cocatalyst, such as methylalumoxane, MAO, aluminum alkyls, e.g. AliBu 3, or perfluorated boranes, e.g. B(C6F5) 3. The actinoid metallocenes (C5M5) 2AnMe2 with An = thorium, uranium allow for the dimerization and oligomerization of terminal acetylenes. The dehydrooligomerization of (hydro)silanes is typically achieved by group-IV metallocene chlorides together with n-butyl lithium. Also included in this review are related sandwich and half-sandwich (mono-cyclopentadienyl) complexes used for olefin oligomerization. The related sandwich complexes feature phospholyl, boratabenzene or carboranate ligands. Methods of oligo-olefin analyses by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography (GC) or viscosity measurements for molecular weight determinations and by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for end group structure determinations are summarized. Possible applications of olefin oligomers, in particular oligopropenes are presented. The functionality of a double bond at the end of each chain (for further modifications) together with the product homogeneity are the advantages of oligomers from metallocene catalysis. In addition, olefin oligomerization is used to study mechanistic aspects and to obtain a better insight into the reaction mechanism of metallocene polymerization catalysis because of the homogeneity of the reaction mixture and because certain mechanistic aspects are easier to investigate in oligomeric products than in high-molar-mass polymers. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Research efforts tailored towards addressing these needs will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how environmental chemicals impact maternal and fetal health. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",breast cancer resistance protein; cadmium; carnitine transporter 2; chlorphenotane; dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; flame retardant; herbicide; hexabromocyclododecane; hexachlorocyclohexane; lipoprotein; methylmercury; multidrug resistance protein 1; noradrenalin transporter; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; pesticide; polybrominated diphenyl ether; tetrabromobisphenol A; unclassified drug; child health; exposome; feasibility study; fetal health; human; lipoprotein blood level; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; maternal welfare; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal care; quadrupole mass spectrometry; Review; sensitivity and specificity; syncytiotrophoblast; time of flight mass spectrometry; toxicity testing; animal; chemistry; female; fetomaternal transfusion; fetus blood; fetus development; maternal exposure; placenta; pollutant; pregnancy; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Exposome; Female; Fetal Blood; Fetal Development; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Maternal Health; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Placenta; Pregnancy

Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = −1.34 to −0.57), hip external rotation (−0.55;-1.07 to −0.03), hip extension (−0.72;-1.16 to −0.28), and knee extension (−0.97;-1.41 to −0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls. People with PFOA also presented with smaller volumes of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris when compared to asymptomatic controls. Also, people with PFOA presented with changes in muscle activation for the VL, VM and gluteus maximus (GMax) when compared to asymptomatic controls. Conclusion: People with PFOA present with lower strength and volume of the hip and quadriceps muscles and altered muscle activation of the VM, VL and GMax during ascending and descending stairs when compared to asymptomatic controls.

As the body of literature on their environmental effects has increased, so has regulatory and research scrutiny. The widespread usage of PFAS in industrial applications and consumer products, complicated by their environmental release, mobility, fate, and transport, have resulted in multiple exposure routes for humans. Furthermore, low screening levels and stringent regulatory standards that vary by state introduce considerable uncertainty and potential costs in the environmental management of PFAS. The recalcitrant nature of PFAS render their removal difficult, but existing and emerging technologies can be leveraged to destroy or sequester PFAS in a variety of environmental matrices. Additionally, new research on PFAS remediation technologies has emerged to address the efficiency, costs, and other shortcomings of existing remediation methods. Further research on the impact of field parameters such as secondary water quality effects, the presence of co-contaminants and emerging PFAS, reaction mechanisms, defluorination yields, and the decomposition products of treatment technologies is needed to fully evaluate these emerging technologies, and industry attention should focus on treatment train approaches to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

NA,The association between maternal perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,NA,NA,"Some studies have shown that maternal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may be associated with early attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to verify this association by reviewing existing studies and to provide a strong basis for preventing ADHD. The researchers searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Embase for all studies published before October 2020. Finally, we included nine articles for analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal exposure to PFASs was not significantly associated with the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.25; perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88–1.14; perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.80–1.09; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99–1.28; perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.15–2.32). Due to significant heterogeneity, we subsequently performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through subgroup analysis, we found that PFOS concentration of children’s blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD were statistically positively correlated, and there was also a positive correlation between PFOS exposure and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD in the America. Moreover, there was also a statistically positive correlation between PFNA concentration in maternal blood and the prevalence rate of early childhood ADHD. Sensitivity analysis showed that the final results did not change much, the sensitivity was low, and the results were relatively stable. In conclusion, a causal relationship between maternal PFASs exposure and ADHD in children was unlikely. Among them, PFOS, PFNA, and ADHD might have positive associations worthy of further investigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA

Despite the complex nature of the diseases, there is long-standing, and growing, evidence linking microbial infection to the development of AD dementia, which we summarize in this article. Also, we highlight emerging research findings that support a role for parainfection in the pathophysiology of AMD, a disease of the neurosensory retina that has been shown to share risk factors and pathological features with AD. Acute neurological infections, such as Bacterial Meningitis (BM), trigger inflammatory events that permanently change how the brain functions, leading to lasting cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation likewise is a known pathological event that occurs in the early stages of chronic age-related neurodegenerative diseases AD and AMD and might be triggered as a parainfectious event. To date, at least 16 microbial pathogens have been linked to the development of AD; on the other hand, investigation of a microbe-AMD relationship is in its infancy. This mini-review article provides a synthesis of existing evidence indicating a contribution of parainfection in the aetiology of AD and of emerging findings that support a similar process in AMD. Subsequently, it describes the major immunopathological mechanisms that are common to BM and AD/AMD. Together, this evidence leads to our proposal that both AD and AMD may have an infectious aetiology that operates through a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to deleterious outcomes. Last, it draws fresh insights from the existing literature about potential therapeutic options for BM that might alleviate neurological disruption associated with infections, and which could, by extension, be explored in the context of AD and AMD. © Copyright © 2021 Too, Hunt and Simunovic.",alternative complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E; C reactive protein; chemokine; complement; complement component C3; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; complement factor I; cytokine; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; membrane cofactor protein; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 2; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin inhibitor; age related macular degeneration; Alzheimer disease; bacterial meningitis; Candida albicans; central nervous system infection; Chlamydia pneumoniae; cryptococcal meningitis; cytokine storm; Cytomegalovirus; dementia; Epstein Barr virus; genetic linkage; genetic polymorphism; Helicobacter pylori; Hepatitis C virus; heredity; homeostasis; human; Human alphaherpesvirus 1; Human herpesvirus 6; Human immunodeficiency virus; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunosenescence; infection; lead poisoning; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Neisseria meningitidis; nervous system inflammation; oxidative stress; parainfection; Review; risk factor; systematic review; Toxoplasma gondii; traumatic brain injury; Varicella zoster virus

However, due to limited organocopper(III) compounds with well-defined structures, this elementary reaction still remains an extremely challenging issue. In this review, structurally well-defined organocopper(III) compounds are mainly divided into three classes based on their ligands: perfluoromethyl Cu(III) compounds, macrocyclic ligand-based aryl-Cu(III) compounds, and spiro organocopper(III) compounds chelated by bidentate ligands. The majority of organocopper(III) compounds display the typical square planar geometry. There also exist a few penta-coordinated organocopper(III) complexes, which share a weak apical Cu-L bond. In order to form a cis Cu(III)–C and Cu(III)–Nu bonding geometry required for reductive elimination, the re-arrangement of coordination modes around tetra-coordinated Cu(III) atoms is necessary. For the aryl-Cu(III) cationic complexes with one Cu(III)–C bond, the re-arrangement is triggered by the coordination of the fifth ligand (solvent or nucleophiles), while for the tetra-carbon-coordinated organocuprate(III) compounds, the process might be realized via the cleavage of one Cu(III)–C bond by attack of electrophiles. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions involving well-defined organocopper(III) compounds to form C—C or C–heteroatom bonds are discussed to support their intermediacy. © 2018 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

During pregnancy, the complement system must be appropriately regulated to allow for immunologic tolerance to the developing fetus and placenta. Although some degree of complement activation can be seen in normal pregnancy, the fetus seems to be protected in part through the placental expression of complement regulatory proteins, which inhibit complement activation at different steps along the complement activation cascade. In women who develop preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, there is a shift toward increased complement activation and decreased complement regulation. There is an increase in placental deposition of C5b-9, which is the terminal effector of classical, lectin, and alternative complement pathways. C5b-9 deposition stimulates trophoblasts to secrete soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, which sequesters vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor. Pathogenic mutations or deletions in complement regulatory genes, which predispose to increased complement activation, have been detected in women with preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. Before the disease, biomarkers of alternative complement pathway activation are increased; during active disease, biomarkers of terminal complement pathway activation are increased. Urinary excretion of C5b-9 is associated with preeclampsia with severe features and distinguishes it from other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Taken together, existing data link preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome with increased activation of the terminal complement pathway that, in some cases, may be influenced by genetic alterations in complement regulators. These findings suggest that the inhibition of the terminal complement pathway, possibly through C5 blockade, may be an effective strategy to treat preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, but this strategy warrants further evaluation in clinical trials. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","C reactive protein; CD59 antigen; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C4b; complement component C4d; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement membrane attack complex; decay accelerating factor; DNA; eculizumab; fibrin; ficolin; mannose binding lectin; membrane cofactor protein; messenger RNA; protein tyrosine kinase; soluble fms like tyrosine kinase 1; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 1; biological marker; complement; complement inhibitor; eculizumab; monoclonal antibody; placental growth factor; vasculotropin receptor 1; amniocentesis; antiangiogenic activity; apoptosis; blood vessel permeability; complement activation; complement alternative pathway; complement system; cytokine release; disease association; down regulation; enzyme inhibition; fetus death; gene deletion; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic screening; genetic variability; HELLP syndrome; heterozygosity; human; hypertension; MCP gene; nonhuman; oxygenation; pathophysiology; phenotype; placenta circulation; preeclampsia; pregnant woman; protein localization; proteinuria; Review; trophoblast; blood; female; genetics; HELLP syndrome; immunology; mutation; preeclampsia; pregnancy; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Biomarkers; Complement Activation; Complement Inactivating Agents; Complement System Proteins; Female; HELLP Syndrome; Humans; Mutation; Placenta Growth Factor; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1"

One example is the use of waste (e.g. sewage sludge, forest residues, agroindustry and food processing) to produce biogas. Comprised mostly of methane and carbon dioxide, it can be used as fuel in cogeneration systems, automotive mobility and domestic heating, among other applications. The increasing interest in the use of biogas has raised some questions regarding its quality for energy valorization. To start, the carbon dioxide content must be adjusted to upgrade the calorific power and economic value and then common potentially hazardous and even toxic impurities such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfur, halogens, or ammonia should be removed to ensure a correct operation. Recently, a close attention was drawn to the presence of siloxanes. These widespread emerging pollutants compromise the use of biogas for energy production due to the formation of abrasive silicon oxides after combustion that deposit on and damage several engine parts. In addition, some of them are potentially toxic and persistent, involving a threat to humans and the environment, which increased drastically the literature devoted to them in the last years.

On the other hand, the destructive technologies discussed here can effectively destroy PFAS compounds and fully address society’s urgent need to remediate this harmful family of chemical compounds. This review reports and compare widely accepted as well as emerging PFAS destruction technologies. Some of the technologies presented in this review are still under development at the lab scale, while others have already been tested in the field. © 2022 by the authors.","environmental chemical; per and polyfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; chemical compound; health impact; private sector; public sector; technological development; degradation; destruction; destruction technology; electrochemical oxidation; electrochemistry; incineration; ion exchange; oxidation; photocatalysis; plasma; Review; separation technique; sonolysis; supercritical water oxidation; technology; thermal degradation; human; water pollutant; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Therefore, temporary perfluorocarbon and permanent silicone oil tamponade are used. A predictor of poor visual outcome is the presence of retinal and choroidal injury. In our patients, the most important prognostic factor was the initial visual acuity after the injury. Vitrectomy can significantly reduce the incidence of enucleation.

Authors provide a condensed knowledge and research results in the area of caregiving consequences, especially both subjective and objective caregivers' burden. The consequences of care apply to carers' social and leisure activities, financial status, health condition. The burden of care has three fundamental causes: the reorganisation of mental health services, a social isolation of patients and their families and the lack of systemic support for caregivers. The problem of caregiving consequences has been investigated in several studies. In order to identify factors, which have impact on caregiver distress, a variety instruments have been developed. This paper focuses on questionnaires useful for the systematic assessment of both objective and subjective burden: Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ), Perceived Family Burden Scale (PFBS), Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS), Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI), Family Problems Questionnaire (FPQ).

NA,The epidemiologic evidence linking prenatal and postnatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals with male reproductive disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field. © The Author 2016.",NA

This procedure may also prove life-saving in the hypoplastic left heart syndrome, with the addition of atrial septal defect creation when left atrial decompression is indicated. This syndrome was the commonest cause of death from congenital heart disease in the first month of life in our recent experience (31 percent), based on a consecutive autopsy series of 174 neonates with congenital heart disease. The anatomic findings in 10 autopsy cases of interrupted aortic arch are summarized. A new understanding of the morphogenesis of these anomalies is presented, based on correlation of embryologic and pathologic data.

Hypoxic zones targeted as cells within them may be radiation resistant, poorly perfused by chemotherapeutic agents, and possibly drug resistant due to hypoxia-related gene amplification. Nitroimidazoles have gained particular attention as chemical modifiers because they can increase the radiation sensitivity of hypoxic cells, are cytotoxic to hypoxic cells, can increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and are useful for imaging hypoxic cells. While both radiosensitization and chemosensitization require hypoxia, the mechanism of the enhancement of each of the modalities is different. The 2-nitroimidazole hypoxic sensitizers SR 2508 and Ro-03-8799, which are less toxic than the prototype misonidazole (Miso), are in clinical trials, and dual function molecules that include a hypoxic sensitizer and alkylating function are being developed. The presence of both acutely and chronically hypoxic cells in animal tumors has been demonstrated by new imaging techniques. Oxygen delivery to tumors is being altered by the use of perfluorocarbons, and agents that alter hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. Compounds that are selectively toxic to hypoxic cells are being developed. Nonhypoxic modifiers are also being investigated. Thiol modification, particularly the alteration of glutathione concentration, has complex effects on the cell's biochemistry, in addition to affecting the competition between oxygen and thiol groups for the restoration and fixation of radiation-induced radicals. WR-2721 is being studied as a means of reducing the normal tissue toxicity of radiation and chemotherapy. Increased thiol concentration may be a mechanism of cross-resistance between certain chemotherapeutic agents and radiation.",amifostine; etanidazole; misonidazole; pimonidazole; cancer therapy; drug sensitization; human; hypoxia; priority journal; radiosensitization; review

The aim of this review is to summarize several studies in Japan and characterize the toxicities of these compounds. We also compared the levels of contamination with those reported from various countries to illustrate the unique situation of the toxicological issues within Japan. PFOA and PFOS concentrations in surface water in Japan are in the ranges of 0.1-67,000 ng/L and 0.1-526 ng/L, respectively. While the origin of PFOS in surface water remains unknown, PFOA present in surface water is very likely to have been released from a few industries. The levels of PFOA and PFOS in the atmosphere are 71.8-919 pg/m3 and 2.3-21.8 pg/m3, respectively. The concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in Japanese serum range from an undetectable level to 52.2 ng/ml and from 0.2 to 57.7 ng/ml, respectively. The levels of PFOA and PFOS present in the serum of the inhabitants of Kyoto are higher than those of other cities. One epidemiological study conducted by 3M revealed an increase in prostate cancer mortality [3.3-fold increase (95% CI, 1.02-10.6)] among workers exposed to PFOA. Another study conducted by 3M revealed an increase in bladder cancer mortality (SMR 12.77, 95% CI 2.63-37.35) among workers exposed to PFOS. PFOA and PFOS had a low order of toxicity in an acute toxicity study in rodents; however, they exhibited versatile toxicities in primates. Both chemicals are carcinogenic in rodents, causing reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Additionally, peroxisome proliferation and calcium channel modulation are demonstrated effects.

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg PFOS daily by gavage from gestation day (GD) 2 to GD 21; pregnant CD-1 mice were treated with 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg PFOS from GD 1 to GD 18. Controls received 0.5% Tween-20 vehicle (1 ml/kg for rats and 10 ml/kg for mice). At parturition, newborns were observed for clinical signs and survival. All animals were born alive and initially appeared to be active. In the highest dosage groups (10 mg/kg for rat and 20 mg/kg for mouse), the neonates became pale, inactive, and moribund within 30-60 min, and all died soon afterward. In the 5 mg/kg (rat) and 15 mg/kg (mouse) dosage groups, the neonates also became moribund but survived for a longer period of time (8-12 h). Over 95% of these animals died within 24 h. Approximately 50% of offspring died at 3 mg/kg for rat and 10 mg/kg for mouse. Cross-fostering the PFOS-exposed rat neonates (5 mg/kg) to control nursing dams failed to improve survival. Serum concentrations of PFOS in newborn rats mirrored the maternal administered dosage and were similar to those in the maternal circulation at GD 21; PFOS levels in the surviving neonates declined in the ensuing days. Small but significant and persistent growth lags were detected in surviving rat and mouse pups exposed to PFOS prenatally, and slight delays in eye opening were noted. Significant increases in liver weight were observed in the PFOS-exposed mouse pups. Serum thyroxine levels were suppressed in the PFOS-treated rat pups, although triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] levels were not altered. Choline acetyltransferase activity (an enzyme that is sensitive to thyroid status) in the prefrontal cortex of rat pups exposed to PFOS prenatally was slightly reduced, but activity in the hippocampus was not affected. Development of learning, determined by T-maze delayed alternation in weanling rats, was not affected by PFOS exposure. These results indicate that in utero exposure to PFOS severely compromised postnatal survival of neonatal rats and mice, and caused delays in growth and development that were accompanied by hypothyroxinemia in the surviving rat pups.","choline acetyltransferase; liothyronine; perfluorooctane; sulfonic acid derivative; thyrotropin; thyroxine; animal experiment; animal tissue; clinical feature; concentration (parameters); controlled study; developmental disorder; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; eye; female; gestational age; growth inhibition; learning; liothyronine blood level; liver weight; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; perinatal period; prefrontal cortex; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; rat; review; survival rate; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; Administration, Oral; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Body Weight; Choline O-Acetyltransferase; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fluorocarbons; Liver; Longevity; Maternal Exposure; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Organ Size; Prefrontal Cortex; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Teratogens; Thyroxine; Animalia; Rodentia"

Consequently, the synthesis of such compounds encompasses a large body of scientific articles and patents developed in the previous century. Most recent reviews on this subject have thus focused on summarizing this traditional literature, and have thereby spurred the development of a new wave of reaction manifolds employing modern synthesis principles. This new generation of methodologies focuses on the greener synthesis of perfluoroalkylated aromatic scaffolds, through the use of more efficient organometallic reactions, as well as by photochemical and electrochemical strategies.

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aδSPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aδSPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed.

Because of their persistence and their potential to accumulate they are of toxicological concern. The present review presents the current knowledge of PFC monitoring data in environmental media relevant for human exposure. In this context, PFC concentrations in indoor and ambient air, house dust, drinking water and food are outlined. Furthermore, we summarize human biomonitoring data of PFC levels in blood, breast milk, and human tissues. An estimate of the overall exposure of the general adult population is provided and compared with tolerable intake values. Using a simplified model, the average (and upper) level of daily exposure including all potential routes amounts to 1.6 ng/kgbody weight (8.8 ng/kgbody weight) for PFOS and 2.9 ng/kgbody weight (12.6 ng/kgbody weight) for PFOA in adults in the general population. The majority of exposure can be attributed to the oral route, mainly to diet. Overall, the contribution of PFOS and PFOA precursors to total exposure seems to be limited. Besides this background exposure of the general population, a specific additional exposure may occur which causes an increased PFC body burden. This has been observed in populations living near PFC production facilities or in areas with environmental contamination of PFCs. The consumption of highly contaminated fish products may also cause an increase in PFC body burdens. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Although experimental models of hepatic I/R injury represent a compromise between the clinical reality and experimental simplification, the clinical transfer of experimental results is problematic because of anatomical and physiological differences and the inevitable simplification of experimental work. In this review, the strengths and limitations of the various models of hepatic I/R are discussed. Several strategies to protect the liver from I/R injury have been developed in animal models and, some of these, might find their way into clinical practice. We also attempt to highlight the fact that the mechanisms responsible for hepatic I/R injury depend on the experimental model used, and therefore the therapeutic strategies also differ according to the model used. Thus, the choice of model must therefore be adapted to the clinical question being answered. Copyright © 2012 M.

NA,Association between perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and thyroid function in adults: A meta-analysis,2018,NA,NA,"Objective Many people are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) because these substances are widely used as industrial products. Although epidemiological studies suggest that PFASs can disrupt thyroid hormones, the association between PFAS exposure and thyroid function remains inconclusive. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and thyroid hormones. Methods We searched medical literature databases for articles on the association between PFASs–perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)–and thyroid hormone levels in adults. Twelve articles were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled z values were calculated with correlation or regression coefficients. Results The blood PFOS concentration was positively correlated with free T4. The pooled z value was 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.08). PFOS was negatively correlated with total T4 and total T3 when excluding outlier studies. In a subgroup analysis stratified by mean PFOS concentration, PFOS was observed to be positively associated with free T4 and TSH and negatively associated with total T3 in the intermediate concentration group (8–16 ng/mL). PFOA concentration was negatively correlated with total T4 (z value, -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03) after omitting one outlier study. PFHxS also showed a negative correlation with total T4 (z value, -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01). A subgroup analysis of pregnant women showed that there was no association between PFASs and thyroid hormones. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that PFASs are negatively associated with total T4, and their effect can be different depending on the PFAS concentration. © 2018 Kim et al.

From the environmental, ecological, and healthy points of view, it is urgent to understand their environmental risks of these HFPEs. This article aimed at introducing these HFPEs in physiochemical properties and potential uses, and evaluating their environmental risks (i.e., global warming, photochemical potential, and environmental partition). Further, the updated data on their toxicological profiles and potential exposure hazards from their degradation products were also addressed in this paper. It is indicated that HFPEs still pose some significant hazards, especially global warming and photochemical potentials, to the atmosphere. Regarding the estimation of partition properties (i.e., vapor pressure, octanol-water partition coefficient and bioconcentration) of HFPEs, the predicted values of log Kow for several HFPEs were found to be below zero, suggesting that they should possess very low potential for bioaccumulation in the environment. © 2006.","Environmental impact; Global warming; Oligomers; Solvents; Environmental risks; Exposure hazard; Hydrofluoropolyethers (HFPE); Photochemical potential; Ethers; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; hydrofluoropolyether; octanol; polyether derivative; water; Environmental impact; Ethers; Global warming; Oligomers; Solvents; bioaccumulation; environmental risk; global warming; greenhouse gas; hydrofluorocarbon; risk assessment; toxicity; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; chemical structure; environmental exposure; environmental impact; fire protection; fluorination; greenhouse effect; heat exchange; ozone layer; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; pollution; review; risk assessment; statistical significance; vapor pressure; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Ethers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Risk Assessment"

Although most of the filaments assemble on their own to form higher order structures, growing evidence suggests that there are a number of prokaryotic proteins that polymerise only in the presence of a matrix such as DNA, lipid membrane or even another filament. Matrix-assisted filament systems are frequently nucleotide dependent and cytomotive but rarely considered as part of the bacterial cytoskeleton. Here, we categorise this family of filament-forming systems as collaborative filaments and introduce a simple nomenclature. Collaborative filaments are frequent in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are involved in vital cellular processes including chromosome segregation, DNA repair and maintenance, gene silencing and cytokinesis to mention a few. In this review, we highlight common principles underlying collaborative filaments and correlate these with known functions. Bacterial protein filaments can assemble on their own as part of the cytoskeleton, or alternatively may require an scaffolding matrix. The latter, now called collaborative filaments, are conserved and are known to be involved in critical cellular functions, such as cell division. © 2015 The Authors.","collaborative protein filament; cytoskeleton protein; Dan filament; DivIVA protein; DNA; dynamin; FtsA protein; FtsZ protein; MinCD protein; RecA protein; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; cytoskeleton protein; cell division; cell wall; chromosome segregation; cytokinesis; cytoskeleton; DNA repair; eukaryote; gene silencing; lipid membrane; nomenclature; nonhuman; priority journal; prokaryote; protein family; protein function; Review; bacterium; genetics; human; metabolism; physiology; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Division; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Cytoskeleton; DNA Repair; DNA, Bacterial; Gene Silencing; Humans"

Drugs and toxic agents are in vivo metabolized in such a way that more polar compounds are usually formed. Derivatization of these metabolites is often an unavoidable requirement for gas chromatographic analysis. Application of derivatization methods in recent years has been relevant, especially for silylation, acylation, alkylation and the formation of cyclic or diastereomeric derivatives. Given the relevance of drug of abuse testing in modern toxicology, main derivatization procedures for opiates, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and LSD have been reviewed. Papers describing the analyses of drugs of abuse in matrixes other than blood, such as hair or sweat, have received especial attention. Advances in derivatization for sports drug testing have been particularly relevant for anabolic steroids, diuretics and corticosteroids. Among the several methodologies applied, the formation of trimethylsilyl, perfluoroacyl or methylated derivatives have probed to be both versatile and extensively used. Further advances in derivatization for GC-MS applications in clinical and forensic toxicology will depend on the one hand on the degree of further use of GC-MS for routine applications and, on the other hand, on the alternative progress made for developments in LC-MS or CE-MS. Last but not least, the appearance of comprehensive libraries in which reference spectra for different derivatives of many drugs and their metabolites are collected will have an important impact on the expansion of derivatization in GC-MS for toxicological applications.",amphetamine derivative; anabolic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; cannabis; cocaine; corticosteroid; diuretic agent; lysergide; opiate derivative; xenobiotic agent; acylation; alkylation; chirality; cyclization; derivatization; doping; drug abuse; gas chromatography; human; mass spectrometry; priority journal; review; toxicology

Owing to anthropogenic sources and booming industrial practices, the most challenging issue is increased water pollution and environmental insecurity. For instance, several types of synthetic dyes are toxic up to a certain extent, as emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) pose adverse environmental and potential health consequences. A gradual increase in the contamination sources and unpredictable environmental changes in terms of anthropogenic pollution severely affect both water availability and distribution. Therefore, the treatment of dyes containing wastewater matrices for water resource generation is one of the most important tasks, which must be addressed effectively. With structural tunability, MOFs have been appearing as a robust tool for remediating toxic pollutants from wastewater matrices. Moreover, the promising functionality, structural tunability, robust catalytic attributes, compatibility, large surface area, stability in water, and ease in surface functionalization make MOFs one of the considerable materials of interest. This review work spotlights the present-day progress related to MOFs and their catalytic and adsorptive chemistry for a sustainable environment. Following a brief introduction, the characteristic rendering MOFs, as adsorbents, are given with prominent examples. Next, several synthesis routes as a roadmap to engineer MOFs are discussed. From the applied perspective, the adsorptive and catalytic potentialities of MOFs as given by addressing sustainable mitigation of toxic dyes. The last section of the work illustrates key challenging issues and future directions by considering the suiting importance of MOFs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Catalysis; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Remediation; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water resources; Anthropogenic pollution; Anthropogenic sources; Contamination sources; Emerging organic contaminants; Environmental change; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Surface Functionalization; Sustainable environment; Sustainable development; dye; metal organic framework; water; anthropogenic source; catalysis; organic pollutant; organometallic compound; pollutant removal; sustainability; wastewater treatment; catalysis; contamination; ecosystem restoration; human; photocatalysis; pollutant; Review; surface property; waste component removal; waste water management; water availability; water supply; adsorption; catalysis; wastewater; Adsorption; Catalysis; Environmental Pollutants; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Waste Water

Methylation is the most frequent post-transcriptional tRNA modification that can occur on almost all nitrogen sites of the nucleobases, on the C5 atom of pyrimidines, on the C2 and C8 atoms of adenosine and, additionally, on the oxygen of the ribose 2′-OH. The methylation on the N1 atom of adenosine to form 1-methyladenosine (m1A) has been identified at nucleotide position 9, 14, 22, 57, and 58 in different tRNAs. In some cases, these modifications have been shown to increase tRNA structural stability and induce correct tRNA folding. This review provides an overview of the currently known m1A modifications, the different m1A modification sites, the biological role of each modification, and the enzyme responsible for each methylation in different species. The review further describes, in detail, two enzyme families responsible for formation of m1A at nucleotide position 9 and 58 in tRNA with a focus on the tRNA binding, m1A mechanism, protein domain organisation and overall structures. © 2017 by the authors.","1 methyladenosine; DNA adenine methyltransferase; m1a58; m1a9; m1g9; methyltransferase; RNA binding protein; RNA recognition motif protein; s adenosylmethionine; small interfering RNA; tetramer; transfer RNA; unclassified drug; 1-methyladenosine; adenosine; enzyme; transfer RNA; Aquifex aeolicus; archaeon; bacterium; Haemophilus influenzae; human; Methanocaldococcus jannaschii; methylation; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; protein modification; protein stability; proton transport; Review; RNA processing; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Sulfolobus acidocaldarius; Thermotoga maritima; Thermus thermophilus; analogs and derivatives; animal; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; molecular model; Adenosine; Animals; Enzymes; Humans; Methylation; Models, Molecular; RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA, Transfer"

The World Health Organization has listed estrogens as group 1 carcinogens. These contaminants are of substantial concern because of potential threats to human health, and aquatic organisms on long-term exposure. A range of methods, including oxidation, adsorption, electrochemical, and irradiation techniques have been employed for their remediation from aqueous systems. However, inadequate removal, toxic sludge generation, high operating costs, and the requisite for skilled operating and maintenance personnel commercially hampered the application of many methods. An interesting alternative treatment approach based on the use of oxidoreductases, particularly laccases, has recently gained amicability for the biotransformation of emerging pollutants. The use of immobilized enzymes is more cost-effective from an industrial perspective due to improved catalytic stability, reusability, reduction of product inhibition, and easier product separation. This review provides comprehensive knowledge on the use of laccases in the biodegradation of steroidal estrogens, including estrone, 17β-estradiol, and 17α-ethinylestradiol with endocrine-disrupting potency from the environment. After an overview of estrogens and catalytic properties of laccase, the use of free, as well as immobilized laccases with a particular emphasis on estrogens removal by laccase-based fed-batch, packed bed bioreactors, and membrane reactors, is discussed. A comparison of existing treatment technologies with enzyme technology for the removal of estrogens from different environmental matrices is made. Lastly, along with concluding remarks, future research direction aimed at bridging knowledge gaps for estrogenic compounds removal are also proposed in this very important research area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic organisms; Batch reactors; Biodegradation; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Enzyme inhibition; Health risks; Operating costs; Packed beds; Reusability; Endocrine disrupting activity; Environmental matrixes; Enzymatic membrane reactors; Fed-batch bioreactors; Future research directions; Laccases; Steroidal estrogens; World Health Organization; Water pollution; estradiol; estrogen; estrone; ethinylestradiol; laccase; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; immobilized enzyme; laccase; biodegradation; bioreactor; endocrine disruptor; environmental impact; enzyme activity; estrogenic compound; membrane; persistence; steroid; water treatment; biodegradation; catalysis; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; enzyme activity; immobilization; ozonation; priority journal; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; bioremediation; biotransformation; metabolism; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Endocrine Disruptors; Enzymes, Immobilized; Estrogens; Laccase; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the “PRISMA” statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role.

Commercial applications include their use as phthalocyanine dyes in optical discs, porphyrins in photodynamic therapy, and as oxygen sensors. Most applications of these dyes require exocyclic moieties to improve solubility, target diseases, modulate photophysical properties, or direct the self-organization into architectures with desired photonic properties. The synthesis of the porphyrinoid depends on the desired application, but the de novo synthesis often involves several steps, is time consuming, and results in low isolated yields. Thus, the application of core porphyrinoid platforms that can be rapidly and efficiently modified to evaluate new molecular architectures allows researchers to focus on the design concepts rather than the synthesis methods, and opens porphyrinoid chemistry to a broader scientific community. We have focused on several widely available, commercially viable porphyrinoids as platforms: meso-perfluorophenylporphyrin, perfluorophthalocyanine, and meso-perfluorophenylcorrole. The perfluorophenylporphyrin is readily converted to the chlorin, bacteriochlorin, and isobacteriochlorin. Derivatives of all six of these core platforms can be efficiently and controllably made via mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions using primary S, N, and O nucleophiles bearing a wide variety of functional groups. The remaining fluoro groups enhance the photo and oxidative stability of the dyes and can serve as spectroscopic signatures to characterize the compounds or in imaging applications using 19F NMR.

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based &amp; no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon; Fish; Liquids; Meats; Moderators; Oils and fats; Tissue; Water; Cooking time; Data synthesis; Human exposures; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; POP; Substance concentrations; Cooking; carbon; chemical compound; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; water; alkanesulfonic acid; carbon; fluorocarbon; concentration (composition); food quality; literature review; meta-analysis; organofluorine; persistent organic pollutant; seafood; concentration (parameter); cooking; data synthesis; effect size; food analysis; food contamination; food intake; freshwater fish; human; nonhuman; practice guideline; raw food; Review; sea food; systematic review; temperature sensitivity; animal; cooking; fish; meta analysis; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Carbon; Cooking; Fishes; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Seafood

Lubricant not only minimizes the friction and wear but also dissipates the heat generated due to friction and removes debris from the area of contact. Environmental concerns, decreasing mineral oil reserves and difficult disposal of nonbiodegradable conventional lubricants have urged the researchers to shift towards environmental-friendly lubricants. Number of tribological studies carried out in the past have proved that ionic liquid-based bio-lubricants are sustainable and biodegradable alternative to mineral oils. This paper presents a brief review of properties of ionic liquids and their ability to reduce friction and wear between the interacting surfaces. Tribological performance and compatibility of ionic liquids with various base-oils have been compared under boundary lubrication.

One issue associated with WWTP operation is the potential for groundwater contamination via leaking or infiltration of wastewater, particularly with inorganic nutrients (ammonia and nitrate) as well as persistent organic compounds. Despite the potential for such contamination to create environmental and health risks, conventional methods, such as the assessment of major ions, nutrients, bacteriological indicators and conventional tracers (such as stable and radiogenic isotopes) are often unable to provide accurate delineation of multiple potential sources of contamination. This is particularly important for WWTPs which often occur in urban, peri-urban or intensively farmed agricultural areas where multiple potential sources (such as livestock, fertilisers, wastewater irrigation, and domestic septic systems) may contribute similar contaminants. This review explores the applicability of promising novel groundwater tracers, such as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and isotopic tracers, which can be used in conjunction with conventional tracers (i.e. ‘co-tracers’) to provide a more definitive assessment of contaminant sources, plume delineation and even (potentially) indicating the age of contamination (e.g., recent vs. legacy). The suitability of the novel groundwater tracers is evaluated according to four key criteria: (i). sufficient presence in raw wastewater and/or treated effluents; (ii) diagnostic of WWTP impacts as opposed to other potential off-site contamination sources; (iii) persistence in the subsurface environment; and (iv) amenable to rapid and sensitive analysis. Further analysis of various classes of CECs along with improved detection limits associated with improvements in analytical methodologies should allow for future application of promising groundwater tracers, providing WWTP operators and regulatory authorities a more definitive toolbox with which to assess groundwater contamination associated with site operations.

Data are presented on ISEs with membranes based on perfluorocompounds, which are especially important for the medical and biological applications. Studies are briefly described where instead of the replacement of PVC with self-plasticized polymers, the low-molecular plasticizers are replaced with polymeric analogs, retaining PVC as the polymeric matrix. Use of ionic liquids as the ISE membrane components is discussed, together with the interpretation of the literature data on the regularities in the functioning of such electrodes. Issues, studied mostly from the material science view are discussed throughout the review in their relation to electrochemistry. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Electrodes; Ion selective membranes; Ionic liquids; Ionophores; Ions; Matrix algebra; Membranes; Plasticizers; Polymer membrane electrodes; Polymers; Polyvinyl chlorides; Reinforced plastics; Solvents; Biological applications; Fluorous; Membrane components; Perfluorocompounds; Plasticized polymers; Polymer backbones; Polymeric matrices; Polymeric plasticizers; Ion selective electrodes

Studies have shown that H2O2 production is significantly increased in the non-inflamed colonic epithelium of individuals with UC. H2O2 is a powerful neutrophilic chemo-tactic agent that can diffuse through colonic epithelial cell membranes creating an interstitial chemotactic molecular “trail” that attracts adjacent intra-vascular neutrophils into the colonic epithelium leading to mucosal inflammation and UC. A novel therapy aimed at removing the inappropriate H2O2 mediated chemotactic signal has been highly effective in achieving complete histologic resolution of colitis in patients experiencing refractory disease with at least one (biopsy-proven) histologic remission lasting 14 years to date. The evidence implies that therapeutic intervention to prevent the re-establishment of a pathologic H2O2 mediated chemotactic signaling gradient will indefinitely preclude neutrophilic migration into the colonic epithelium constituting a functional cure for this disease. Cumulative data indicate that individuals with UC have normal immune systems and current treatment guidelines calling for the suppression of the immune response based on the belief that UC is caused by an underlying immune dysfunction are not supported by the evidence and may cause serious adverse effects. It is the aim of this paper to present experimental and clinical evidence that identifies H2O2 produced by the colonic epithelium as the causal agent in the pathogenesis of UC. A detailed explanation of a novel therapeutic intervention to normalize colonic H2O2, its rationale, components, and formulation is also provided. ©The Author(s) 2022.

The hydrogen bonding interaction is weak. The arrangement based on this mechanism is attained rapidly, but is slowly replaced (if partially) by a bona fide chemical bond. The issue of the exact nature of this chemical bond has been left unanswered in most of the reports. Past works deemed to have explored and elucidated the identity of the bond in question are gathered, reviewed and deductively presented. The review, we believe, clearly shows that the bonding in question involves (1) dangling bonds shielded within the sputter-deposited carbon, (2) transfer of the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl unit of Z-dol to the dangling bond site, and (3) attachment of the remaining alkoxy system, Z-O-CF 2-CH 2-O•, to the carbon surface as a pendant ether unit. The Z-dol moiety thus attached is held by a bona fide chemical bond, and cannot be replaced by water molecules nor removed by solvent extraction. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.",Magnetic hard disks; Molecular dispositions; Perfluoropolyethers; Carbon; Dangling bonds; Disks (machine components); Hydrogen bonds; Polyethers; Bond strength (chemical); Bond strength (chemical); Carbon; Dangling bonds; Disks (machine components); Hydrogen bonds; Polyethers

Concurrently, composites of hydrocarbon polymers, such as poly(arylene ether ketone)s, poly(benzimidazole)s, poly(arylene sulfone)s, poly(vinyl alcohol) etc., have been developed as alternatives to perflurinated membranes.

Furthermore, the application of clays, perfluorinated resinsulfonic acids, and supported (fluoro) sulfonic acids is the subject of intensive studies in this area. This review deals with the developments, mainly during the past decade, in the use of heterogeneous catalysts for Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic compounds. The argument is organized in five sections, namely acylation of arenes, aromatic ethers, aromatic trioethers, phenolic substrates, and heterocycles. Focus is on the role played by the surface active sites in the activation of reagents as well as in the different modes of regioselectivity encountered in the acylation of arenes, aromatic ethers, and phenols.","Acylation; Aromatic compounds; Catalysts; Organic acids; Surface active agents; Friedel-Crafts acylation; Heterogeneous catalysts; Solid catalysts; Friedel-Crafts reaction; aldehyde; aluminum silicate; aromatic hydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; ketone; metal; oxide; perfluorosulfonic acid; zeolite; acylation; catalysis; chemical structure; chemistry; clay; review; synthesis; Acylation; Aldehydes; Aluminum Silicates; Catalysis; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Ketones; Metals; Molecular Structure; Oxides; Zeolites"

Although effective water treatment technologies exist for physical removal of many PFAS from water (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin), a PFAS-concentrated waste stream is generated as an end product that can potentially reintroduce PFAS back into the environment. Thus, there is an increased interest in developing destructive technologies to decompose and mineralize PFAS directly in water or in these waste streams. High energy electron beam (e-beam) accelerators have been used for water treatment to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant contaminants, including PFAS, since the 1960s. However, large-scale applications of e-beam for water treatment are restricted due to its high energy consumption and inability to treat large flow rates. Considering there are very few available technologies for destructive removal of PFAS, this study provides a critical review on the treatment of PFAS by direct irradiation of contaminated water by e-beam from an energy consumption point of view. To date, very limited studies have been conducted to investigate the success of this technology to treat PFAS. Results from the limited studies were not directly comparable due to the variation in operating conditions and water quality parameters used in the studies. Here, for the first time, we develop and apply the concept of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to assess the performance of e-beam for PFAS treatment. Results show that EE/O is a better performance parameter than the G value of e-beam for interstudy comparisons and to evaluate the effects of water quality and operating parameters on e-beam performance. We additionally developed a kinetic scheme to predict the performance of e-beam to treat PFAS and revealed that the competition between species to react with aqueous electrons is the determinant factor influencing PFAS degradation efficiency. Comparison of EE/O values of e-beam (range: 31−176 kWh m−3 order −1) with other destructive technologies (range: 5−9595 kWh m−3 order −1) suggest that e-beam, for PFAS treatment, is a promising approach under favorable conditions. This review further elucidates the feasibility and limitations of e-beam technology that could be improved upon to potentially make e-beam viable for large-scale water treatment applications. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",NA

Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are routinely detected in landfill leachate, with short chain (C4-C7) PFAAs being most abundant, possibly indicating their greater mobility, and reflecting the industrial shift towards shorter-chain compounds. Despite its restricted use, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) remains one of the most abundant PFAAs in landfill leachates. Recent studies have also documented the presence of PFAA-precursors (e.g., saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids) in landfill leachates at concentrations comparable to, or higher than, the most frequently detected PFAAs. Landfill ambient air also contains elevated concentrations of PFASs, primarily semi-volatile precursors (e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols) compared to upwind control sites, suggesting that landfills are potential sources of atmospheric PFASs. The fate of PFASs inside landfills is controlled by a combination of biological and abiotic processes, with biodegradation releasing most of the PFASs from landfilled waste to leachate. Biodegradation in simulated anaerobic reactors has been found to be closely related to the methanogenic phase. The methane-yielding stage also results in higher pH (>7) of leachates, correlated with higher mobility of PFAAs. Little information exists regarding PFAA-precursors in landfills. To avoid significant underestimation of the total PFAS released from landfills, PFAA-precursors and their degradation products should be determined in future studies. Owing to the semi-volatile nature of some precursor compounds and their degradation products, future studies also need to include landfill gas to clarify degradation pathways and the overall fate of PFASs. Landfill leachate and potentially landfill gas act as secondary environmental sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradation; Biogas; Chains; Degradation; Leachate treatment; Elevated concentrations; Fluorotelomer carboxylic acids; Future research directions; Leachates; Perfluoroalkyl; Polyfluoroalkyl; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Shorter chain compounds; Land fill; alkyl group; carboxylic acid; methane; organophosphate; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanoic acid; biodegradation; chemical compound; concentration (composition); element mobility; environmental fate; future prospect; landfill; leachate; methanogenesis; ambient air; atmosphere; biodegradation; biological activity; climate; concentration (parameters); gas waste; industrialization; landfill; landfill leachate; methanogenesis; pH; precursor; Review; bioremediation; chemistry; waste disposal facility; water pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Caprylates; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Waste Disposal Facilities; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The relationship between the structure formation and photophysics is known at the quantitative level. The factors which we understand control these relationships include virtually all important materials parameters such as solvent quality, side chain branching, side chain length, molecular weight, thermal history and myriad functionalizations. This review describes advances in controlling structure and photophysical properties in polyfluorene solutions and gels. It discusses the demarcation lines between solutions, gels, and macrophase separation in conjugated polymers and reviews essential solid state properties needed for understanding of solutions. It gives an insight into polyfluorene and polyfluorene beta phase in solutions and gels and describes all the structural levels in solvent matrices, ranging from intramolecular structures to the diverse aggregate classes and network structures and agglomerates of these units. It goes on to describe the kinetics and thermodynamics of these structures. It details the manifold molecular parameters used in their control and continues with the molecular confinement and touches on permanently cross-linked networks. Particular focus is placed on the experimental results of archetypical polyfluorenes and solvent matrices and connection between structure and photonics. A connection is also made to the mean field type theories of hairy-rod like polymers. This altogether allows generalizations and provides a guideline for materials scientists, synthetic chemists and device engineers as well, for this important class of semiconductor, luminescent polymers. The structural hierarchies of polyfluorenes in solution and gel range from intramolecular structures to the diverse aggregate classes, network structures and agglomerates of these units including the curious beta phase. These structures can be controlled by solvent quality, side chain branching, side chain length, molecular weight, thermal history and myriad functionalisations. These different structures have profound effects on the photophysics of the polymers at the quantitative level. Here, these properties of polyfluorenes are reviewed in detail.

There are many criteria for replacement membranes but the main criteria such as stability, cost, and environmental friendliness are the most important properties. When these criteria are met, one property that must be guaranteed in MD is the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface. Therefore, many studies have modified the surface of less hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes into super-hydrophobic membranes. However, the use of agents derived from fluoroalkyl silane, although providing high performance, is expensive and not environmentally friendly. This study mainly reviews hydrophobic membrane surface modifications using non-fluoroalkyl agents applied in MD processes.

The adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a family of proteins involved in cell death pathways that perform distinctly opposite functions to regulate cell fate decisions. On the one hand, ANT catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate export from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space with the concomitant import of ADP from the intermembrane space to the matrix. On the other hand, during periods of stress, ANT could function as a lethal pore and trigger the process of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, which leads irreversibly to cell death. In human, ANT is encoded by four homologous genes, whose expression is not only tissue specific, but also varies according to the pathophysiological state of the cell. Recent evidence revealed a differential role of the ANT isoforms in apoptosis and a deregulation of their expression in cancer. In this review, we introduce the current knowledge of ANT in apoptosis and cancer cells and propose a novel classification of ANT isoforms. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","adenine nucleotide translocase; adenosine diphosphate; arsenic trioxide; atractyloside; bongkrekic acid; carboxyatractyloside; diamide; isoprotein; lonidamine; nelfinavir; nitric oxide; perfluorooctane; protein Bax; quercetin; retinoic acid; sulfonamide; verteporfin; apoptosis; cancer cell; cancer growth; cell compartmentalization; cell fate; cell metabolism; cell transport; drug binding; enzyme activity; enzyme synthesis; gene control; gene expression; gene repression; human; mitochondrion; neoplasm; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Animals; Apoptosis; Humans; Isoenzymes; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases; Neoplasms; Mammalia"

Recent Findings: Of 37 eligible epidemiological studies among vulnerable populations published between January 2018 and April 2019 in which over half were prospective, the most investigated populations were pregnant women and children. Racial/ethnic minorities, individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES), and those occupationally exposed were studied the least. The most studied persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and the most studied non-POPs were phenols. Across chemical classes, studies found certain POPs (e.g., PFAS) and non-POPs (i.e., phenols, phthalates, and parabens) to be associated with gestational diabetes and dysregulated glucose metabolism. Results for other cardiometabolic health outcomes were inconsistent but suggested certain chemicals may negatively affect cardiometabolic health. Summary: Synthetic chemicals likely adversely affect cardiometabolic health, but current findings were inconclusive. Few recent studies focused on racial/ethnic minorities, low SES, and occupationally exposed populations. To address poor cardiometabolic health and related disparities, more studies across vulnerable populations are warranted. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester; endocrine disruptor; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; cardiovascular disease; female; health; human; pollutant; pregnancy; prospective study; toxicity; vulnerable population; Cardiovascular Diseases; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Health; Humans; Parabens; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Vulnerable Populations

At present, most of the investigations have been conducted in ultrapure water and at concentrations much higher comparing to those detected in the real wastewaters. Furthermore, there are few studies about the toxicity of treated water. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the photocatalytic degradation of PFOX, including photo-oxidative and photo-reductive degradation, is reviewed comprehensively. Compared with photo-oxidation, photo-reduction appears to be more suitable for the PFOX removal since it is more favorable for the defluorination of PFOX and further complete mineralization. The effects of key parameters on the photocatalytic degradation and defluorination process of PFOX are commendably accessed, such as light wavelength, photocatalyst concentration, initial PFOX concentration, pH, reaction atmosphere, temperature, and coexisting organic or inorganic matters. The mechanisms of PFOX photodegradation process are also elucidated in detail.

However, their persistence in the environment, hazardous nature, and potential for bioaccumulation and long-range transport have alarmed an increasing number of scholars and research institutions. Although several literature reviews on PFASs research exist, only a few of them have considered bibliometric indices. In this study, 3,373 PFASs-related articles published between 2001 and 2018 were analyzed using a bibliometric analysis method based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) Expanded. The software tools for mapping knowledge domain (MKD) (VOSviewer and Science of Science (Sci2)) were used to analyze the performance of contributors and PFASs research topics, hotspots, and trends. Our results reveal that the number of PFASs-related articles published annually has increased significantly, with most originating from the United States (followed by those from China). The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published the most articles. A comprehensive analysis of title, keywords, and keywords plus showed that PFASs research hotspots include humans, precursors, and detection methods, with the main focuses being environmental science, toxicology, and environmental engineering. The four main research topics of PFASs were identified, and a literature review was carried out for each one. Overall, this study can supply researchers with a deeper understanding of the development of PFASs studies and provide a comprehensive data reference for researchers to further grasp the research direction in this field. © 2022",Publishing; Bibliometric; Bibliometrics analysis; Global trends; Hotspots; Literature reviews; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Research topics; Sci2; Vosviewer; Biochemistry; bioaccumulation; chemical substance; geochemical survey; spatiotemporal analysis; bibliometrics; China; environmental science; human; review; SciSearch; software; toxicology; trend study; United States; bibliometrics; publication; China; United States; fluorocarbon; Bibliometrics; China; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Publications; United States

The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), was found in the urine of salt mine workers occupationally exposed to diesel emissions, indicating that human exposure to 3-NBA due to diesel emissions can be significant and is detectable. There is clear evidence that 3-NBA is a genotoxic mutagen forming DNA adducts after metabolic activation through simple reduction of the nitro group. Several human enzymes have been shown to activate 3-NBA and its metabolites in vitro and in cells to form electrophilic arylnitrenium and rearranged carbenium ions, leading to the formation of purine adducts at the C8 and N2 position of guanine and at the C8 and N6 position of adenine. The predominant DNA adducts in vivo, 2-(2′-deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-3- aminobenzanthrone and N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone are also the most persistent adducts in target tissue in rodents, and are most probably responsible for the induction of GC→TA transversion mutations observed in vivo. It is concluded that these adducts not only represent premutagenic lesions in DNA but are of primary importance for the initiation of the carcinogenic process and subsequent tumour formation in target tissue. Indeed, 3-NBA is carcinogenic in rats after intratracheal instillation, inducing mainly squamous cell carcinoma in lung. The intention of this article is to provide a critical review on the potential genotoxic effects of 3-NBA on human health. However, in general, there is a need for more mechanistic studies that relate 3-NBA to all processes that are considered to orchestrate tumour development and of studies on the ability of particles to promote 3-NBA genotoxicity. Because of its widespread environmental presence, 3-NBA may represent not only an occupational health hazard but also a hazard for larger sections of the general population. For an accurate risk assessment more epidemiological studies on 3-NBA-exposed individuals and a broader monitoring of environmental levels of 3-NBA are required. © The Author 2005.

Originally found fascinating for its luminescent properties, it has emerged at the forefront for organic electronics due to its particularly high charge carrier mobility for an organic crystal. Despite great interest and its explosion in the literature over the past two decades, the commercial synthesis of rubrene has remained relatively unchanged since its initial discovery in 1926. Several recent studies have reported alternate routes to the rubrene structure with substitutions on the peripheral aromatic rings and tetracene core. Substituting in this manner has the potential to improve upon rubrene's electronic properties. We review the various routes to rubrene and its derivatives and provide a brief overview of the solid-state library available for study. The information gained by comparing the solid-state properties between derivatives offers insight into unpredictable crystallization and polymorphism - complicated issues - which have hindered research into materials applications of rubrene. We hope that these insights inspire work in application-driven synthetic chemistry for future rubrene derivatives. 1 Introduction 2 Synthesis 2.1 Traditional Rubrene Synthesis 2.1.1 Recent Applications 2.2 Multi-Step Synthesis 2.2.1 Historical Routes 2.2.2 Diels-Alder Approaches 2.2.3 Cross-Coupling Approaches 2.2.4 Comparative Synthesis of Perfluororubrene 3 Crystal Engineering 4 Conclusions and Outlook. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

While diet appears the principal source for the majority of western populations (with other pathways like dust ingestion, drinking water and inhalation also important contributors); the role played by exposure to PFOS-precursor compounds followed by in vivo metabolism to PFOS as the ultimate highly stable end-product is unclear. Such PFOS-precursor compounds include perfluorooctane sulfonamide derivates, e.g., perfluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSAs) and sulfonamidoethanols (FOSEs). Understanding the indirect contribution of such precursors to human body burdens of PFOS is important as a significant contribution from this pathway would render the margin of safety between the current exposure limits and estimates of external exposure to PFOS alone, narrower than hitherto appreciated. Estimates derived from mathematical modelling studies, put the contribution of so-called ""precursor exposure"" at between 10% and 40% of total PFOS body burdens. However, there are substantial uncertainties associated with such approaches.

Some industries have publicly reported at least some degree of information regarding their PFAS use, while other industries have reported little, if any, such information publicly. Methods: Publicly available sources were extensively researched for information. Literature searches were performed on key words via a variety of search mechanisms, including existing PFAS use and synthesis literature, patent databases, manufacturers' websites, public government databases, and library catalogs. Additional searches were conducted specifically for suspected or known uses. Results: PFAS have been used in a wide variety of applications, which are summarized into several industries and applications. The expanded literature search yielded additional references as well as greater details, such as concentrations and specific PFAS used, on several previously reported uses. Conclusions: This knowledge will help inform which industries and occupations may lead to potential exposure to workers and to the environment. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",NA

These compounds are of occupational and environmental exposure concern to humans because they are manufactured in significant quantities, widely used, and insufficiently studied for long-term exposure effects and epidemiology. Both human and animal exposure studies indicate that the inhalation of low molecular weight (C1-C8) compounds at high concentrations may produce severe central nervous system depression and respiratory paralysis. Short-term inhalation at microgram per liter concentrations does not cause any significant toxicity in humans, but the odors do cause environmental concern. Some delayed toxicity and mortality are seen after subchronic exposure in animals. Respiratory organs are significantly damaged by the inhalation of MSHC compounds, whereas some organ pathology is observed in the spleen, liver, and kidneys after oral and intraperitoneal administration. Dermal toxicity is observed for several high molecular weight compounds (> C8). Of all the compounds tested, monosulfhydrylbenzene is most injurious to the eyes, whereas other compounds cause moderate irritation. Major detoxication products of MSHC compounds are carbon dioxide and urinary inorganic sulfate. Methylation and oxidation are the major pathways for detoxication, with the lungs and kidneys being major organ routes of excretion.",thiol derivative; animal; drug effect; eye; fish; guinea pig; human; LD 50; liver; lung; occupational medicine; pollutant; rabbit; rat; review; skin; Animal; Environmental Pollutants; Eye; Fishes; Guinea Pigs; Human; Lethal Dose 50; Liver; Lung; Occupational Medicine; Rabbits; Rats; Skin; Sulfhydryl Compounds

Available informations about PFOS contamination in hot spot areas and its bio-accumulation in the food webs have been merged to build up a worst-case scenario We model PFOS transfer from 1 to 100ngL-1 range in water to extensive and free-range food producing animals, also via the spread of contaminated sludges on agriculture soils.

This review aims to (1) identify PFAS sources and fate processes relevant to agricultural systems and (2) expand on plant uptake mechanisms and plant responses to PFAS. Recent Findings: The number of PFAS being quantified in studies involving soil, water, and plants is increasing. Transformation of precursors that tend to stay in the rhizosphere can lead to long-term PFAS reservoir to plants. Some PFAS are readily taken up, particularly the shorter-chain PFAS, and can evoke metabolic responses and phytotoxic effects at high concentrations. PFAS translocation from roots to shoots occurs through both active and passive transport mechanisms. Both PFAS uptake and effects vary between and within species. Summary: As new PFAS emerge, it will be necessary to continue expanding the list of PFAS quantified in land-applied media and assessing their accumulation potential in plants. While controlled laboratory or greenhouse studies have merit, comprehensive field studies are needed to provide clarity on PFAS fate and their relative risk in agricultural systems. Field studies should include identifying site-specific PFAS sources, quantifying a broader suite of PFAS and identifying potential precursors, evaluating plant uptake of replacement PFAS, reporting of soil properties and climatic conditions, and assessing risk of impacts to source and irrigation waters. This information can be utilized to inform future studies towards evaluating and mitigating risks to our food chain associated with PFAS in agricultural systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",NA
"Oberg G., Leopold A.",On the role of review papers in the face of escalating publication rates - a case study of research on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs),2019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.104960,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068533566&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2019.104960&partnerID=40&md5=1cf7e815e3ee57ec691b5033f49f2bfe,"In the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in scientific publications dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and the escalating publication rate makes it close to impossible for individual researchers to get an overview of the field. Assuring the relevance and quality of the research conducted in any research field is a crucially important task. The rapidly increasing publication rates imply that review papers will play a progressively more central role to that end. The aim of the present paper is to critically assess whether reviews dealing with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue about methodological weaknesses, uncertainties, research gaps and the future direction of the field. We carried out a tiered content-analysis of CEC review papers. Relevant papers were identified through searches in Web of Science (Clarivate), leading to the identification of 6391 original research papers of which 193 are review papers. We find that the majority of CEC reviews are written as if they are comprehensive, even though this clearly is not the case. A minority (~20%) take a critical-analytical approach to the reviewing task and identify weaknesses and research gaps. The following widespread tendencies in CEC research papers are commonly noted as concerning: to equate removal of CECs to ‘decreased concentrations in the effluent’; to focus on parent substances and not concern oneself with degradation products; to focus on most commonly studied substances rather than those of most concern; to not deal with the corollary of our inability to detect or assess the risk for all substances, and to give insufficient attention to uncertainties and the unknown. Several critical-analytical reviews are among the highest cited, which suggests that they have the potential to function as effective vehicles for a healthy dialogue on these topics. On the other hand, it would appear that the concerns expressed in these reviews have a limited impact, as the same concerns are repeated over time. This might be due to a tendency among review authors to express their concerns implicitly, instead of clearly spelling them out. Our study suggests that CEC reviews presently fail to provide adequate and reliable guidance regarding the relevance and quality of research in the field. We argue that the overwhelming number of publications in combination with a lack of quality criteria for review papers are reasons to this failure: it is well documented that choices made during the reviewing process have a major impact on the outcome of a review. These choices include: search engine; the criteria used to include or exclude papers; the criteria used to assess the quality of the data generated in the research papers included; the criteria used for the choice of substances/ organisms/ technologies reported on. The lack of transparent procedures makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to assess the quality of the findings presented or to put those findings in context. In this light, it is noteworthy that criteria for a good review paper are rarely spelled out by peer-reviewed journals or included in instructions on scientific writing. The dramatic increase in publications is a challenge for the entire research community, particularly for research fields that are expected to provide policy-relevant data. We argue that only when peer-reviewed journals start specifying quality criteria for review papers, can such papers be relied upon to provide adequate and strategic guidance on the development of CEC research. We anticipate that our findings and conclusions are valid for many other research fields. © 2019 The Authors",Contamination; Degradation; Effluents; Paper; Quality control; Risk assessment; Search engines; Uncertainty analysis; CECs; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Critical analysis; Emerging contaminant; Emerging pollutants; Emerging substances; ESOCs; Quality assessment; Research quality; Review papers; Publishing; critical analysis; data quality; literature review; pollutant; research; attention; content analysis; effluent; human; human experiment; publication; quality control; review; risk assessment; search engine; spelling; systematic review; uncertainty; Web of Science; writing; literature; medical research; pollutant; publishing; Biomedical Research; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Publishing; Review Literature as Topic

In fluoroalkylation reactions, fluorine substitution can dramatically influence the chemical outcome. On the one hand, the chemistry of alkylation with non-fluorinated reagents may not be applicable to fluoroalkylations, so it is necessary to tackle the fluorine effects to achieve efficient fluoroalkylation reactions. On the other hand, fluorine substitution may bring about new reactivities and transformations that cannot be realized in alkylation with non-fluorinated reagents; thus, fluorine substitution can be used to explore new synthetic methods. This tutorial review provides a brief overview of the unique fluorine effects in recently developed nucleophilic, electrophilic, radical, and transition metal-mediated fluoroalkylation reactions by comparing with either their non-fluorinated counterparts or fluorinated counterparts with different numbers of fluorine substituents. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA

Administration of these chemicals to rodents results in a number of effects, the most prominent being hepatomegaly and induction of peroxisomal enzyme activities. Several of these compounds have also been associated with the production of liver tumors in rodents and are classified as nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens. Experimental evidence suggests that humans are not susceptible to these effects following exposure to peroxisome-proliferating compounds. This has led to the proposal that an 'actual threat to humans' from exposure to one of these compounds seems 'rather unlikely'. Indeed, recent reports suggest that peroxisome proliferators may prove valuable as antitumor agents in humans. However, this assessment is preliminary given that peroxisome proliferators also produce a myriad of extraperoxisomal effects in livers and other tissues of experimental animals. Such effects include both stimulation and inhibition of mitochondrial and microsomal metabolism and alteration of the activities of various cytosolic enzymes. These responses may be directly or indirectly related to the effects on peroxisomes or may be totally independent of these events. Whether the extraperoxisomal effects of these compounds occur in humans is not known and their potential impact on human health remains to be investigated.","carboxylic acid derivative; fibric acid derivative; peroxisome proliferator; phenoxyacetic acid derivative; phthalic acid derivative; enzyme induction; health hazard; hepatosplenomegaly; human; microsome; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; peroxisome; review; toxin analysis; Animals; Antilipemic Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinogens; Cytosol; Enzyme Induction; Fatty Acids; Fluorocarbons; Hepatomegaly; Herbicides; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Microbodies; Microsomes, Liver; Mitochondria, Liver; Plasticizers; Rats; Animalia; Rodentia"

Based on information for a few relatively well-understood PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate, there is ample basis to suspect that at least a subset can be considered persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic. However, data suitable for determining risks in either prospective or retrospective assessments are lacking for the majority of PFAS. In August 2019, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry sponsored a workshop that focused on the state-of-the-science supporting risk assessment of PFAS. The present review summarizes discussions concerning the ecotoxicology and ecological risks of PFAS. First, we summarize currently available information relevant to problem formulation/prioritization, exposure, and hazard/effects of PFAS in the context of regulatory and ecological risk assessment activities from around the world. We then describe critical gaps and uncertainties relative to ecological risk assessments for PFAS and propose approaches to address these needs. Recommendations include the development of more comprehensive monitoring programs to support exposure assessment, an emphasis on research to support the formulation of predictive models for bioaccumulation, and the development of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods to efficiently assess biological effects for potentially sensitive species/endpoints. Addressing needs associated with assessing the ecological risk of PFAS will require cross-disciplinary approaches that employ both conventional and new methods in an integrated, resource-effective manner.

Determination of their concentration in environment (such as water bodies, soil, sediment, air) is an indirect tool to estimate the community level consumption of illicit drug and to evaluate potential ecotoxicological impacts from chronic low level exposure. They enter the wastewater network as unaltered drugs and/or their active metabolites by human excretion after illegal consumption or by accidental or deliberate disposal from clandestine drug laboratories. This article critically reviews the occurrence and concentration levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites in different environmental compartments (e.g., wastewater, surface waters, groundwater, drinking water, and ambient air) and their potential impact on the ecosystem. There is limited published information available on the presence of illicit drugs in the environment, reports are available mainly from European countries, UK, USA, and Canada but there is a lack of information from the remainder of the world. Although the environmental concentrations are not very high, they can potentially impact the human health and ecosystem functioning. Cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, and MDMA have potent pharmacological activities and their presence as complex mixtures in water may cause adverse effect on aquatic organisms and human health. However, there is no current regulation demanding the determination of occurrence of these emerging pollutants in treated wastewater, surface water, drinking water, or atmosphere. Thus, critical investigation on distribution pattern of this new group of emerging contaminant and their potential harmful impact on our environment needs immediate attention. © 2012 .","Distribution patterns; Ecosystem functioning; Ecotoxicity; Emerging contaminant; Environmental compartment; Environmental concentration; Illicit drug; Pharmacological activity; Biomolecules; Complex networks; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Metabolites; Pollution; Surface waters; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Wastewater disposal; 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine; amphetamine; benzoylecgonine; cannabinoid; cocaine; drinking water; dronabinol; ecgonine methyl ester; ground water; homococaine; illicit drug; methamphetamine; morphine; norcocaine; opiate; surface water; ambient air; concentration (composition); drinking water; drug; ecosystem response; ecotoxicology; environmental impact; groundwater; metabolite; pollutant source; surface water; wastewater; ambient air; aquatic environment; atmosphere; Canada; ecosystem; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental impact; metabolite; pollutant; prevalence; priority journal; review; United Kingdom; United States; waste water; waste water management; Canada; United Kingdom; United States; Ecotoxicity; Emerging contaminant; Groundwater; Illicit drug; Surface water; Wastewater; Air Pollutants; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Soil Pollutants; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Formamidopyrimidines, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua), are among the major lesions generated in DNA by hydroxyl radical attack, UV radiation, or photosensitization under numerous in vitro and in vivo conditions. They are formed by one-electron reduction of C8-OH-adduct radicals of purines and thus have a common precursor with 8-hydroxypurines generated upon one-electron oxidation. Methodologies using mass spectrometry exist to accurately measure FapyAde and FapyGua in vitro and in vivo. Formamidopyrimidines are repaired by base excision repair. Numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA glycosylases are highly specific for removal of these lesions from DNA in the first step of this repair pathway, indicating their biological importance. FapyAde and FapyGua are bypassed by DNA polymerases with the insertion of the wrong intact base opposite them, leading to mutagenesis. In mammalian cells, the mutagenicity of FapyGua exceeds that of 8-hydroxyguanine, which is thought to be the most mutagenic of the oxidatively induced lesions in DNA. The background and formation levels of the former in vitro and in vivo equal or exceed those of the latter under various conditions. FapyAde and FapyGua exist in living cells at significant background levels and are abundantly generated upon exposure to oxidative stress. Mice lacking the genes that encode specific DNA glycosylases accumulate these lesions in different organs and, in some cases, exhibit a series of pathological conditions including metabolic syndrome and cancer. Animals exposed to environmental toxins accumulate formamidopyrimidines in their organs. Here, we extensively review the mechanisms of formation, measurement, repair, and biological effects of formamidopyrimidines that have been investigated in the past 50 years. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of these neglected lesions in many biological and disease processes.","2,6 diamino 4 hydroxy 5 formamidopyrimidine; 4,6 diamino 5 formamidopyrimidine; 8 hydroxyguanine; DNA glycosyltransferase; hydroxyl radical; pyrimidine derivative; unclassified drug; carcinogenesis; DNA damage; enzyme specificity; excision repair; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mass spectrometry; metabolic syndrome X; mutagenesis; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; photosensitization; priority journal; reduction; review; ultraviolet radiation; DNA; DNA Repair; DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase; Humans; Pyrimidines; Animalia; Eukaryota; Mammalia; Mus; Prokaryota"

N-Dealkylation is favored over N-oxygenation for secondary and tertiary amines with both kinds of enzymes, but in the peroxidase-like enzymes N-oxygenation is even less favorable because of apparent restriction of the Fe-O complex in the active site. Among the rat liver P450s many of the carcinogenic primary arylamines and heterocyclic amines are N-oxygenated by P450 1A2 to form the N-hydroxy arylamine derivatives. Studies with human liver P450s also indicate that P450 1A2 plays a major role in such reactions, although some arylamines such as 4,4'-methylene-bis (3-chloroaniline) and dapsone are preferentially N-oxygenated by P450 3A4. Caffeine N3-demethylation has been developed as a useful marker of P450 1A2 levels in humans; the knowledge that P450 1A2 is the major phenacetin O-deethylase also allows insight into previous human interaction studies. 2-Ethynylnaphthalene is a useful mechanism-based inactivator of rat and rabbit P450 1A2 but not human P450 1A2 enzymes; the peptides labeled in the enzymes have been identified, along with the region in rat P450 1A2 that is modified with the photoaffinity label 4-azidobiphenyl. Microcrystals of rabbit P450 1A2 have been obtained as a first course to realizing the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes. Evidence is also presented that the major C8-guanyl DNA adducts resulting from these arylamines and heterocyclic amines in DNA may be formed via rearrangement of an initial N7-guanyl-2-arylamine adduct: reaction of N-acetoxy-2-aminofluorene with C8-methylguanine derivatives led to the formation of stable N7-substituted species, and reaction of N-acetoxy-2-aminofluorene with C8-bromoguanine yielded N-(C8-guanosinyl)-2-aminofluorene in a reaction best rationalized by such a mechanism.","amine; carcinogen; cytochrome P450 1A2; guanine; heterocyclic compound; mutagenic agent; amino acid sequence; animal; biotransformation; chemistry; DNA adduct; enzyme specificity; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; rabbit; rat; review; sequence homology; Amines; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Biotransformation; Carcinogens; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; DNA Adducts; Guanine; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagens; Rabbits; Rats; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity"

Consequently, there is no obligation to measure their air concentration in the workplace. However, the employer is responsible for determining whether or not a given hazardous agent is present in the work environment.

The purpose of this study was to understand the levels and profiles of POPs in breast milk in China and assess their potential health risks among breastfed infants under six months of age. A literature review focused on China was performed for studies published from 2001 to 2020. The POP levels in breast milk along with other important variables were extracted, and then the average individual POP levels in breast milk were estimated. This review summarises the distribution of traditional and new POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), legacy brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and reported notably high levels of short-chain chlorinated paraffins and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p’-DDE) in breast milk. Although the levels of traditional POPs generally declined over time, especially p,p’-DDE and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), women living in coastal areas, urban areas, and southern China still have a high body burden of certain POPs. In the present study, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of POPs through breastfeeding was used to evaluate the health risk for infants by comparing with acceptable levels. The findings suggested that infants born in coastal areas most likely suffered potential health risk from exposure to DDT, and the health risk of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in infants in most nationwide regions remains a concern. More importantly, the EDI of PCBs for infants exceeds the safe limit on a national scale.

These compounds have been employed in combination with non-fluorinated amino acids in the design of peptides and peptidomimetics for investigation of their proteolytic stability and influence of molecular composition on the folding properties and biological activity. Fluorinatedβ-amino acids serve as precursors for the β-lactam antibiotics and fluoroalkene dipeptide isosteres or as structural components of analogues of natural products. There are several general methods available for introducing into β-amino acids either one or two fluorine atoms at the -position, as well as α- or β-fluoroalkyl substituents; these methods include reduction of fluorinated β-imino esters, biomimetic transamination of fluorinated carbonyl compounds, Michael-type addition to trifluorocrotonate and α-trifluoromethacrylate derivatives, and Reformatsky and Mannich-type reactions of fluorinated substrates. Fluorinated aziridines and β-lactams have been employed as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of the corresponding β-amino acids by facile ring-opening reactions. Other methods discussed in review are fluorination and trifluoromethylation of β-amino acid derivatives, reactions of organometallic reagents with fluorinated imines and related compounds, and metathesis reactions of fluorinated imino esters and imidoyl halides for the synthesis of cyclic derivatives. 1 Introduction 2 Fluorination and Trifluoromethylation of β-amino acid derivatives 3 Reduction of Fluorinated α-imino esters 4 Biomimetic Transamination of Fluorinated Carbonyl Compounds 5 Michael-Type Additions to β- Trifluorocrotonate and β-Trifluoromethacrylate Derivatives 6 Reformatsky-Type Reaction of Fluorinated Substrates 7 Mannich-Type Reactions of Fluorinated Substrates 8 Cycloaddition Reactions of Fluoroalkyl Imines 9 Reactions of Organometallic Reagents with Fluorinated Imines and Related Compounds 10 Metathesis Reactions 11 Miscellaneous Reactions 12 Conclusions © Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York.",Amino acid derivatives; asymmetric synthesis; Aziridines; Biologically active compounds; biomimetic synthesis; Cyclic derivatives; Cycloaddition reaction; Dipeptide; Fluorine atoms; Folding properties; General method; Imidoyl halides; Mannich-type reactions; Metathesis reactions; Miscellaneous reactions; Molecular compositions; Natural products; Organometallic reagent; Peptidomimetics; Proteolytic stability; Reformatsky-type reactions; Related compounds; Ring opening reaction; Structural component; Synthetic intermediates; Synthetic methodology; Synthetic methods; Trifluoromethylation; Amides; Bioactivity; Biomimetics; Carbonyl compounds; Cycloaddition; Esterification; Esters; Fluorination; Fluorine; Halogenation; Nitrogen compounds; Organometallics; Peptides; Synthesis (chemical); Amino acids; alkyl group; aziridine derivative; beta amino acid; beta amino acid derivative; beta lactam antibiotic; carbonyl derivative; crotonic acid derivative; dipeptide derivative; ester derivative; fluorine; halide; imine; methacrylic acid derivative; organometallic compound; unclassified drug; amino acid analysis; amino acid synthesis; biological activity; biomimetics; cycloaddition; diastereoisomer; fluorination; Mannich reaction; Michael addition; oxidation reduction reaction; protein folding; protein methylation; protein stability; Reformatsky reaction; review; ring closing metathesis; ring opening; stereochemistry

This results in the need for mechanistic models to describe the physicochemical properties of ions, like the membrane-water partition coefficient (Kmw), which is related to toxicity and bioaccumulation. In this work we compare 3 different and already existing modelling approaches to describe the liposome-water partition coefficient (Klipw) of organic ions, including 36 cations, 56 anions, 2 divalent cations and 2 zwitterions (plus 207 neutral compounds for ensuring model consistency). 1) The empirical correlation with the octanol-water partition coefficient of the corresponding neutral species yielded better results for the prediction of anions (RMSE = 0.79) than for cations (RMSE = 1.14). Though describing most anions reasonably well, the lack of mechanistic basis and the poor performance for cations constrain the usage of this model. 2) The polyparameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER) model performs worse (RMSE = 1.26/1.12 for anions/cations). The different physicochemical environments, due to different sorption depths into the membrane of the different species, cannot be described with a single pp-LFER model. 3) COSMOmic is based on quantum chemistry and fluid phase thermodynamics and has the widest applicability domain. It was the only model applicable for multiply charged ions and gave the best results for anions (RMSE = 0.66) and cations (RMSE = 0.71). We expect COSMOmic to contribute to a better estimation of the environmental risk of ionizable emerging pollutants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric chemistry; Biochemistry; Forecasting; Free energy; Ions; Liposomes; Phospholipids; Physicochemical properties; Positive ions; Quantum chemistry; Risk perception; COSMOmic; Empirical correlations; Liposome-water partition coefficients; Octanol-water partition coefficient; Partitioning; Physicochemical environments; Polyparameter linear free energy relationships; Water partition coefficients; Membranes; ampholyte; anion; cation; divalent cation; liposome; water; octanol; phospholipid; pollutant; water; ion; membrane; modeling; partition coefficient; partitioning; phospholipid; water; bioaccumulation; comparative study; equilibrium dialysis; hydrogen bond; molecular dynamics; partition coefficient; phospholipid membrane; quantum chemistry; Review; solvation; static electricity; thermodynamics; chemistry; pollutant; theoretical model; 1-Octanol; Environmental Pollutants; Liposomes; Models, Theoretical; Phospholipids; Thermodynamics; Water"

My career began in internal medicine, shifted to pediatrics, and clinical practice changed to research. My research interest was initially in hematology: on plasma proteins, their metabolism, synthesis, and function. This narrowed to a focus on proteins of the human complement system, their role in immunity and their genetics, beginning with polymorphism and deficiency of C3. My group identified genetic polymorphisms and/or inherited deficiencies of C2, C4, C6, and C8. After defining glycine-rich beta glycoprotein as factor B (Bf) in the properdin system, we found that the genes for Bf (CFB), C2, C4A, and C4B were inherited as a single haplotypic unit which we named the “complotype.” Complotypes are located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) between HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 and are designated (in arbitrary order) by their CFB, C2, C4A, and C4B types. Pedigree analysis revealed long stretches (several megabases) of apparently fixed DNA within the MHC that we referred to as “extended haplotypes” (later as “CEHs”). About 10 to 12 common CEHs constitute at least 25 – 30% of MHC haplotypes among European Caucasian populations. These CEHs contain virtually all the most common markers of MHC-associated diseases. In the case of type 1 diabetes, we have proposed a purely genetic and epigenetic model (with a small number of Mendelian recessive disease genes) that explains all the puzzling features of the disease, including its rising incidence. © Copyright © 2021 Alper.",haptoglobin; HLA B antigen; HLA DQB1 antigen; HLA DRB1 antigen; allele; chromosomal mapping; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical practice; complement deficiency; complement system; DNA sequence; epigenetics; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic marker; genetic model; genetic polymorphism; genetic susceptibility; genotype; haplotype; HLA typing; human; incidence; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major histocompatibility complex; pedigree analysis; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism

Such drug delivery systems differ from conventional drug dosage forms (pills, tablets, ointments, creams, injectables and 'tiny time capsules') in that a localised depot of drug provides patterned release of the active agent with a pre-determined time course. The pattern of drug release may be constant, oscillating, declining continuously, or even pulsatile. The need to engineer different release patterns for drugs of different molecular sizes, potency, stability and hydrophobicity provides the impetus for active study of the design of new biomaterials, intelligent delivery systems and approaches for delivery through different portals in the body. The field of controlled drug delivery provides a driving force for current innovations in biomaterials. For most drug delivery systems, polymers function simply as inert, biocompatible carriers. In other systems, polymers can be designed with targeting or pathology-responsive functions. This review summarises some of the recently developed intellectual property in the field of biomaterials applied to drug delivery systems.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous inorganic-organic hybrid networks synthesized by multi-dentate organic ligands. Due to their large specific surface area, high adsorption capacity, adjustable porosity, layered structure and recyclable performance, they are considered as important materials for the adsorption and removal of emerging pollutants (ECs) in wastewater and has been widely studied. However, due to their instability and difficulty in recycling in aqueous media, their application as an adsorbent are limited, and hence further investigation and syntheses of materials to overcome this shortcoming remains an arduous task. With these viewpoints, in presented review, the utility of MOFs to adsorption properties and related mechanism to remove drugs viz. antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, antipsychotics, organophosphorus pesticides and other drugs from wastewater are presented. Additionally, rational ideas for constructing water stable MOFs with apt functionalization are discussed that can engender targeted MOFs with improved adsorption efficiency of drugs in wastewater. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Adsorption; Crystalline materials; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organic polymers; Pollution; Adsorption mechanism; Aqueous environment; Drug; Ecosystem health; Global problems; Human health; Hybrid network; Inorganic-organic hybrid; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Synthesised; Organometallics

The far infrared portion of the spectrum (10-600 cm - 1) is measured with a polarizing interferometer having thermopile detectors with a common 4-mrad field of view (FOV). The middle infrared portion is measured with a traditional Michelson interferometer having two focal planes (600-1100 cm- 1, 1100-1400 cm- 1). Each focal plane is composed of a 1× 10 array of HgCdTe detectors, each detector having a 0.3-mrad FOV. CIRS observations will provide three-dimensional maps of temperature, gas composition, and aerosols/condensates of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn with good vertical and horizontal resolution, from deep in their tropospheres to high in their mesospheres. CIRS's ability to observe atmospheres in the limb-viewing mode (in addition to nadir) offers the opportunity to provide accurate and highly resolved vertical profiles of these atmospheric variables. The ability to observe with high-spectral resolution should facilitate the identification of new constituents. CIRS will also map the thermal and compositional properties of the surfaces of Saturn's icy satellites. It will similarly map Saturn's rings, characterizing their dynamical and spatial structure and constraining theories of their formation and evolution. The combination of broad spectral range, programmable spectral resolution, the small detector fields of view, and an orbiting spacecraft platform will allow CIRS to observe the Saturnian system in the thermal infrared at a level of detail not previously achieved. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Atmospheric temperature; Heat radiation; Infrared radiation; Infrared spectroscopy; Interferometers; Light polarization; Optical resolving power; Orbits; Atmospheric compositions; Atmospheric dynamics; Cassini; Saturn; Saturn's moons; Saturn's rings; Titan; Planets; air temperature; astronomy; infrared spectroscopy; review; space flight

With the emergence and development of miniaturized and portable devices in numerous scientific and technological fields, there has been an urgent need for on-chip FTSs due to their benefits of small size, portability, low energy consumption, and robustness. However, the small size of on-chip FTSs hinders the acquisition of a large optical path difference, resulting in a low resolution of the spectrometer. In addition, the sampler spacing is not sufficiently small to satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, directly influencing the bandwidth of the spectrometer. Therefore, studies have been performed to investigate the trade-off between the reduced size and performance of spectrometers. This paper aims to systematically review the progress in on-chip FTSs, especially in on-chip static FTSs, including spatially modulated, temporally modulated, and space-time comodulated FTSs, from the aspects of theories, implementations, and performance indicators.

Those molecular alterations can be found in the bloodstream, which suggests that we could quantify specific biomarkers in plasma or serum by very sensitive methods before the onset diabetes mellitus is diagnosed. However, classical methods of protein analysis such as electrophoresis, Western blot, ELISA, and liquid chromatography are generally time-consuming, lab-intensive, and not sensitive enough to detect such alteration in a pre-symptomatic state of the disease. Method A very sensitive and novel analytical detection conjugate system by using the combination of polyfluorophor technology with protein microchip method was developed. Results This innovative system facilitates the use of a very sensitive microchip assays that measure selected biomarkers in a small sample volume (10 μL) with a much higher sensitivity (92%) compare to common immune assay systems. Further advances of the application of this technology combine the power of miniaturization and faster quantification (around 10 min). Conclusion The power of this technology offers great promise for point-of-care clinical testing and monitoring of specific biomarkers for diabetes in femtogram level in serum or plasma. In conclusion, the results indicate that the technical performance of this new technology is valid and that the assay is able to quantified PPY-specific antigens in plasma at femtogram levels which can be used for identification of beta cell dysfunction at the pre-symptomatic stage of diabetes mellitus. © European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2017.",biopsy technique; biotechnology; cell damage; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic equipment; diagnostic error; diagnostic test; diagnostic value; disease course; disease marker; human; immunoassay; in vitro diagnostic assay; in vitro study; laboratory diagnosis; measurement; microchip analysis; miniaturization; molecular biology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; point of care testing; private health insurance; protein determination; public health insurance; Review; sensitivity and specificity; symptom

Today, the technique of choice for analysis of these groups of substances is liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). In the last decades, this technique has experienced an impressive progress that has made possible the analysis of many environmental pollutants in a faster, more convenient, and more sensitive way, and, in some cases, the analysis of compounds that could not be determined before. This article reviews the LC-MS and LC-MS-MS methods published so far for the determination of alkylphenolic surfactants, steroid sex hormones and drugs in the aquatic environment. Practical considerations with regards to the analysis of these groups of substances by using different mass spectrometers (single quadrupole, ion trap and triple quadrupole instruments, etc.), interfaces and ionization and monitoring modes, are presented. Sample preparation aspects, with special focus on the application of advanced techniques, such as immunosorbents, restricted access materials and molecular imprinted materials, for extraction/purification of aquatic environmental samples and extracts are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

NA,Causal Inference Considerations for Endocrine Disruptor Research in Children's Health,2013,NA,NA,"Substantial population exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, combined with available biomarkers and public concern, has resulted in an explosion of human health effects research. At the same time, remarkable shifts in the regulations governing the composition of some consumer products that contain endocrine disruptors (EDs) has occurred. However, important questions remain as to the weight of evidence linking EDs to human health end points. In this review, we critically examine the literature linking ED exposures to child neurodevelopment, focusing in particular on two model exposures to demonstrate issues related to bioaccumulative [e. g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and rapidly metabolized (e. g., phthalates) compounds, respectively. Issues of study design, confounding, and exposure measurement are considered. Given widespread exposure to these compounds, the potential public health consequences of even small effects on human health are substantial. Therefore, advancing our understanding of any impact calls for careful attention to the principles of causal inference.",NA

Unlike the membranes for hydrogen fuelled PEM fuel cells, among which perfluorosulfonic acid based membranes show complete domination, the membranes for DMFC have numerous variations, each has its advantages and disadvantages. No single membrane is emerging as absolutely superior to others. This review outlines the prospects of the currently known membranes for DMFC. The membranes are evaluated according to various properties, including: methanol crossover, proton conductivity, durability, thermal stability and maximum power density. Hydrocarbon and composite fluorinated membranes currently show the most potential for low cost membranes with low methanol permeability and high durability. Some of these membranes are already beginning to impact the portable fuel cell market. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The largest flux of F at the Earth's surface derives from the mobilization of F during chemical (2.2 Tg F/yr (where 1 Tg = 1012 g) and mechanical (7 Tg F/yr) weathering of rocks. Humans supplement these fluxes by mining fluorospar and apatite ores to make a variety of industrial chemicals and fertilizers, mobilizing 2.9 and 7.6 Tg F/yr, respectively. Other large anthropogenic fluxes derive from the manufacture of bricks (1.8 Tg F/yr) and extraction of groundwater (0.9 to 1.7 Tg F/yr). Rivers deliver ~3.6 Tg/yr of dissolved fluoride to the oceans, where the mean residence time of dissolved F in seawater is ~500,000 yr. F is removed from the oceans by the deposition of terrigenous (4.3 Tg F/yr) and authigenic sediments (1.24 Tg F/yr), and approximately 10 Tg F/yr is removed from the surface of the Earth by subduction of the oceanic lithosphere. Humans have increased the flux of F to the atmosphere and in rivers by more than a factor of 2, with the largest impacts stemming from the use of phosphorus fertilizers, the production of brick, and extraction of groundwater. Despite their well-documented toxicity, perfluoroalkyl substances make only a small contribution to F emitted to the atmosphere and natural waters. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Although preeclampsia is a subject of many research projects, the etiology of the condition remains unclear. One of the hypotheses related to the etiology of preeclampsia is the deficiency in placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2), the enzyme which in normal pregnancy protects the fetus from the excess of maternal cortisol. The reduced activity of the enzyme was observed in placentas from pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia. That suggests the overexposure of the developing child to maternal cortisol, which in high levels exerts proapoptotic effects and reduces fetal growth. The fetal growth restriction due to the diminished placental 11β-HSD2 function may be supported by the fact that preeclampsia is often accompanied with fetal hypotrophy. The causes of the reduced function of 11β-HSD2 in placental tissue are still discussed. This paper summarizes the phenomena that may affect the activity of the enzyme at various steps on the way from the gene to the protein. © 2016 Katarzyna Kosicka et al.",11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; butylated hydroxyanisole; cadmium; caffeine; chorionic gonadotropin; dithiocarbamic acid derivative; glycyrrhetinic acid; interleukin 1; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipoxin A; messenger RNA; microRNA; naringenin; organotin compound; paraxanthine; perfluoro compound; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phthalic acid; progesterone; triclosan; tumor necrosis factor alpha; ziram; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; enzyme activity; enzyme mechanism; gene expression; HSD11B2 gene; human; preeclampsia; protein expression; protein function; Review

The role of promoters’ type and their amount loaded into the catalyst are described and discussed for both, iron- (Cu, K, Na, S, Zr, Ni) and cobalt (Ru, Pt, Re, Zr, Ag, Rh, Ir, Au)-based catalysts, respectively, as same as the role of catalyst supports and reaction conditions. Catalyst supports discussed in this work are from the group of oxides, mesoporous silicas and zeolites, carbon-based materials, and carbides. Reaction conditions studied and discussed are reaction temperature, gas hourly space velocity of syngas and hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio in syngas and reaction pressure. For iron-based catalysts, reaction temperature is discussed in the range of 508–613 K, while for cobalt types in the range of 468–513 K. Reaction pressure is discussed for both catalyst types up to 3 MPa. All the parameters are presented and discussed using FTS selectivity to main groups of products, such as CH4, CO2, C2–C4 hydrocarbons, and C5+ hydrocarbons together with syngas conversion degree. Detailed review of data published in articles studying FTS over iron and cobalt catalysts supplied large data set for presenting and discussion of trends and effects of aimed parameters and for their visualization in form of set of charts.

The Mollicutes (Mycoplasma, Acholeplasma, Spiroplasma) evolved by regressive evolution to generate one of the simplest and minimal free-living and self-replicating forms of life. The spiroplasmas are the more advanced members in the class and are the closest to their clostridial ancestors. Spiroplasmas were discovered and identified as such only in 1972 and the finding of a unique and well-defined internal cytoskeleton, believed to be uncommon in bacteria, followed in 1973. Structural analysis suggests that the core of the spiroplasmal cytoskeleton is a flat, monolayered ribbon comprised of the 59-kDa fib gene product. The ribbon follows the shortest helical line of the polar cell from end to end. The structural building blocks of the cytoskeletal ribbon are fibrils assembling into a structure with ∼10-nm axial and lateral repeats. Differential length changes of the fibrils may generate a wide dynamic spectrum of helical and non-helical geometries allowing for directional motility in low Reynolds number environments. The presence of other cytoskeletal elements (FtsZ, FtsA, EF-TU, MreB) has been demonstrated only recently in Spiroplasma cells. The cellular and molecular structure and dynamics of spiroplasmas and their cytoskeletal elements are reviewed. Copyright © 2006 S.

Patients can also present other extra glandular manifestations, such as arthritis, anaemia and fatigue or various types of organ involvement. Due to its heterogenicity, along with the lack of effective treatments, the diagnosis and management of this disease is challenging. The objective of this review is to summarize recent multi-omic publications aiming to identify biomarkers in tears, saliva and peripheral blood from SS patients that could be relevant for their better stratification aiming at improved treatment selection and hopefully better outcomes. We highlight the relevance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon (IFN) as biomarkers identified in higher concentrations in serum, saliva and tears. Transcriptomic studies confirmed the upregulation of IFN and interleukin signalling in patients with SS, whereas immunophenotyping studies have shown dysregulation in the immune cell population frequencies, specifically CD4+and C8+T activated cells, and their correlations with clinical parameters, such as disease activity scores. Lastly, we discussed emerging findings derived from different omic technologies which can provide integrated knowledge about SS pathogenesis and facilitate personalised medicine approaches leading to better patient outcomes in the future. © 2022 by the authors.",NA

The analysis of the intrinsic effects of perfluorinated organic surfactants shows the group to have a characteristic overall picture: - high polarity - high thermal and chemical stability - ubiquitous distribution - non-biodegradability - multiple toxicity In addition, certain substances belonging to this group (e.g. PFOS) exhibit a very long retention time in the human body. Toxic properties vary and, like the mechanisms for global distribution, have not been fully clarified. In the meantime, individual members of this substance group have been (are being) removed from the market. This report shows that in future the planned EU chemicals law (REACH) can be used to prevent such substances being regulated after they have been distributed in the environment and thus after damage has already occurred. To this end, however, the requirements for registration for low tonnage substances (1-10 tonnes/a) must be supplemented with specific tests (in particular on biodegradability). Aim and Scope. The aim of the work was to analyse the intrinsic properties and risks of a subgroup of fluorinated organic substances. Results. A summarising article describes the toxic effects and properties of a group of substances selected from the approximately 30,000 existing substances. With regard to the ongoing debate on revising the European regulations of existing substances (REACH), it is apparent that standardised test requirements cannot be applied to impact and risk analyses which are at times highly complex. For governments, REACH only provides the starting points for this process in the form of prescribed standard tests. If a substance (or a substance group) draws attention, more detailed tests must be carried out by the industry itself in the framework of responsible care and in the framework of the evaluation step of REACH. It is therefore important that the standard requirements of REACH are selected appropriately. In this respect, the study reveals some serious deficiencies in the Commission proposal. Conclusion. The standard information for low tonnage substances (1-10 tonnes/a) must be supplemented in particular with an obligatory test on biodegradability. The possibility provided by the REACH dossier to evaluate substances on the basis of group observations (SAR, QSAR e.g.) is to be welcomed.",octane; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; sulfonic acid derivative; surfactant; unclassified drug; biodegradability; chemistry; dangerous goods; ecotoxicity; environmental protection; European Union; European Union Commission; geographic distribution; government regulation; information; law; molecular stability; polarization; quantitative structure activity relation; Registration Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals; review; risk assessment; standardization; thermostability; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics

The focus will be on the use of polypyrrole as a linker between a substrate and oligonucleotide probes. The modification step is based on the electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and oligonucleotides bearing a pyrrole group on its 5′ end. This strategy was employed for the immobilization of oligonucleotides on millimeter-sized electrodes, microelectrode arrays, as well as for the local structuring of homogeneous gold surfaces. Our approaches for the localized patterning of gold surfaces will be also discussed. Localized immobilization was achieved by using an electrospotting technique, where a micropipette served as an electrochemical cell where spot sizes with 800 μm diameters were fabricated. The use of a microcell using a Teflon covered metal needle with a cavity of 100 μm resulted in immobilized probe spots of 300 μm. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was also used, and surface modifications of 100 μm were obtained depending on the experimental conditions. Different detection methods were employed for the reading of the hybridization event: fluorescence imaging, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI), photocurrent measurements, and voltamperometric measurements using intercalators. Their advantages concerning the various immobilization strategies will also be discussed. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.",NA

Originally known as 'serum thymic factor' (FTS), thymulin binds to a carrier protein and zinc (Zn2+) to exert its biologic properties. Thymulin, albeit an essential hormone for the T lymphocyte differentiation and the normalization of the ratio of T-helper cells to suppressor cells, accumulating evidence suggests its involvement in inflammations of various etiologies. Recently, thymulin has been shown to have anti-nociceptive effects in hyperalgesia and in pain of neurogenic origin, ostensibly through action on sensory afferents and the release of anti-inflammatory mediators. Given its anti-inflammatory potential, thymulin downregulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-10, and exerts molecular control via the regulation of transcription factors and mediators. Recent evidence tends to indicate that thymulin can be a therapeutic agent in many inflammatory diseases and in pathological conditions affecting the peripheral and/or the central nervous system.

This method extracts the substances by co-solvation with methanol and measures targeted compounds using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. ASTM D7979 is a performance-based method that analyzes 31 compounds plus 14 isotopically labeled surrogates. The minimum reporting limit is approximately 10 ng/L with an analytical range of 10–200 ng/L for most compounds. Expected recovery of surrogates and spiked matrices is 70–130%. Samples containing high suspended solids can be analyzed with minimal interferences and potential loss of analyte. The method is consistent with ASTM and EPA's sustainable development goals by using reduced volumes of sample, solvent, and minimizing hazardous solvents and sample preparation materials while maintaining data quality and detection limits that are suitable for the intended use.

The objectives here are to: 1) provide data on changes in human contaminant concentrations and exposure among Canadian Arctic peoples; 2) identify new contaminants of concern; 3) discuss possible health effects; 4) outline risk communication about contaminants in country food; and 5) identify knowledge gaps for future contaminant research and monitoring. The nutritional and cultural benefits of country foods are substantial; however, some dietary studies suggest declines in the amount of country foods being consumed. Significant declines were found for most contaminants in maternal blood over the last 10. years within all three Arctic regions studied. Inuit continue to have the highest levels of almost all persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals among the ethnic groups studied. A greater proportion of people in the East exceed Health Canada's guidelines for PCBs and mercury, although the proportion of mothers exceeding these guidelines has decreased since the previous assessment. Further monitoring and research are required to assess trends and health effects of emerging contaminants. Infant development studies have shown possible subtle effects of prenatal exposure to heavy metals and some POPs on immune system function and neurodevelopment. New data suggest important beneficial effects on brain development for Inuit infants from some country food nutrients. The most successful risk communication processes balance the risks and benefits of a diet of country food through input from a variety of regional experts and the community, to incorporate the many socio-cultural and economic factors to arrive at a risk management decision that will be the most beneficial in Arctic communities. © 2010.","Arctic health; Country food; Environmental contaminant; Infant; Maternal; Organochlorines; Risk communication; Arctic engineering; Communication; Contamination; Health; Health risks; Impurities; Mercury (metal); Metals; Nutrition; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Risk analysis; Risk management; Chemical contamination; heavy metal; lead; mercury; methylmercury; perfluoro compound; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; sex hormone; arctic environment; diet; ethnic group; health risk; heavy metal; maternal health; organic pollutant; organochlorine; polar region; pollution exposure; risk assessment; Arctic; brain development; Canada; child development; climate change; cultural factor; decision making; economic aspect; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; Eskimo; food composition; food contamination; food intake; health hazard; human; immune response; infant mortality; information dissemination; knowledge; life expectancy; medical expert; medical research; mercurialism; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; nutritional health; oxidative stress; prenatal exposure; priority journal; review; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; risk management; social aspect; Adolescent; Adult; Arctic Regions; Canada; Climate Change; Diet; Disease; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Female; Health Status; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Canada"

CO2, being a major component of greenhouse gases, draws more attention towards carbon capture and utilization (CCU) into energy rich products. Among all the CCU products, higher hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ethers are more desirable than low carbon-based products due to their featuring high energy density and minimal emissions. In this context, major advancements are being achieved in the production of fuels and fuel additives like ethanol, ethylene, ethane, dimethyl ether, light olefins (C2–C4 olefins), jet fuels (C8–C16 alkanes and cycloalkanes), aromatic products, etc. from CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Hence, it is imperative to compile and analyze its important features regarding catalyst environment, mechanistic insights, conversion efficiency, product selectivity and so on from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In our review, we comprehensively evaluate the developments towards promoting CO2 hydrogenation to high carbon-based products. We intend to present the possible schemes, current challenges, and the expected future research pathways towards designing efficient catalytic systems for CO2 reduction reaction.

This class, comprising of thousands of chemicals, have been used in many different products ranging from firefighting foam to personal care products and clothes. Even at relatively low levels of exposure, PFAS have been linked to various health effects in humans such as lower birth weight, increased serum cholesterol levels, and reduced antibody response to vaccination. Human biomonitoring data demonstrates ubiquitous exposure to PFAS across all age groups. This has been attributed to PFAS-contaminated water and dietary intake, as well as inadvertent ingestion of indoor dust for adults and toddlers. In utero exposure and breast milk have been indicated as important exposure pathways for foetuses and nursing infants. More recently, PFAS have been identified in a wide range of products, many of which come in contact with skin (e.g., cosmetics and fabrics). Despite this, few studies have evaluated dermal uptake as a possible route for human exposure and little is known about the dermal absorption potential of different PFAS. This article critically investigates the current state-of-knowledge on human exposure to PFAS, highlighting the lack of dermal exposure data. Additionally, the different approaches for dermal uptake assessment studies are discussed and the available literature on human dermal absorption of PFAS is critically reviewed and compared to other halogenated contaminants, e.g., brominated flame retardants and its implications for dermal exposure to PFAS. Finally, the urgent need for dermal permeation and uptake studies for a wide range of PFAS and their precursors is highlighted and recommendations for future research to advance the current understanding of human dermal exposure to PFAS are discussed. © 2022 The Authors",Flame retardants; Water pollution; 'current; 3d-human skin equivalent; Dermal absorption; Dermal exposure; Dermal uptake; Human exposures; Human skin; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Skin equivalents; Biochemistry; chemical compound; flame retardant; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; flame retardant; fluorocarbon; chemical pollutant; environmental risk; health impact; health risk; pollution exposure; skin; three-dimensional modeling; bioavailability; environmental exposure; human; in vivo study; pollutant; Review; skin absorption; adult; biological monitoring; dust; environmental exposure; female; infant; Adult; Biological Monitoring; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Female; Flame Retardants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant

This scoping review summarizes the chemistry of PFAS exposure and the epidemiologic evidence for associations between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the development of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and/or insulin resistance. We identified 11 studies on gestational diabetes mellitus, 3 studies on type 1 diabetes, 7 studies on type 2 diabetes, 6 studies on prediabetes or unspecified diabetes, and 15 studies on insulin resistance or glucose tolerance using the SCOPUS and PubMed databases. Approximately 24 reported positive associations, 9 negative associations, 2 non-linear associations, and 2 inverse associations, and 8 reported no associations found between PFAS and all diabetes search terms.

Due to the unquiet strength of the highly polarized carbon-fluorine bond (C–F) and their hydrophobic/lipophobic feature as well as biological persistence properties, the remediation and treatment of PFASs is a big challenge. Preliminary studies indicate that a few kinds of technical approaches could remove or transfer PFASs, but the effectiveness is not high as expected or limited while most of the techniques are only tested at laboratory scale. A review of existing treatment technologies was thus conducted for the purpose to outlook these technologies, and more importantly, to propose the foreseeable technique. As such, a constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) technology was recommended, which is a newly emerged technology by integrating physical, chemical and enhanced biological processes plus the wetland plants function with strong eco-friendly feature for a comprehensive removal of PFASs.

These oligomers can form the self-assembled molecular aggregates with the aggregations of end-capped fluoroalkyl groups in aqueous and organic media. Fluorinated self-assembled molecular aggregates containing carboxyl and sulfo groups were suggested to interact with positively charged HIV-1 to exhibit a potent anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro. In contrast, fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing cationic segments exhibited not only the unique surface active properties imparted by fluorine as well as the usual low-molecular fluorinated surfactants, but also high surface antibacterial activity. Fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing betaine-type segments were found to cause a gelation where the strong aggregation of the end-capped fluoroalkyl groups is involved in establishing the physical gel network in water and polar organic solvents under non-crosslinked conditions. Similarly, fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing hydroxyl groups could cause a gelation, where the aggregation of fluoroalkyl groups and hydrogen-bonding interaction is involved in establishing a physical gel network in water and polar organic solvents under non-crosslinked conditions. Fluoroalkanoyl peroxide is also a convenient tool for the preparation of new fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers containing recognition moieties such as diacetone segments.

LDHs represent an eco-friendly alternative to conventional catalysts especially for the degradation of noxious emerging contaminants in aqueous solution. They have the ability to host anions in their interlayer structure and the particularity of having a memory effect which facilitates the phenomena of regeneration.

While such compounds have been environmentally present for some time, new pharmaceuticals and replacements for other ECs phased out due to regulatory limitations are continually being introduced to market. Non-target lower organisms are exposed through affected water, atmospheric emissions, precipitation, sediments, among other routes. Biological disruption/dysfunction (such as endocrine, developmental, and epigenetic disruption) has been reported in lower organisms exposed to trace levels of PPCPs and other ECs. Such disruption/dysfunction may not be exclusively present as traditional toxic response (e.g., cancer or death) but may only slightly alter natural biological processes as a result of exposure to an exogenous chemical (e.g., an increased heart rate or altered size of dorsal fat pads in fish). The epigenome and endocrine system appear to be relatively sensitive to many PPCPs/ECs, particularly during early development.Humans are exposed to ECs such as plasticizers and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) mainly through ingestion (food and contaminated liquid) as well as interaction with day-to-day products (detergents, musk compounds in fragrances, etc.). Few, if any, studies have investigated trace-level toxicity of such ECs to humans as direct-exposure trials are highly unethical. However, numerous epidemiological links exist between the presence of contaminants in humans (blood, urine, and tissues) and the occurrence of diseases or other phenotypic alterations. Despite mounting interest and research, such trace-level effects on humans are greatly debated and often criticized.This paper reviews the current understanding of PPCP/EC toxicity. Discussion of general biological disruption/dysfunction of the following seven classes of PPCP/ECs is included: analgesics, antibiotics, antineoplastic compounds, beta-blockers, endocrine disrupting compounds, PFCs, and plasticizers.

Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products.

IgAN is diagnosed from pathological assessment of a renal biopsy specimen based on predominant or codominant IgA-containing immunodeposits, usually with complement C3 co-deposits and with variable presence of IgG and/or IgM. The IgA in these renal deposits is galactose-deficient IgA1, with less than a full complement of galactose residues on the O-glycans in the hinge region of the heavy chains. Research from the past decade led to the definition of IgAN as an autoimmune disease with a multi-hit pathogenetic process with contributing genetic and environmental components. In this process, circulating galactose-deficient IgA1 (autoantigen) is bound by antiglycan IgG or IgA (autoantibodies) to form immune complexes. Some of these circulating complexes deposit in glomeruli, and thereby activate mesangial cells and induce renal injury through cellular proliferation and overproduction of extracellular matrix components and cytokines/chemokines. Glycosylation pathways associated with production of the autoantigen and the unique characteristics of the corresponding autoantibodies in patients with IgAN have been uncovered. Complement likely plays a significant role in the formation and the nephritogenic activities of these complexes. Complement activation is mediated through the alternative and lectin pathways and probably occurs systemically on IgA1-containing circulating immune complexes as well as locally in glomeruli. Incidence of IgAN varies greatly by geographical location; the disease is rare in central Africa but accounts for up to 40% of native-kidney biopsies in eastern Asia. Some of this variation may be explained by genetically determined influences on the pathogenesis of the disease. Genome-wide association studies to date have identified several loci associated with IgAN. Some of these loci are associated with the increased prevalence of IgAN, whereas others, such as deletion of complement factor H-related genes 1 and 3, are protective against the disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and genetic and biochemical factors involved in formation and activities of pathogenic IgA1-containing immune complexes will enable the development of future disease-specific therapies as well as identification of non-invasive disease-specific biomarkers. © 2016 Knoppova, Reily, Maillard, Rizk, Moldoveanu, Mestecky, Raska, Renfrow, Julian and Novak.",asialoglycoprotein receptor; autoantibody; B cell activating factor; complement component C1q; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; epidermal growth factor; galactose; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; interleukin 6; leukemia inhibitory factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; amino acid sequence; anaphylactoid purpura; antigen antibody complex; complement activation; complementarity determining region; electron transport; genetic association; glycosylation; human; immune complex nephritis; immunofluorescence test; immunoglobulin production; immunoglobulin structure; kidney biopsy; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein degradation; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism

Peroxydisulfate (PDS) is widely used as oxidant in soil remediation due to its low cost and long environmental retention time. Experimental parameters and some soil properties significantly impact the contaminant removal rate. Changes in soil geochemistry, biology, and contaminant dynamics occur after application of this technology. The degradation rate of contaminants in soil is generally characterized by a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic model.

Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants.

The current review is focused on emerging pollutants occurring in food or air and include caffeine and nicotine, as well as on pharmaceuticals, in particular amoxicillin, and the concerns caused by its wide usage for medical purposes. This review, for the first time, analyzes and discusses the potential risks and implications of caffeine, nicotine and amoxicillin as emerging environmental pollutants, a field that remains underrepresented to date. Both caffeine and nicotine belong to life style compounds, while pharmaceutical amoxicillin is one of the very popular β-lactam antibiotics used to take care of human and animal infections. The review covers the toxic effect caused by caffeine, nicotine and amoxicillin on humans and animals and describes some of the main adsorbents utilized for their removal (e.g., grape stalk, tea waste, wheat grains, bentonite, activated carbon, acid and base modified grape slurry wastes, graphene oxides, modified graphene oxides, zeolites, etc.). The isotherm and kinetic models for the analysis of caffeine, nicotine and amoxicillin adsorption by different adsorbents are presented.

A mechanical damage to the spinal cord, particularly to its central segment, results in a secondary injury to the nervous tissue (such as ischemia and spinal cord edema). A neurological examination following SCI is primarily aimed at the injury assessment and evaluation on rating scales. The extent of injury is defined by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (modified from the Frankel classification). Neurologists distinguish several characteristic syndromes of partial SCI: the Brown-Sequard syndrome, central cord syndrome, anterior spinal artery syndrome, posterior spinal cord contusion and spinal cord concussion. The incidence of SCI is estimated at 25-35 persons per 1 million population, including 80-85% males. Sixty one percent of the injured parties are between the ages of 16 and 30 years. Nearly one half of SCI cases results from traffic accidents. The most frequently affected segments include the cervical spinal cord (C1-C8) level and the thoracolumbar (ThL) spinal cord.","blunt trauma; disability; expert witness; female; forensic medicine; human; injury scale; male; neurologic examination; pathology; penetrating trauma; review; spinal cord injury; spine injury; standard; Disability Evaluation; Expert Testimony; Female; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Neurologic Examination; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Injuries; Wounds, Nonpenetrating; Wounds, Penetrating"

Octagraphene has an almost strongest sp2 hybrid bond similar to graphene, and has the similar electronic band structure as iron-based superconductors, which makes it possible to realize high-temperature superconductivity. We have compared various possible mechanisms of superconductivity, including the unconventional s± superconductivity driven by spin fluctuation and conventional superconductivity based on electron-phonon coupling. Theoretical studies have shown that octagraphene has relatively high structural stability. Although many 2D carbon materials with C4 carbon ring and C8 carbon ring structures have been reported, it is still challenging to realize the octagraphene with pure square-octagon structure experimentally.

Among them, platinum based cytostatic drugs (Pt CDs) are among the most used drugs in cancer treatments which are administered via intravenous infusion and released partially intact or as transformation products. In this review, the studies on environmental occurrence, transformation, potential ecotoxicity, and possible treatment for the removal of platinum cytostatic compounds are revised. The analysis of the literature highlighted the generally low total platinum concentration values (from a few tens of ng L−1 to a few hundred µg L−1 ) found in hospital effluents. Additionally, several studies highlighted how hospitals are sources of a minor fraction of the total Pt CDs found in the environment due to the slow excretion rate which is longer than the usual treatment durations. Only some data about the impact of the exposure to low levels of Pt CDs on the health of flora and fauna are present in literature. In some cases, adverse effects have been shown to occur in living organisms, even at low concentrations. Further ecotoxicity data are needed to support or exclude their chronic effects on the ecosystem.

Among the catalysts, metal phosphate such as AlPO4 was high in initial activity, but conversion of PFCs decreased in the reaction duration. For the transitional metal modified γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the protective layer of aluminate with spinel structure inhibited the transformation of γ-Al2O3 into inert phases and resulted in better stability than pure γ-Al2O3, but after long time reaction the decrease in catalyst surface acidity resulted in loss in catalytic activity.

The alkynyl derivatives trans-[Rh(CCR)(=C=CHR)(PiPr 3)2] are also accessible from [Rh(η3- CH2Ph)(PiPr3)2] and two equivalents of a terminal alkyne. The reaction of trans-[Rh(R)(=C=CHR′)(PiPr 3)2] and trans-[Rh(Ph)(=C=CMe2)(PiPr 3)2] with CO led to a migration of the alkynyl, aryl, methyl or vinyl group to the α-carbon atom of the vinylidene ligand and gave the η1-vinyl-, η1-butadienyl- and η1-enynylrhodiumcarbonyl complexes trans-[Rh{η1- C(R)=CHR′}(CO)(PiPr3)2] in good to excellent yields. The (Z) isomers are preferentially formed. Even in the absence of CO, the methyl and vinyl compounds trans-[Rh(R)(=C=CHR′)(PiPr3) 2] (R = CH3, CH=CH2) undergo an intramolecular C-C coupling reaction to give the η3-allyl and η3-butadienyl isomers [Rh(η3-1-CH 2CHCHR′)(PiPr3)2] and [Rh(η3-trans-CH2CHC=CHR′)(PiPr3) 2]. Acid-induced cleavage of the Rh-C σ-bond of trans-[Rh{η1-C(R)=CHR′}(CO)(PiPr3)2] with acetic acid affords trans-[Rh(κ1-O2CCH 3)(CO)(PiPr3)2] and the corresponding olefin or diene, respectively. In contrast, the enynyl complexes trans- [Rh{η1-C(CCR)=CHR′}(CO)(PiPr3)2] (R = R′ = Ph, tBu) react with CF3CO2H to give almost exclusively the butatrienes RCH=C=C=CHR′. Treatment of [Rh(η3-1-CH2CHCHR′)(PiPr3) 2] and [Rh(η3-trans-CH2CHC=CHR′) (PiPr3)2] with acid gives [Rh(κ2-O 2CCH3)(PiPr3)2] and the respective olefin or diene.

Moreover, a lower sulphur content of fuels would allow the use of new engines and catalytic systems for the reduction of CO, particle and NOx-emissions, and a more efficient fuel consumption. The S-level in fuels is presently limited in Germany for gasoline and diesel oil to 150 ppm and 350 ppm, respectively. In 2005, the level will be decreased Europe-wide for all vehicle-fuels down to 50 ppm; in some countries, fuels are or will be on the market with even less sulphur. The current technology of hydrodesulphurization (heterogeneous, catalyzed hydrotreating of organic sulphur compounds) can desulphurize quite adequately down to today's S-level. The process, however, is limited for the production of ultra-low sulphur fuels, and the expenses (pressure, reactor size, investment costs, energy consumption, specific active catalysts) are high to meet future requirements. Alternative processes, which are not limited to hydrotreating, are therefore desirable. Beside an overview about hydrotreating, this paper presents two quite different alternatives: Extraction of sulphur compounds by ionic liquids and the synthetic production of S-free fuels from natural gas by Fischer-Tropsch-synthesis. Ionic liquids (ILs) are low melting (<100°C) salts which represent a new class of non-molecular, ionic solvents. In the experiments presented, extraction of model diesel oils (dibenzothiophene and dodecanthiol in n-dodecane) as well as of a real predesulphurized diesel oil (with about 400 ppm S) were investigated. The results show the excellent and selective extraction properties of ILs for organic sulphur compounds, especially with regard to those compounds which are very difficult to remove by common hydrodesulphurization. As expected, the desulphurization by extraction is much more complicated in case of real diesel oil (compared to a model oil) due to its complex chemical composition including many different sulphur compounds and other impurities like organic nitrogen and metal-compounds. Nevertheless, the results with pre-desulphurized diesel oil are also very promising. So, extraction of sulphur components by ILs is a new approach for deep desulphurization of diesel oil. The application of very mild process conditions (low pressure and temperature) in comparison to traditional hydrotreating is an additional advantage of this new concept. An alternative to today's fuels based on crude oil is the production of gasoline and diesel oil from natural gas (or other fossil fuels like coal) by Fischer-Tropsch-synthesis (FTS). The products like diesel oil are completely free of sulphur and other impurities like nitrogen and metal compounds. Although several FTS- processes have been investigated and developed, and some processes are already running on a technical scale, a real breakthrough was not obtained up to now. The production costs of these capital-intensive processes are probably above the breakeven point, at least at today's oil price. In this paper, a 'low-cost' process is discussed, which is based on nitrogen-rich syngas. In contrast to classical FTS-processes with nitrogen-free syngas, the investment costs are probably lower: The syngas is produced by partial oxidation with air, which eliminates the need of an air separation plant, while a process with nitrogen-rich syngas does not utilize a recycle loop and a recycle compressor.",diesel fuel; fuel; gasoline; sulfur; air pollution; desulfurization; environmental protection; exhaust gas; oil industry; petrochemical industry; reaction analysis; review

More than 4000 PFASs have been manufactured by humans and hundreds have been detected in environmental samples. Direct exposures due to use in products can be quickly phased out by shifts in chemical production but exposures driven by PFAS accumulation in the ocean and marine food chains and contamination of groundwater persist over long timescales. Serum concentrations of legacy PFASs in humans are declining globally but total exposures to newer PFASs and precursor compounds have not been well characterized. Human exposures to legacy PFASs from seafood and drinking water are stable or increasing in many regions, suggesting observed declines reflect phase-outs in legacy PFAS use in consumer products. Many regions globally are continuing to discover PFAS contaminated sites from aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) use, particularly next to airports and military bases. Exposures from food packaging and indoor environments are uncertain due to a rapidly changing chemical landscape where legacy PFASs have been replaced by diverse precursors and custom molecules that are difficult to detect. Multiple studies find significant associations between PFAS exposure and adverse immune outcomes in children. Dyslipidemia is the strongest metabolic outcome associated with PFAS exposure. Evidence for cancer is limited to manufacturing locations with extremely high exposures and insufficient data are available to characterize impacts of PFAS exposures on neurodevelopment.

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children’s future health. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Design: Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Results: Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels. Conclusions: Evidence was found to suggest that prenatal exposure to EDCs is positively associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool children. © 2018 The Author(s).","1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; 2,5 dichlorophenol; adiponectin; arsenic; C reactive protein; cadmium; cholesterol; endocrine disruptor; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lead; leptin; mercury; oxybenzone; perfluorooctane; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; triclosan; endocrine disruptor; abdominal circumference; anthropometric parameters; body height; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; diastolic blood pressure; fat mass; female; glucose level; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Review; skinfold thickness; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist to height ratio; cardiovascular disease; child health; metabolic disorder; pregnancy; prevention and control; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

Efforts to immunize in the first weeks of life, in various species, have had limited success in general. This has been attributed to a combination of immaturity of the neonatal immune system and interference by maternal antibodies. Most studies of neonatal immune responsiveness have been carried out in neonatal mice, or by examination of cellular components of human umbilical cord blood. Both approaches have their limitations. The current review describes factors, including corticosteroids, complement proteins, cytokines, maternal lymphocytes and antibodies, which may influence immune responses of neonates, comparing data from studies of domestic animals and humans. Neonates are highly dependent on passive (maternal) antibodies for protection against a wide range of pathogens. These maternal antibodies have been noted to interfere with active immune responses to many, but not all, vaccines. Various theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including epitope masking, clearance of immune complexes and FcγRII mediated regulation of B cells. Remarkably, many studies examining the effects of passive antibodies on immune responses of adults, have demonstrated immune enhancing effects. The evidence for enhancing and suppressive effects of passive antibodies on antigen uptake, processing and regulation of lymphocyte responses is reviewed. Since maternal antibodies (as present in neonates) differ in subisotypes and affinity from the passive antibodies often used in experimental systems, here is a need for better experimental models investigating the effects of bona fide maternal antibodies on immune responses of neonates (not adult surrogates). Vaccines can be optimized for use in neonates - by making better use of existing vaccine technologies and by harnessing the potential of recent immunological and technological advances. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","bovine viral diarrhea vaccine; complement component C3; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; corticosteroid; CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; DNA vaccine; epitope; gamma interferon; glucocorticoid receptor; hydrocortisone; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; live vaccine; maternal antibody; measles vaccine; pertussis vaccine; phosphorothioic acid; retinol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; antibody response; B lymphocyte; Bovine diarrhea virus; bovine viral diarrhea; cellular immunity; colostrum; dendritic cell; domestic animal; erythrocyte; human; hydrocortisone blood level; immune response; immunoregulation; measles; measles vaccination; neonate vaccination; nonhuman; passive immunization; pertussis; priority journal; protein expression; review; T lymphocyte; umbilical cord blood; vaccination; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Animals; Animals, Newborn; B-Lymphocytes; Cytokines; Humans; Immunity, Active; Immunity, Maternally-Acquired; Immunocompetence; Infant, Newborn; Vaccination; Vaccines"

The reactions of TFES with nucleophiles provide a variety of interesting fluoroalkylsulfonic acids and their derivatives, as well as ω-halo-perfluoropentanesulfonyl fluorides. Fluorosulfonyldifluoroacetic acid derivatives such as FSO2CF2COOH, FSO2CF2COOMe, FSO2CF2COOTMS, HCF2SO2R (R=F, OH, OCF2H, OC6H5), ICF2SO2F, and RCF2OCF2CF2SO2F (R=CF2I, CO2Me, CO2Na) are versatile difluoromethylation and/or trifluoromethylation reagents. FSO2CF2COOH, FSO2CF2COOMe, FSO2CF2COOTMS, HCF2SO2R, and ICF2SO2F can effectively incorporate a CF2 group into OH, NH, SH, CC, and CC bonds. HCF2SO2R (R=OH, OCF2H, OC6F5) and FSO2CF2CO2H generate difluorocarbene under acidic conditions, which significantly expanded the scope of the carbene-based difluoromethylation reactions. FSO2CF2CO2Me, FSO2CF2I, and RCF2OCF2CF2SO2F (R=CF2I, CO2Me, CO2Na) are powerful trifluoromethylation reagents, with FSO2CF2CO2Me being world-renowned and widely used in the design of drug candidates and synthesis of novel functional materials. FSO2CF2CO2Me, FSO2CF2I, and RCF2OCF2CF2SO2F are generally produced by nucleophilic substitution, thermal decomposition, or single-electron transfer mechanism in trifluoromethylation reactions under mild conditions.

After plenary presentations, breakout groups were established and tasked to identify and adjudicate via panel discussions overarching conclusions and relevant data gaps. The present review is one in a series and summarizes outcomes of presentations and breakout discussions related to (1) primary sources and pathways in the environment, (2) sorption and transport in porous media, (3) precursor transformation, (4) practical approaches to the assessment of source zones, (5) standard and novel analytical methods with implications for environmental forensics and site management, and (6) classification and grouping from multiple perspectives.

NA,Tying trophic ecology with chemical pollution in California coastal ecosystems:,2021,NA,NA,"Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, expos re effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA’s maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution. ; San Diego State University",NA

Studies have investigated the role of a number of maternal environmental exposures on subsequent allergic disorders in the offspring. We summarize findings from recent studies on prenatal environmental factors influencing IgE levels, atopy, and early asthma. Recent Findings: A building literature supports the influence of maternal exposure to environmental pollutants, such as allergens, traffic-related air pollution, tobacco smoke, and organochlorine compounds and social factors on allergic outcomes. More novel associations have been investigated, such as the effect of prenatal exposures to phthalates, bisphenol A, and magnetic fields. There is also rising interest in epigenetics as a pathway of action by which maternal exposure affect immune health. Summary: Emerging research highlights the challenges of investigating in-utero exposures and of relating exposures to such a heterogeneous and complex outcome as allergic disease. Further research is needed on the mechanisms by which prenatal exposure influences allergic response in childhood and how postnatal, familial and social factors, and sex can modify disease outcomes. Epigenetics is a promising new frontier, and likely one of several explanatory factors.

They are composed of 3-hydroxyacid monomer units and exist as a small number of cytoplasmic granules per cell. The properties of the C4 homopolymer PHB as a biodegradable thermoplastic first attracted industrial attention more than 20 years ago. Copolymers of C4 (3-hydroxybutyrate [3HB] and C5 (3-hydroxyvalerate [3HV]) monomer units have modified physical properties; e.g., the plastic is less brittle than PHB, whereas PHAs containing C8 to C12 monomers behave as elastomers. This family of materials is the centre of considerable commercial interest, and 3HB-co-3HV copolymers have been marketed by ICI plc as Biopol. The known polymers exist as 21 helices with the fiber repeat decreasing from 0.596 nm for PHB to about 0.45 nm for C8 to C10 polymers. Novel copolymers with a backbone of 3HB and 4HB have been obtained. The native granules contain noncrystalline polymer, and water may possibly act as a plasticizer. Although the biosynthesis and regulation of PHB are generally well understood, the corresponding information for the synthesis of long-side-chain PHAs from alkanes, alcohols, and organic acids is still incomplete. The precise mechanisms of action of the polymerizing and depolymerizing enzymes also remain to be established. The structural genes for the three key enzymes of PHB synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A in Alcaligenes eutrophus have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Polymer molecular weights appear to be species specific. The factors influencing the commercial choice of organism, substrate, and isolation process are discussed.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It is widely recognized that a reduction of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells is an immunological hallmark of MS, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In experimental autoimmune models, N-Ras and K-Ras inhibition triggers an anti-inflammatory effect up-regulating, via foxp3 elevation, the numbers and the functional suppressive properties of Tregs. Similarly, an increase in natural Tregs number during Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in R-RAS -/- mice results in attenuated disease. In humans, only KRAS GTPase isoform is involved in mechanism causing tolerance defects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). T cells from these patients have increased transcription of KRAS (but not NRAS). RAS genes are major drivers in human cancers. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing anti-RAS inhibitors for cancer treatment. Despite efforts, no anti-RAS therapy has succeeded in the clinic. The major strategy that has so far reached the clinic aimed to inhibit activated Ras indirectly through blocking its post-translational modification and inducing its mis-localization. The disappointing clinical outcome of Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitors (FTIs) in cancers has decreased interest in these drugs. However, FTIs suppress EAE by downregulation of myelin-reactive activated T-lymphocytes and statins are currently studied in clinical trials for MS. However, no pharmacologic approaches to targeting Ras proteins directly have yet succeeded. The therapeutic strategy to recover immune function through the restoration of impaired Tregs function with the mounting evidences regarding KRAS in autoimmune mediated disorder (MS, SLE, RA, T1D) suggest as working hypothesis the direct targeting KRAS activation using cancer-derived small molecules may be clinically relevant.

DATA SOURCES: Review articles, original reports and abstracts pertaining to endoscopic injection therapy were obtained through a PubMed search of English, German and French publications from 1981 to 2001. DATA SELECTION: A total of 46 studies were selected. Four were selected to support basic concepts in the management of vesicoureteric reflux, and the remainder pertained specifically to endoscopic injection therapy for vesicoureteric reflux. DATA EXTRACTION: The reports were analyzed with focus on the physical properties of the biomaterial injected, results of treatment in regard to the cure of vesicoureteric reflux, duration of cure, and possible adverse effects and clinical benefits engendered by the use of injectable materials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Endoscopic injection therapy successfully cures vesicoureteric reflux in 60% to 80% of cases. Success rates are higher with particulate materials (Teflon and Macroplastique) than with bovine collagen or autologous chondrocytes. Long term data regarding cure are scant. Although concerns about particulate migration and autoimmune disease exist, these have not been borne out of clinical experience. Endoscopic injection may be accomplished on an outpatient basis, with less morbidity than with open ureteroneocystostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic injection therapy should be offered as an alternative treatment in patients with indications to consider ureteroneocystotomy, but should not change the indications for surgical intervention. The ideal biomaterial for injection has yet to be developed, but the field of autologous tissue engineering holds promise for future development.",biomaterial; collagen; collagen implant; politef; autoimmune disease; cartilage cell; child; device; endoscopy; human; morbidity; review; risk benefit analysis; tissue engineering; treatment indication; treatment outcome; ureteroneocystostomy; vesicoureteral reflux

But when using our novel method, in the case of only increasing less computing amounts (&lt;1%), we can obtain conveniently the first order approximation, second order approximation, and so on.

Although the occurrence of these pollutants in wastewater and natural streams has been investigated previously, some recent publications still expose the need to improve the detection strategies and the lack of information about their transformation products. The role of the antibiotic properties and the process operating conditions were also analyzed. The pieces of evidence in the literature associate several molecular properties to the antibiotic removal pathway, like hydrophobicity, chemical structure, and electrostatic interactions. Nonetheless, the influence of operating conditions is still unclear, and solid retention time stands out as a key factor. Additionally, the efficiencies and pathways of antibiotic removals on conventional (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic digestion, and nitrogen removal) and emerging bioprocesses (bioelectrochemical systems, fungi, and enzymes) were assessed, and our concern about potential research gaps was raised. The combination of different bioprocess can efficiently mitigate the impacts generated by these pollutants. Thus, to plan and design a process to remove and mineralize antibiotics from wastewater, all aspects must be addressed, the pollutant and process characteristics and how it is the best way to operate it to reduce the impact of antibiotics in the environment. © 2021 Elsevier LtdThis review approaches the main aspects that influence antibiotic degradation by bioprocesses and assess how those processes affect their removal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Nitrogen removal; Pollution; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge digestion; Wastewater treatment; Antibiotic degradation; Bio-electrochemical systems; Biological wastewater treatment plant; Molecular properties; Potential researches; Process characteristics; Solid retention time; Transformation products; Antibiotics; antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; nitrogen; antiinfective agent; activated sludge; antibiotics; biodegradation; bioreactor; detection method; environmental fate; membrane; metabolite; mineralization; pollution monitoring; wastewater; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water quality; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; antifungal therapy; biodegradation; chemical structure; electrochemical analysis; human; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; protein processing; publication; Review; solids retention time; static electricity; waste water treatment plant; water pollutant; sewage; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

Cephalosporins are the broad-spectrum antibiotics of β-lactam family. Owing to its enormous production and consumption, it is reported as the second most prescribed antibiotic classes in Europe. The cephalosporin wastewater contains toxic organic compounds, inorganic salts, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) which pose a potential threat to the organisms in the environment. Therefore, removal of cephalosporin antibiotics from the environment has become mandatory as it contributes to increase in the level of chemical oxygen demand (COD), causing toxicity of the effluent and production of cephalosporin-resistant microbes. So far, several processes have been reported for degradation/removal of cephalosporins from the environment. A number of individual studies have been published within the last decade covering the various aspects of antibiotics. However, a detailed compilation on cephalosporin antibiotics as an emerging environmental contaminant is still lacking. Hence, the present review intends to highlight the current ecological scenario with respect to distribution, toxicity, degradation, various remediation technologies, and the regulatory aspects concerning cephalosporins. The latest successful technologies for cephalosporin degradation/removal discussed in this review will help researchers for a better understanding of the nature and persistence of cephalosporins in the environment along with the risks associated with their existence. The research thrust discussed in this review will also evoke new technologies to be attempted by the future researchers to develop sustainable options to remediate cephalosporin-contaminated environments. © 2019, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.",antibiotic agent; biological marker; cefazolin; cefdinir; cefepime; ceftiofur; ceftobiprole; ceftriaxone; cefuroxime; cephalosporin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; antimicrobial activity; aquatic environment; bacterium isolate; biodegradation; biotransformation; chemical oxygen demand; commensal Escherichia coli; drug metabolism; electrochemical analysis; genetic variation; human; limit of quantitation; mass spectrometry; microbial community; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; phenotype; photodegradation; photoluminescence; photolysis; prevalence; priority journal; public health; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; toxicity testing; transcriptomics; upregulation; waste water

ChoK is important for the generation of two major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) and subsequently for the cell division. ChoK plays a vital role in cell signaling pathways and regulation of cell growth along with PCho involved in malignant transformation through ras oncogenes in different cancers such as breast, lung, colon, prostate, neuroblastoma, hepatic lymphomas, meningiomas and diverse murine tumours. The Ras effectors serine/threonine kinase (Raf-1), the Ral-GDP dissociation stimulator (Ral-GDS) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are involved in the activation of ChoK during tumorigenesis. ChoK gene induction seems to be associated with certain cell stress or cell defense. Nowadays, RNAi appear to be one of the most promising routes in the cancer therapy. The anticancer potential of both stable expression of siRNAs and their high sequence specificity by RNAi mediated suppression of oncogenic ras in human pancreatic carcinoma, human melanomas and ovarian cancer has been observed. It has an important role in sequence specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism. Presently, the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans choline kinase A-2 (ChoKA-2) is available, which may be useful for comparative modeling of human ChoK and further modeling studies. The present review aims at the general overview of importance, expression, structure, progress in molecular modeling, active site analysis and inhibitors of ChoK.

However, their structural and chemical similarities have proven daunting challenges to incumbent separation technologies, which are energy- and capital-intensive. Approaches capable of discerning and exploiting minute differences in isomeric hydrocarbons, in particular, may provide solutions to this problem. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) integrating the merits of tunable pore size at sub-angstrom scale and pore chemistry in confined spaces have presented promising prospects in adsorptive separation to recognize the minor differences in gas molecules via the judicious design and functionalization. In this Review, we explore the usage of MOFs for the underexplored adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons in the liquid/vapor phase, especially for C6 and C8 isomers. The in-depth insights into the structure-property relationship and the dominant mechanisms, including host-guest interaction modes for the effective adsorption of C6 and C8 hydrocarbons, are systematically discussed. Finally, the effectiveness and scope to translate such design strategies into other systems and the perspective on future development in MOFs for separation are provided. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical industry; Isomers; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organic polymers; Pore size; Separation; Adsorptive separation; Chemical similarity; Confined space; Energy; Gas molecules; Hydrocarbon separation; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Separation technologies; Structural similarity; Tunables; Hydrocarbons

NA,Solution by dilution?-A review on the pollution status of the Yangtze River,2013,NA,NA,"The Yangtze River has been a source of life and prosperity for the Chinese people for centuries and is a habitat for a remarkable variety of aquatic species. But the river suffers from huge amounts of urban sewage, agricultural effluents, and industrial wastewater as well as ship navigation wastes along its course. With respect to the vast amounts of water and sediments discharged by the Yangtze River, it is reasonable to ask whether the pollution problem may be solved by simple dilution. This article reviews the past two decades of published research on organic pollutants in the Yangtze River and several adjacent water bodies connected to the main stream, according to a holistic approach. Organic pollutant levels and potential effects of water and sediments on wildlife and humans, measured in vitro, in vivo, and in situ, were critically reviewed. The contamination with organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and others, of water and sediment along the river was described. Especially Wuhan section and the Yangtze Estuary exhibited stronger pollution than other sections. Bioassays, displaying predominantly the endpoints mutagenicity and endocrine disruption, applied at sediments, drinking water, and surface water indicated a potential health risk in several areas. Aquatic organisms exhibited detectable concentrations of toxic compounds like PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs, and PFCs. Genotoxic effects could also be assessed in situ in fish. To summarize, it can be stated that dilution reduces the ecotoxicological risk in the Yangtze River, but does not eliminate it. Keeping in mind an approximately 14 times greater water discharge compared to the major European river Rhine, the absolute pollution mass transfer of the Yangtze River is of severe concern for the environmental quality of its estuary and the East China Sea. Based on the review, further research needs have been identified. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA

While cholesterol-sensing motifs in transmembrane proteins have been identified, little is known about cholesterol recognition by soluble proteins. We reviewed the structural characteristics of binding sites for cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate from crystallographic structures available in the Protein Data Bank. This analysis unveiled key features of cholesterol-binding sites that are present in either all or the majority of sites: i) the cholesterol molecule is generally positioned between protein domains that have an organized secondary structure; ii) the cholesterol hydroxyl/sulfo group is often partnered by Asn, Gln, and/or Tyr, while the hydrophobic part of cholesterol interacts with Leu, Ile, Val, and/or Phe; iii) cholesterol hydrogen-bonding partners are often found on -helices, while amino acids that interact with cholesterol’s hydrophobic core have a slight preference for -strands and secondary structure-lacking protein areas; iv) the steroid’s C21 and C26 constitute the “hot spots” most often seen for steroid-protein hydrophobic interactions; v) common “cold spots” are C8–C10, C13, and C17, at which contacts with the proteins were not detected. Several common features we identified for soluble protein-steroid interaction appear evolutionarily conserved.—Bukiya, A. N., and A. M. Dopico.

PFAS have been produced in the U.S. since the 1940s and now encompass a growing chemical family comprised of diverse chemical moieties, yet the toxicological effects have been studied for relatively few compounds. Critically, exposures to some PFAS in utero are associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and offspring, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia, and low birth weight. Given the relationship between HDP, placental dysfunction, adverse health outcomes, and increased risk for chronic diseases in adulthood, the role of both developmental and lifelong exposure to PFAS likely contributes to disease risk in complex ways. Here, evidence for the role of some PFAS in disrupted thyroid function, kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome is synthesized with an emphasis on the placenta as a critical yet understudied target of PFAS and programming agent of adult disease. Future research efforts must continue to fill the knowledge gap between placental susceptibility to environmental exposures like PFAS, subsequent perinatal health risks for both mother and child, and latent health effects in adult offspring. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",organofluorine derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl derivative; perfluorohexanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl derivative; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; adult disease; biology; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; kidney disease; low birth weight; maternal hypertension; metabolic syndrome X; physical chemistry; placenta; preeclampsia; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; priority journal; Review; thyroid disease; United States; animal; female; fetomaternal transfusion; maternal exposure; placenta; pollutant; pregnancy; risk assessment; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Placenta; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Risk Assessment

It is difficult to remove 1,4-dioxane by conventional water treatment methods, so its treatment technologies have attracted widespread attentions. In recent years, attentions have been paid to the environmental behavior of 1,4-dioxane and its adverse effects on human health. The remediation technologies of 1,4-dioxane were reviewed in this paper. First, the nature and distribution characteristics of 1,4-dioxane were summarized, and the existing pollution investigation and control standards at home and abroad were compared. Then the development of technologies for controlling 1,4-dioxane pollution in recent years were introduced from three aspects including physical, chemical and biological methods. The removal mechanism, advantages and disadvantages of different methods, and feasibility were also introduced. The inhibitory effect and mechanism of bioremediation methods under the coexistence of chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were pointed out, and the existing methods to deal with mixed pollutants were introduced. Finally, the main directions of future research on 1,4-dioxane pollution treatments were prospected. © 2021, Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.

Many studies so far described declining sperm counts, genital malformations, early puberty onset, highlighting the negative impact on reproduction caused by the exposure to many anthropogenic chemicals. In the last years, increasing evidence suggested that these compounds, other than altering reproduction, affect metabolism and induce the onset of obesity and metabolic disorders. According to the “environmental obesogens” hypothesis, evidence exists that exposure to potential EDCs during critical periods when adipocytes are differentiating, and organs are developing, can induce diseases that manifest later in the life. This review summarizes the effects occurring at the hepatic level in different animal models, describing morphological alterations and changes of molecular pathways elicited by the toxicant exposure. Results currently available demonstrated that these chemicals impair normal metabolic processes via interaction with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including steroid hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoid X receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptors. In addition, novel results revealed that EDC exposure can either affect circadian rhythms as well as up-regulate the expression of signals belonging to the endocannabinoid system, in both cases leading to a remarkable increase of lipid accumulation. These results warrant further research and increase the interest toward the identification of new mechanisms for EDC metabolic alterations. The last part of this review article condenses recent evidences on the ability of potential EDCs to cause “transgenerational effects” by a single prenatal or early life exposure. On this regard, there is compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link developmental environmental insults to adult disease susceptibility. This review will contribute to summarize the mechanisms underlying the insurgence of EDC-induced metabolic alterations as well as to build integrated strategies for their better management. In fact, despite the large number of results obtained so far, there is still a great demand for the development of frameworks that can integrate mechanistic and toxicological/epidemiological observations. This would increase legal and governmental institution awareness on this critical environmental issue responsible for negative consequences in both wild species and human health.

However, there is a large gap in the knowledge about the impact of EDCs on ovarian function, including the process of ovulation. Defects in ovulation are the leading cause of infertility in women, and EDC exposures are contributing to the prevalence of infertility. Thus, investigating the effects of EDCs on the ovary and ovulation is an emerging area for research and is the focus of this review. The effects of EDCs on gametogenesis, uterine function, embryonic development, and other aspects of fertility are not addressed to focus on ovarian- and ovulation-related fertility issues. Herein, findings from epidemiological and basic science studies are summarized for several EDCs, including phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, flame retardants, parabens, and triclosan. Epidemiological literature suggests that exposure is associated with impaired fecundity and in vitro fertilization outcomes (decreased egg yield, pregnancies, and births), while basic science literature reports altered ovarian follicle and corpora lutea numbers, altered hormone levels, and impaired ovulatory processes.

This review article intended to highlight the structural–functional aspect of Fts-Z that leads to Z-ring formation and its contribution to the biochemistry and physiology of cells. The current trend of natural inhibitors of Fts-Z protein is also covered. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA

In recent years they have been detected in various environmental matrix and become the widespread organic pollutants. Based on their ubiquitous distribution, persistence and bioaccumulation, the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances have attracted remarkable attention from related scientists and organizations. The fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) held at the Geneva in May, 2009, has decided to place perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride into Annex B of the convention. From then on, the perfluorinated chemicals as new emerging contaminants, have received great attention, and the research about their environmental problems has come to a new stage of development. This paper reviews the research progress on the analytical method, environmental distribution and behavior, bioaccumulation and biomagnification, human exposure and healthy effect, emerging analogues of PFASs.

CRP belongs to the family of pentraxins and as such consists of five identical non-covalently linked subunits. Contradictory data on the characteristics of CRP as either being pro- or anti-inflammatory may be explained by the existence of two conformations of the protein: the circulating native, pentameric CRP (pCRP) and the monomeric isoform (mCRP), formed as a result of a dissociation process of pCRP. In vitro both isoforms exhibit a very distinct inflammatory profile. We recently identified a localized, physiologically relevant pCRP dissociation mechanism by activated platelets and apoptotic cells and showed the deposition of mCRP in inflamed tissue. Here we review the literature on the causal role of pCRP and mCRP in the light of our findings and critically analyze the current controversies around CRP. The novel understanding of the localized dissociation of circulating pentameric CRP to the distinctively pro-inflammatory monomeric CRP allows for a new view on CRP in inflammatory reactions and further highlights mCRP and the pCRP dissociation process as a potential therapeutic target. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",C reactive protein; CD16 antigen; CD64 antigen; complement component C1q; complement component C2; complement component C3; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; Fc receptor IIa; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; low density lipoprotein; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monomeric c reactive protein; nitric oxide synthase; octapeptide; pentameric c reactive protein; phosphorylcholine; ribonucleoprotein; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; atherosclerosis; blood level; cardiovascular risk; conformational transition; cytokine release; endothelium cell; human; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; ischemia; lipid raft; macrophage; neutrophil; nonhuman; protein binding; protein expression; protein interaction; protein motif; protein structure; protein synthesis; reperfusion injury; review; thrombocyte; thrombocyte activation

The literature on the study of functional activation of PPARalpha by environmental chemicals in relation to their toxicities were reviewed. Environmental chemicals that were found to induce peroxisomes (peroxisome proliferators) and to activate the function of PPARalpha included plasticizers, herbicides, and organic solvents that have carboxyl groups in their parent substances or their metabolites. Several studies have showed species differences in the constitutive expression of PPARalpha and activation of PPARalpha, which may result in species differences in the induction of transcription of the genes encoding several peroxisomal enzymes. Although much information has supported the view that PPARalpha is primarily involved in the hepatic carcinogenicity of peroxisome proliferators, conflicting evidence exists. Most of the peroxisome proliferators have been shown to induce reproductive and developmental disorders, which might, in part. be associated with the functional activation of PPARalpha. Few epidemiological studies on the effect of peroxisome proliferators on humans have been conducted. The effect of perfluorooctanoic acid on humans was evaluated from the aspect of lipid metabolism in one study, which concluded that there was no effect.","carcinogen; cell receptor; herbicide; ligand; plasticizer; solvent; transcription factor; animal; drug effect; female; genetics; human; male; metabolism; mouse; pollutant; rat; review; transactivation; Animals; Carcinogens, Environmental; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Herbicides; Humans; Ligands; Male; Mice; Plasticizers; Rats; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Solvents; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transcription Factors"

The following research gaps should be addressed in future studies: association of contaminants and health in other Arctic regions (i.e. Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Alaska, European North and Russian North); assessment of contaminants on chronic diseases; inclusion of clinical endpoints in assessments; and assessment of the emerging contaminants of perfluorinated compounds and polybrominated diphenyl ethers.BACKGROUND: Since the 1990s, research has been carried out to monitor environmental contaminants and their effects on human health in the Arctic. Although evidence shows that Arctic indigenous peoples are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and do worse on several dimensions of health compared with other populations, the contribution of such exposures on adverse outcomes is unclear.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the published epidemiological literature that has examined association between environmental contaminants and health outcomes in Arctic indigenous populations.DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline (1946-January 2014) using search terms that combined concepts of contaminant and indigenous populations in the Arctic.

Due to their enormous persistence and high mobility, these substances have led to global contamination of the environment and foodstuffs in recent decades. Some PFAS accumulate in humans and—because of their transfer into breast milk—especially in breastfed children. In the last two decades epidemiological studies have provided increasing evidence that effects in humans are also possible in the range of high background exposure. Given the current data situation, a reduced formation of vaccine antibodies is to be regarded as a critical effect in children. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) submitted a new PFAS assessment on 17 September 2020 deriving a tolerable weekly intake for the sum of four compounds. This assessment focused on the accumulation of the compounds during the breastfeeding period and possible effects on the formation of vaccine antibodies in the child. Even though the general PFAS exposure has significantly decreased over the last 30 years, currently approximately 20% of women in Germany are still exposed at such high levels that children breastfed for a long duration can reach the critical PFAS levels in blood derived by the EFSA. In this statement, the National Breastfeeding Committee addresses the balance of benefits and risks of breastfeeding with respect to the exposure of breastfed infants to PFAS. The committee comes to the following conclusions: a reduced formation of vaccine antibodies is to be regarded as undesirable in general. So far, however, there is no convincing scientific evidence that a comparatively high PFAS exposure has a clinical significance in the sense of a reduced effectiveness of vaccinations or an increased susceptibility to infections in children who have been breastfed for a long duration. The possible health risks mentioned are contrasted by numerous consistently observed positive effects of breastfeeding in the child and mother. Weighing up the possible risks of PFAS intake in the breastfed child against the proven benefits of breastfeeding, the National Breastfeeding Committee therefore sees no reason to deviate from the existing breastfeeding recommendation given the current data situation. This applies both to the general population and to people in regions with higher exposure to PFAS. Also, worldwide no scientific body has advised a restriction of breastfeeding to date, in the knowledge of the findings on perfluorinated compounds currently available. © 2021, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",antibody; organic compound; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; breast feeding; disease predisposition; health hazard; human; immune response; Review; risk benefit analysis; vaccination

Tumor progression in vivo is associated with the appearance and selection of tumor cells with new specific characteristics: a high level of H2O2-catabolizing (antioxidant) activity (H2O2CA) and the ability for immediate release of E2-type prostaglandin (PGES) on contact with natural killers, macrophages, and neutrophils; the expression of the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype provides the tumor cells with two mechanisms of local protection against effectors of innate and acquired antitumor immunity. This results in a 10-100-fold less effective rejection of tumor cells in immune and normal animals and corresponding increase of tumorigenicity. The in vitro transformation of normal fibroblasts, spontaneous or induced by oncogenes LTSV40, Ela,b, Haras, myc, and also by p53175 and bcl-2 does not result in the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype expression, but during subsequent in vivo growth of the above-mentioned transformants the selection of tumor cells of the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype is correlated with a 30-200-fold increase in their tumorigenicity (accompanied or not accompanied by spontaneous metastatic activity). Unlike the transformation induced by the above-mentioned oncogenes, the transformation of normal cells by the v-src gene results in the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype expression. The data presented confirm the determining role of the v-src gene in the expression of the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype. In various primary viral carcinogeneses (SV40, SA7(C8)) the natural selection of cells expressing the [H2O2CA + PGES] phenotype begins even within the latent period and can be completed by the appearance of primary tumors.","hydrogen peroxide; prostaglandin E2; animal; cancer transplantation; cell line; disease course; hamster; immunology; metabolism; mouse; neoplasm; oncogene src; pathology; phenotype; physiology; rat; review; signal transduction; Syrian hamster; time; Animals; Cell Line, Transformed; Cricetinae; Dinoprostone; Disease Progression; Genes, src; Hydrogen Peroxide; Mesocricetus; Mice; Neoplasm Transplantation; Neoplasms; Phenotype; Rats; Signal Transduction; Time Factors"

To overcome this issue, adsorption is viewed as one of the most encouraging innovations for the removal of pollutants. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered to be efficiently adsorbent, because of their porosity, high surface area, fine-Tunable metal clusters, and easy functional surface engineering properties.

Analytical chemistry plays an essential role in the measurement of POPs and provides important information on their distribution and environmental transformations. Much effort has been devoted during the last two decades to the development of faster, safer, more reliable and more sensitive analytical techniques for these pollutants. Since the Stockholm Convention (SC) on POPs was adopted 12 years ago, analytical methods have been extensively developed. This review article introduces recent analytical techniques and applications for the determination of POPs in environmental and biota samples, and summarizes the extraction, separation and instrumental analyses of the halogenated POPs. Also, this review covers important aspects for the analyses of SC POPs (e.g. lipid determination and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC)), and finally discusses future trends for improving the POPs analyses and for potential new POPs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Instrumental analysis; Liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Sample preparation; Biology; Gas chromatography; Organic pollutants; hexabromocyclododecane; organochlorine pesticide; organofluorine derivative; perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; unclassified drug; analytic method; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); gas chromatography; intermethod comparison; lipid analysis; liquid liquid extraction; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant; pollution monitoring; priority journal; review; sampling; separation technique; solid phase extraction

In particular, in all vanadium flow battery systems (VRB), perfluorinated polymers such as Nafion® are widely used, owing to their high proton conductivity and chemical stability; however, the extremely high cost of currently available membranes has limited the commercialization of VRB technology. Recently, low-cost porous polymeric composite separators (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]/silica), as an alternative to traditional ion-exchange membranes, have attracted a great deal of interest because of their significantly lower cost. Porous separators prepared from various polymer materials and inorganic fillers have demonstrated comparable electrochemical performances to that of Nafion® in flow battery tests with different redox chemistries. This paper provides a review of porous separators for flow battery applications. In addition to discussions of separator material selection and preparation methods, we also emphasize the electrochemical performance of various flow battery systems, especially the capacity fade mechanism that is closely related to ion-transport across porous separator. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Chemical stability; Composite membranes; Costs; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Ions; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Pressure regulation; Reinforced plastics; Separators; Vanadium; Battery applications; Capacity fade; Electrochemical performance; Inorganic fillers; Perfluorinated polymers; Polymeric composites; Preparation method; Separator material; Flow batteries

Although the obesity epidemic is largely fueled by poor nutrition and lack of exercise, certain chemicals have been shown to potentially have a role in its aetiology. A substantial body of evidence suggests that a subclass of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which interfere with endocrine signalling, can disrupt hormonally regulated metabolic processes, especially if exposure occurs during early development. These chemicals, so-called 'obesogens' might predispose some individuals to gain weight despite their efforts to limit caloric intake and increase levels of physical activity.

NA,Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and their effects during female puberty: A review of current evidence,2020,NA,NA,"Puberty is the process of physical changes between childhood and adulthood during which adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction. It is considered one of the main temporal windows of susceptibility for the influence of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs may act as single chemical agents or as chemical mixtures; they can be pubertal influencers, accelerating and anticipating the processing of maturation of secondary sexual characteristics. Moreover, recent studies have started to point out how exposure to EDCs during puberty may predispose to breast cancer later in life. In fact, the estrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors (EEDs) may influence breast tissue development during puberty in two main ways: the first is the action on the proliferation of the breast stromal cells, the second concerns epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this mini-review was to better highlight what is new and what is not completely known regarding the role of EDCs during puberty. © 2020 by the authors.

Dysfunction of these circuits that results in a persistent or inhibited glucocorticoid secretion can severely affect processing of stressful experiences and lead to risk for developing further psychiatric pathology. Exposure to toxic chemicals found in our environment, including pesticides, metals, and industrial compounds, have been shown to have significant impact on neurological health and disease. Indeed, studies have begun to identify the HPA axis and limbic system as potential targets of many of these environmental chemicals, suggesting a possible environmental risk for damage to the stress circuit and response to stressful stimuli. This review will focus on our current understanding of the impact exposure to environmental toxicants, including bisphenol A and lead, has on the synaptic physiology of the HPA axis and limbic system and how this contributes to an alteration in behavior output.

In 1998, epoetin-associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was first reported and causation was attributed to formulations without human serum albumin (HSA), subcutaneous administration, and uncoated rubber stoppers. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on erythropoietin (EPO)-associated PRCA were obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulatory authorities in other countries, and the manufacturers of epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, and darbepoetin. The data included information on numbers of PRCA cases and estimated exposure-adjusted incidence rates by EPO product, anemia etiology, administration route, country of PRCA identification, and date reported. RESULTS: In 1999, academicians in Paris identified 12 EPO-treated patients with antibody-mediated PRCA; 11 of these patients were on hemodialysis and had received subcutaneous Eprex (Johnson & Johnson). In 2002, authorities in Europe, Australia, Singapore, and Canada mandated Eprex by IV route to hemodialysis patients, and the relevant manufacturers added Teflon coating to prefilled syringes of Eprex; PRCA cases subsequently decreased by 90 percent. By 2003, 180 Eprex-associated PRCA cases were identified in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Asia, despite improvements in handling. Since 2002, FDA safety databases include information on 59 new cases of antibody-associated PRCA, primarily associated with subcutaneous epoetin alfa and darbepoetin that does not contain HSA. CONCLUSION: Independent actions by regulatory authorities, manufacturers, and academic researchers identified significant numbers of PRCA cases between 1998 and 2003 and characterized the probable etiology. Today, antibody-mediated PRCA is an infrequent class toxicity occurring among some hemodialysis patients on EPOs. © 2008 American Association of Blood Banks.","corticosteroid derivative; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; interferon; novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein; politef; polysorbate 80; prednisone; recombinant erythropoietin; ribavirin; rituximab; tacrolimus; anemia; Asia; Australia; Canada; chronic kidney disease; clinical trial; drug withdrawal; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Europe; food and drug administration; France; hemodialysis; hepatitis C; human; medical information; morbidity; nonhuman; outcome assessment; pure red cell anemia; radioimmunoassay; review; risk assessment; Singapore; Anemia; Drug Labeling; Drug Toxicity; Epoetin Alfa; Hematinics; Humans; Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure"

Identification of stressors and improved understanding of how scavenging reactions proceed are essential for accelerated development of new fuel cell membrane materials with antioxidant properties and enhanced durability. Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of a fuel such as hydrogen into electricity and heat and have the potential to deliver environmental and economic benefits across various sectors, including transportation, power generation, industrial equipment, military power, and consumer electronics. The development of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) membranes with increased durability is of crucial importance since it directly impacts fuel cell system lifetime and, therefore, large scale implementation of fuel cell technology. The PFSA proton conducting polymer (ionomer) at the heart of the membrane electrode assembly of a PEMFC is subject to chemical degradation as a result of the attack on the polymer chains by reactive oxygen species generated electrochemically in the fuel cell. For the first time, this article reviews the literature both on mechanisms by which this chemical degradation of the ionomer membrane occurs and the sites on the polymer susceptible to free radical attack, as well as how this learning and increased understanding have been used to build and develop successful mitigation strategies designed to annihilate the harmful effect of oxidative species on membrane integrity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Chemical attack; Chemical equipment; Conducting polymers; Degradation; Durability; Free radicals; Ionomers; Membranes; Antioxidant properties; Fuel cell technologies; Membrane electrode assemblies; Perfluorosulfonic acid; Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes; Proton-conducting polymers; Reactive oxygen species; Scavenging reactions; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); antioxidant; chemical method; degradation; fuel cell; identification method; literature review; longevity; membrane; polymer; reactive oxygen species

As expected according to this hypothesis, genes for late-acting components (C3, C5, C7 and C8 in man, C5 in mice) have so far not proved to be linked to HLA. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.","complement; chromosome 6; complement activation; gene linkage group; gene location; HLA system; immune response; immunity; in vitro study; major histocompatibility complex; normal human; Animal; Antibody Formation; Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X; Complement; Complement 2; Complement 3; Complement 4; Enzyme Activation; Evolution; Genes; Histocompatibility Antigens; HLA Antigens; Human; Linkage (Genetics); Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed; Mice; Properdin; Virus Diseases"

Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Alkalinity; Hydrophobicity; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Pore size; Surface chemistry; Adsorption performance; Adverse effect; Aliphatic compound; Health and environment; Human environment; Human health; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Activated carbon; charcoal; fluorocarbon; metal organic framework; adsorption; human; water pollutant; Adsorption; Charcoal; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Heavier than water intraocular tamponades have been developed to improve inferior tamponading properties. In addition to inferior PVR, there seem to be other applications such as persistent macular holes or PVR in trauma eyes. Materials and methods: Review of the literature on clinical application of heavy tamponades. The review also discusses the theoretical background of heavy tamponades and possible future developments. Results: The parameters of an optimal intraocular tamponade are defined, and the influences of the specific gravity, buoyancy, interfacial tension, and viscosity are discussed. Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially fluorinated alkanes were associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rise in intraocular pressure that was less prominent in admixtures of these substances with silicone oil (heavy silicone oils). Two recently developed heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are well-tolerated and have entered clinical practice. The side effects are associated with the chemical properties of the tamponading agent, and seem comparable to the ones seen with conventional silicone oil. Conclusion: Heavy silicone oil tamponade improves inferior tamponade, and may be considered a new generation of intraocular tamponades. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; silicone oil; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; emulsion; eye inflammation; human; interface pressure; intraocular hypertension; physical chemistry; priority journal; relative density; retina detachment; retina disease; retina macula hole; retina tear; review; viscosity; vitreoretinopathy; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Retinal Diseases; Silicone Oils; Specific Gravity; Surface Tension; Viscosity

Data source: A thorough, computerized bibliographic search of the preclinical and clinical literature regarding the properties of helium and its application in pediatric respiratory disease states. Data synthesis: After an overview of the potential benefits and technical aspects of helium- oxygen gas mixtures, the role of heliox is addressed for asthma, aerosolized medication delivery, upper airway obstruction, postextubation stridor, croup, bronchiolitis, and high-frequency ventilation. The available data are objectively classified based on the value of the therapy or intervention as determined by the study design from which the data are obtained. Conclusions: Heliox administration is most effective during conditions involving density-dependent increases in airway resistance, especially when used early in an acute disease process. Any beneficial effect of heliox should become evident in a relatively short period of time. The medical literature supports the use of heliox to relieve respiratory distress, decrease the work of breathing, and improve gas exchange. No adverse effects of heliox have been reported.

Trophic magnification factor and BMF values greater than 1.0 are often considered to be the most conclusive indicators of B status, and the TMF criterion has been referred to as the ""gold standard"" for B categorization. Although not wishing to dispute the theoretical primacy of field-derived BMFs and TMFs as B metrics, we make the case that, in practice, the study-to-study (and even within-study) variability of the results is so great that they are of very restricted usefulness for assessing B status, at least in the case of the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), on which we focus here. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the results of 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting field-derived BMFs or TMFs for 14 PFASs, for which BMF values often range over several orders of magnitude from ≪1.0 to ≫1.0, sometimes even in the same study. For TMFs, the range is a factor of approximately 20 for the most intensely studied PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS]). We analyze the possible causes for such variability: To some extent it results from the differing ways in which the metrics are expressed, but most of the scatter is likely attributable to such factors as nonachievement of the tacitly assumed steady-state conditions, uncertainties in the feeding ecology, the impact of metabolism of precursor compounds, and so forth. As more trustworthy alternatives to field-derived BMFs and TMFs, we suggest the implementation of dietary BMF studies performed under strictly controlled conditions on aquatic, terrestrial, and avian species, as well as the consideration of measured elimination half-lives, which have been demonstrated to be directly related to BMF values. © 2015 The Author.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water pollutant; analysis; animal; environmental monitoring; food chain; procedures; risk assessment; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Caprylates; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Food Chain; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Most natural manganese oxides are produced through the Mn(II) oxidation process driven by microbes. Biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) are usually amorphous and rich in defects and possess large surface areas, resulting in high oxidative reactivity and strong absorption capacity for many emerging pollutants. Up to date, numerous of Mn(II) oxidation microbes (MnOM) have been isolated and characterized. Both directly enzymatic or indirectly abiotic Mn(II) oxidation processes were found in MnOM, but a systemic summarization about the Mn(II) oxidation mechanism is still lack. Moreover, the differentiation among BioMnOx produced by different MnOM needs to compare. As a potential oxidant and catalyst for pollutants removal, the role of BioMnOx in environmental remediation is also rarely mentioned. In this review, we focus on the Mn(II) oxidation process mediated by different MnOM, including their Mn(II) oxidation characterization and putative mechanism, as well as characterization of BioMnOx, and BioMnOx-related environmental remediation processes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",NA

They have been detected worldwide in environmental matrices, indicating their ineffective removal from water and wastewater using conventional treatment methods. To prevent this contamination, several processes to degrade/remove antibiotics have been studied. This review addresses the current state of knowledge concerning the input sources, occurrence and mainly the degradation and removal processes applied to a specific class of micropollutants, the antibiotics. In this paper, different remediation techniques were evaluated and compared, such as conventional techniques (biological processes, filtration, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), adsorption, membrane processes and combined methods. In this study, it was found that ozonation, Fenton/photo-Fenton and semiconductor photocatalysis were the most tested methodologies. Combined processes seem to be the best solution for the treatment of effluents containing antibiotics, especially those using renewable energy and by-products materials. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","aminoglycoside; anthracycline; antibiotic agent; beta lactam antibiotic; carbapenem derivative; cephalosporin derivative; chloramphenicol; glycopeptide; imidazole derivative; lincosamide; macrolide; mitomycin; penicillin derivative; polyether antibiotic agent; polypeptide antibiotic agent; quinolone derivative; quinoxaline derivative; sulfonamide; tetracycline; trimethoprim; adsorption; antibiotics; aquatic ecosystem; aqueous solution; coagulation; degradation; flocculation; literature review; membrane; oxidation; ozone; photochemistry; pollutant removal; wastewater; adsorption; aquatic environment; comparative study; ecosystem restoration; Fenton reaction; filtration; flocculation; oxidation; ozonation; photocatalysis; review; sedimentation; water contamination; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Humans; Refuse Disposal; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Water Purification"

Furthermore, the reactivity of persulfates is extremely dependent on the related activation techniques and the composition of the treated water matrix. Direct reactions of peroxydisulfate (PDS) or peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are rather slow and mostly unsuitable for pollutant degradation. However, PDS or PMS decompose at elevated temperatures under UV radiation, and radiolysis treatment as well as in presence of reduced metal ions to form sulfate radicals (SO4[rad]−). (SO4[rad]−)-based oxidation can also form secondary oxidants for instance carbonate radicals, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals or singlet oxygen which can influence both transformation efficiency and product formation. The formation of such species is extremely subjected on the water matrix composition and can hardly be predicted. One important aspect in dealing with PDS or PMS is their analysis, which is often prone for interference by other matrix components and hampered by the low stability of PDS and PMS in aqueous systems. Numerous methods for analysis of PDS and PMS are available.

Recently, highly active oxidation methods for the efficient degradation of PFOX were developed through the promotion effect of various physical processes on the oxidation ability of conventional chemical methods. So this paper reviews the concerned reports which employed the single chemical oxidation approach and the coupling techniques of physical processes and chemical oxidation for the removal of PFOX. The coupling effects of physical methods and chemical oxidation processes can result in photolysis, electrolysis, pyrolysis, sonolysis, plasma-induced oxidation, microwave-induced oxidation, or mechanochemistry destruction of PFOX. For each coupling physicochemical techniques, the mechanism of the oxidative reaction, the detailed degradation pathway of PFOX, the effect of various influential factors on reaction process as well as the removal efficiency and energy consumption are summarized in this paper.

For achieving such synthetic functionalities, different approaches have been conceived, such as the indirect fluoroalkylation reactions of sulfides and selenides. More recently, the direct-one-pot incorporation of these groups (i.e.: RFS- and RFSe-) has allowed for the late-stage functionalization of biological relevant substrates, which permits achieving synthetic protocols in the presence of other sensitive functional groups.

Recent technical and conceptual breakthroughs in bacterial cell biology, combined with the flood of genome sequence information and the excellent genetic tools in several model systems, have shed new light on the mechanism of prokaryotic cell division. There is good evidence that in most species, a molecular machine, organized by the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, assembles at the site of division and orchestrates the splitting of the cell. The determinants that target the machine to the right place at the right time are beginning to be understood in the model systems, but it is still a mystery how the machine actually generates the constrictive force necessary for cytokinesis. Moreover, although some cell division determinants such as FtsZ are present in a broad spectrum of prokaryotic species, the lack of FtsZ in some species and different profiles of cell division proteins in different families suggests that there are diverse mechanisms for regulating cell division.

In this review we present evidence that environmental chemicals, particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead, are associated with defcits in many neurobehavioral functions that are also impaired in ADHD. Datas Ources: Human and animal studies of developmental PCB or lead exposures that assessed specifc functional domains shown to be impaired in ADHD children were identifed via searches of PubMed using ""lead"" or ""PCB exposure"" in combination with key words, including ""attention,"" ""working memory,"" ""response inhibition,"" ""executive function,"" ""cognitive function,"" ""behavior,"" and ""ADHD."" Datasynthesis: Children and laboratory animals exposed to lead or PCBs show defcits in many aspects of attention and executive function that have been shown to be impaired in children diagnosed with ADHD, including tests of working memory, response inhibition, vigilance, and alertness. Studies conducted to date suggest that lead may reduce both attention and response inhibition, whereas PCBs may impair response inhibition to a greater degree than attention. Low-level lead exposure has been associated with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD in several recent studies. Similar studies of PCBs have not been conducted. Conclusions: We speculate that exposures to environmental contaminants, including lead and PCBs, may increase the prevalence of ADHD.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aroclor; chlorpyrifos; lead; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid derivative; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; alertness; amnesia; attention; attention deficit disorder; behavior; behavior disorder; brain function; cognition; cognitive defect; disease model; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epidemiological data; human; neurochemistry; neurologic disease; nonhuman; priority journal; review; risk factor; working memory; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Lead; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Risk Factors; Animalia"

The injection port derivatization (IPD), on-line derivatization in nature, occurs in the high-temperature GC injection port. It is demonstrated to be superior to the off-line derivatization with its simplicity, high reaction efficiency and less consumption of potential poisonous reagents. To further encourage applications of this technology, developments in IPD are well highlighted in the present review. The primary types of derivatization reactions involved in IPD are based on silylation, alkylation and acylation. The parameters influential to IPD reactions, such as injection port temperature, purge off time and the amount of derivatization reagents, are elaborated.

PFAS most commonly occur as mixtures and only rarely, if ever, as single environmental contaminants. This poses significant regulatory questions and a pronounced need for chemical risk assessments, analytical methods, and technological solutions to reduce the risk to public and environmental health. The effects of PFAS on biological systems may be complex. Each may have several molecular targets initiating multiple biochemical events leading to a number of different adverse outcomes. An exposure to mixtures or coexposures of PFAS complicates the picture further. This review illustrates how PFAS target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Additionally, we describe how such activation leads to changes in cell differentiation and bone development that contributes to metabolic disorder and bone weakness.

In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides.

In all cases of acute respiratory failure, there is a shortage of surfactant at the alveolar level. This deficit of surfactant leads to an increase in alveolar surface tension that increases the retraction forces of the lung, leading to end-expiratory alveolar collapse, finally resulting in respiratory dysfunction, which includes hypoxemia, low lung compliance, increase of intrapulmonary shunts, low functional residual capacity, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The goal of the treatment and prevention of acute respiratory failure is therefore based on the following three main items: re-opening the collapsed alveolar units; preserving the active surfactant component in the remaining functional alveolar units, and preventing end-expiratory collapse. The following strategies can be used to prevent and/or treat acute respiratory failure: counterbalancing the retraction forces of the lung by applying sufficiently high external pressures; and/or decreasing the surface tension at the air-liquid interface by means of exogenous surfactant, and/or eliminating the air-liquid interface by filling the lung with perfluorocarbons. By applying these therapeutic strategies in routine clinical practice, we should achieve a reduction in the mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure.

International consensus recommends the use of statins as the first line of treatment for patients with this condition. However, homozygote FH patients with persistently elevated LDL-C levels are usually resistant to multiple-drug therapy. Fortunately, LDL apheresis (or simply 'lipoprotein apheresis') provides a treatment option for patients who are refractory or intolerant to lipid-lowering medications, or if there is progressive cardiovascular disease despite maximal drug therapy.Lipoprotein apheresis is an extracorporeal LDL-C-lowering treatment similar in concept to renal dialysis. There are now five main methods for extracorporeal lipoprotein apheresis in use, namely dextran sulfate adsorption (DSA), heparin extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP), polyacrylate full blood adsorption (PFBA or DALI® system) using hemoperfusion, immunoadsorption, and filtration plasmapheresis.Lipoprotein apheresis has been shown to be successful in reducing LDL-C levels, as well as levels of lipoprotein(a) Lp(a), a prothrombotic proatherogenic lipoprotein. In contrast, however, lipoprotein apheresis seems to have a smaller effect in preventing atherosclerosis progression, thus suggesting that a major component of the reduction in cardiovascular events may be mediated by mitigating Lp(a) levels. Side effects are infrequent and mild, and have mainly consisted of lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. As these are often bradykinin-mediated and associated with concomitant ACE inhibitor use, angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonists should be used instead of ACE inhibitors with DALI and PFBA. Nevertheless, there is scope for wider application of lipoprotein apheresis.The high cost and invasive nature of lipoprotein apheresis limits uptake; however, it is an important treatment modality that should be considered in carefully selected patients. National and international registries compiling outcome data for lipoprotein apheresis need to be established to help expand the evidence base regarding its effectiveness. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

Similar to the vast majority of antibiotics, drugs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are directed against microbial targets. Although more effective drugs that target the bacterium may lead to faster cure of patients, it is possible that a biological limit will be reached that can be overcome only by adopting a fundamentally new treatment approach. TB regimens might be improved by including agents that target host pathways. Recent work on host-pathogen interactions, host immunity, and host-directed interventions suggests that supplementing anti-TB therapy with host modulators may lead to shorter treatment times, a reduction in lung damage caused by the disease, and a lower risk of relapse or reinfection. We undertook this review to identify molecular pathways of the host that may be amenable to modulation by small molecules for the treatment of TB. Although several approaches to augmenting standard TB treatment have been proposed, only a few have been explored in detail or advanced to preclinical and clinical studies.

Most often, laboratory trials are conducted to assess the removal efficiency of ARB and ARGs in individual treatment processes (e.g., disinfection). However, the random variations of microbial distribution and chemical compositions in real-world environments cannot be entirely simulated, presumably leading to false-positive results as a consequence. It is therefore useful to provide a summary of recent advancements regarding the antibiotic resistance attenuation during full-scale water/wastewater treatments, which has not been adequately evaluated so far.

Attention has mostly been focused on T-cell-mediated cellular mechanisms of allograft rejection to explain these losses; however, as in other forms of solid-organ transplantation, especially kidney and heart, antibody-mediated mechanisms of acute and chronic allograft injury are increasingly being implicated. In this review, the mechanisms of B-cell- and humoral-mediated allograft injury will be briefly discussed along with the limited evidence that exist for invoking antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) as important in intestine transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: The presence of donor-specific antibody has been reported to increase the incidence and severity of intestine allograft rejection and to worsen the overall prognosis for graft and patient. C4d staining in intestine biopsies is unreliable, and currently it is not possible to diagnose AMR with certainty in intestine transplantation. Treatment of presumed AMR in intestine recipients is purely anecdotal at this time.

Retrospective study of 184 patients with cervicobrachialgia who underwent cervical MRI and EMG. The variables analyzed were gender, age, elements of spondylosis (osteophytes, arthropathy, spondylolisthesis and canal stenosis), the type of disc disease (protrusion and herniated disc) and curvature in the sagittal plane. The EMG was used to evaluate the neurogenic findings in the muscles dependent on the spinal roots of C4 to C8-T1. Average age was 53.65±11.96 years. The patients were evaluated for the presence of osteophytes (n = 111), arthropathy (n = 76), spondylolisthesis (n = 15) and stenosis of the spinal canal (n = 35). The highest incidences were osteophytes in C5-C6 (n=108), protrusions in C5-C6 (n=58), herniated disc in C5-C6 (n=18) and neurogenic findings in C7 (n=130). The rectification of cervical lordosis appeared in 124 patients. Spondylosis increases with age. Disc herniations, disc protrusions and motor radiculopathy are more frequent in the 5th to 6th years of life. In patients with cervicobrachialgia, the sagittal rectification is more common than the normal lordosis. © 2020 Sociedad Anatomica Espanola.

The properties that made PFAS into an industrial success also led to their persistence and bioaccumulation. As PFAS were widely used for many decades their presence is evident globally, and their persistence and potential for toxicity create concern for human, animal and environmental health. Following the precautionary principle, a reduction in human exposure is generally recommended. The most significant source of human exposure to PFAS is dietary intake (food and water) with additional exposure via dust. As PFAS concentrations have been more frequently studied in aquatic food sources, there is less understanding of exposure via terrestrial animals. To further define human exposure via animal products, it is necessary to determine PFAS concentrations and persistence in terrestrial livestock and game species. Studies assessing ambient concentrations of PFAS have noted that, aside from point sources of contamination, there is generally low input of PFAS into terrestrial agricultural food chains. However, livestock and game species may be exposed to PFAS via contaminated water, soil, substrate, air or food, and the contribution of these exposures to PFAS concentrations in food products is less well studied. This review focuses on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAAs) and compiles information from terrestrial livestock and game species as a source of dietary exposure in humans, and discusses toxicokinetics and health effects in animals, while identifying future focus areas. Publications describing the transfer of PFAAs to farmed and hunted animals are scarce, and demonstrate large variability in distribution and elimination. We outline several relatively small, short-term studies in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. While negative effects have not been noted, the poultry investigations were the only studies to explicitly assess health effects. Comparative information is presented on PFAA concentrations in livestock products and edible tissues of game animals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural robots; Biochemistry; Food microbiology; Food products; Mammals; Organic chemicals; Soil pollution; Water pollution; Agricultural foods; Ambient concentrations; Contaminated water; Environmental health; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Precautionary principle; Terrestrial animals; Agriculture; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; water; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); food safety; gamebird; livestock; persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; toxicology; air pollution; bioaccumulation; blood; concentration (parameter); dietary exposure; dietary intake; domestic pig; egg; elimination reaction; environmental health; fish meat; food chain; food contamination; food safety; game animal; game bird; human; kidney tissue; liver tissue; livestock; milk; muscle tissue; nonhuman; pasture; placental transfer; poultry; progeny; Review; sheep; soil pollution; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; water contamination; animal; bovine; livestock; pig; water pollution; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Cattle; Dietary Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Livestock; Sheep; Swine; Water Pollution
NA,Environmental occurrence and remediation of emerging organohalides: A review,2021,NA,NA,"As replacements for “old” organohalides, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), “new” organohalides have been developed, including decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), and perfluorobutyrate (PFBA). In the past decade, these emerging organohalides (EOHs) have been extensively produced as industrial and consumer products, resulting in their widespread environmental distribution. This review comprehensively summarizes the environmental occurrence and remediation methods for typical EOHs. Based on the data collected from 2015 to 2021, these EOHs are widespread in both abiotic (e.g., dust, air, soil, sediment, and water) and biotic (e.g., bird, fish, and human serum) matrices. A significant positive correlation was found between the estimated annual production amounts of EOHs and their environmental contamination levels, suggesting the prohibition of both production and usage of EOHs as a critical pollution-source control strategy. The strengths and weaknesses, as well as the future prospects of up-to-date remediation techniques, such as photodegradation, chemical oxidation, and biodegradation, are critically discussed. Of these remediation techniques, microbial reductive dehalogenation represents a promising in situ remediation method for removal of EOHs, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA

Further efforts were then directed toward evaluating the effectiveness of educational campaigns focused on increasing PFD usage and general boating safety. Highly significant increases were found in the use of life preservers overall and within various subgroups of the population. Total PFD use increased from 19.8% in 1992 to 31.3% in 1994.

In Western countries, health advisories regarding PFAS exposure have been released to warn the public of its potential adverse effects. However, awareness regarding PFAS exposure in Asia is still at its infancy as reflected by the minimal safeguards imposed to protect the population from exposure. Here, we reviewed studies on PFAS contamination in Asia with a focus on freshwater resources to determine whether PFAS is also a concern in this part of the globe. Peer reviewed articles which included information on PFAS levels from 2000 to 2020 were compiled. The highest PFAS contamination was detected in surface water relative to ground, tap, and drinking water. PFAS levels in water resources in several countries in Asia, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, were above the recommended level, similar to that in the United States. PFAS in South and Southeast Asia were just below the recommended level, but the rise of PFAS in China in the recent decade, alongside its remarkable economic and industrial growth, suggests that increased PFAS contamination in South and Southeast Asia may soon follow, as these countries compete with the global economy. Hence, there is a need for these countries to also implement measures that will reduce the exposure of their population to PFAS. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; fresh water; ground water; perfluoro compound; surface water; tap water; drinking water; fluorocarbon; fresh water; bioaccumulation; chemical pollutant; drinking water; economic growth; global economy; literature review; persistence; surface water; water resource; Asia; China; Japan; priority journal; Review; South Asia; South Korea; Southeast Asia; United States; water availability; water contamination; water supply; Asia; human; water pollutant; China; Japan; South Korea; United States; Asia; China; Drinking Water; Fluorocarbons; Fresh Water; Humans; Japan; Republic of Korea; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

As the number of diabetic patients increases, the demand for production of antidiabetic drugs also increases. This, in turn, raises environmental concerns since these drugs eventually reach water bodies through various means like, excretory wastes by the patients. It is urgent to make the appropriate legislation to control and regulate the flow of hypoglycemic pharmaceuticals such as metformin into natural lakes and drinking water reservoirs before undesirable and irreversible changes occur in these waterbodies. The use of metformin leads to the environmental release of this drug into the waterbodies. Mexico is one of the nations with the highest number of obese patients and the quantity of metformin administered per patient can be up 2500 mg/day. There are also other products such as alphaglucosidase inhibitors thiazolidinediones, and meglitinides that have the potential to reach aquatic ecosystems. Information related to their concentrations in natural waters, their metabolites or effects on nontarget organisms is scarce. Most studies on the effects of metformin on aquatic organisms have been on fish, algae, and bacteria while zooplankton have received much less attention. This is surprising since zooplankton species are the principal link between phytoplankton and fish larvae and are more sensitive to stress than algae. Flocculation, activated carbon filtration, ozonisation, and chlorination are ineffective in removing metformin and guanylurea. Therefore, other means of waste disposal of unused antidiabetic drugs must be pursued than treating wastewaters containing them. Metformin and guanylurea are highly water soluble and the available information on the adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs is scarce and restricted to a few groups of aquatic organisms. It is therefore urgently needed to generate appropriate legislation to control and regulate the flow of orally administered pharmaceuticals such as metformin into natural lakes and drinking water reservoirs before undesirable and rreversible changes occur in these waterbodies. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",activated carbon; aquatic organism; chemical pollutant; chlorination; diabetes; drinking water; drug; freshwater ecosystem; hormone; lake water; phytoplankton; pollutant removal; reservoir; waste disposal; wastewater treatment; zooplankton; Mexico [North America]; algae

A wider range of geographical locations (e.g., South America, Russia, Antarctica) and habitats (e.g., high-mountain lakes, deep-ocean, and offshore waters) have been investigated in recent years enabling a better understanding of the global distribution of PFCs in aquatic organisms. High concentrations of PFCs continue to be detected in invertebrates, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is still the predominant PFC detected (mean concentrations up to 1900 ng/g ww) in addition to important concentrations of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; sum PFCAs up to 400 ng/g ww). More studies have evaluated the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these compounds in both freshwater and marine food webs. Several reports have indicated a decrease in PFOS levels over time in contrast to PFCA concentrations that have tended to increase in tissues of aquatic organisms at many locations. The detection of precursor metabolites and isomers has become more frequently reported in environmental assessments yielding important information on the sources and distribution of these contaminants. The integration of environmental/ecological characteristics (e.g., latitude/longitude, salinity, and/or trophic status at sampling locations) and biological variables (e.g., age, gender, life cycle, migration, diet composition, growth rate, food chain length, metabolism, and elimination) are essential elements in order to adequately study the environmental fate and distribution of PFCs and should be more frequently considered in study design. © Published 2011 by the American Chemical Society.","Antarctica; Aquatic biota; Aquatic ecosystem; Aquatic organisms; Biological monitoring; Biological variables; Biomagnification; Critical review; Environmental assessment; Environmental fate; Essential elements; Geographical locations; Global distribution; High concentration; Marine food web; Marine mammals; Mean concentrations; Offshore water; Perfluorinated compounds; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Sampling location; South America; Study design; Trophic status; Biochemistry; Carboxylation; Ecosystems; Geographical distribution; Isomers; Mammals; Metabolism; Tissue; Chemical contamination; carboxylic acid derivative; fresh water; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; unclassified drug; bioaccumulation; dose-response relationship; environmental assessment; environmental fate; fish; food web; freshwater ecosystem; invertebrate; literature review; marine ecosystem; marine mammal; metabolite; pollutant transport; reptile; age distribution; Antarctica; aquatic environment; aquatic species; bioaccumulation; dietary intake; elimination reaction; environmental monitoring; fish; follow up; food chain; geographic distribution; growth rate; invertebrate; lake; latitude; life cycle; marine biology; metabolism; migration; nonhuman; reptile; review; Russian Federation; salinity; sea; sex difference; South America; trophic cascade; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biota; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Antarctica; Russian Federation; South America; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Reptilia"

There is increasing experience in its use in management of anemia in the critically ill. Methods: This review focuses on clinical, experimental papers regarding erythropoietin usage in the critically ill from the Medline database. Data from our intensive care unit (ICU) were also included. Results: Anemia occurs commonly in the critically ill during ICU stay. Erythropoietin responses are blunted in MODS. EPO is an effective means of increasing haemoglobin and reduces blood transfusion. High doses 300-600U/kg of EPO produce erythropoietic responses within 6 days. For the general critical care patient, studies to date have not shown any increase in adverse events, nor any mortality benefit. Conclusion: Clinical indications include those in whom transfusion is difficult, such as Jehovah's witnesses, or patients with antibodies. Data in the critically ill support the use of 600U/kg subcutaneously weekly for 4 weeks, with adjuvant therapy of oral iron 300mg/day, vitamin C 100mg/day, folate 5mg/day and possibly vitamin E. We recommend commencing when Hct is less than 30% in patients likely to remain in the ICU beyond one week. Patients should be monitored for hypertension and haemoglobin response. Erythropoietin use is now established as an efficacious, easy to use and safe method of treating anemia in the critically ill.",alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; blood group antibody; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; folic acid; hemoglobin; iron; oxygen; perfluorooctyl bromide; recombinant erythropoietin; anaphylaxis; anemia; blood clotting disorder; blood transfusion; clinical trial; confusion; convulsion; critical illness; disease exacerbation; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug half life; drug hypersensitivity; drug indication; drug megadose; drug response; drug safety; drug use; flu like syndrome; hallucination; headache; hematocrit; hemoglobin determination; human; hyperbaric oxygen; hypertension; intensive care unit; length of stay; medical literature; MEDLINE; nonhuman; pruritus; rash; religion; review; spleen infarction; thrombocytosis; thromboembolism; thrombosis; urticaria

We conducted a scoping literature review to identify how PFAS are regulated internationally, at the U.S. national level, and at the U.S. state level, as well as drivers of and challenges to implementing PFAS regulations in the U.S. This review captured peer-reviewed scientific literature (e.g., PubMed), grey literature databases (e.g., SciTech Premium Collection), Google searches, and targeted websites (e.g., state health department websites). We identified 454 relevant documents, of which 61 discussed the non-U.S. PFAS policy, 214 discussed the U.S. national-level PFAS policy, and 181 discussed the U.S. state-level PFAS policy. The drivers of and challenges to PFAS regulation were identified through qualitative analysis. The drivers of PFAS policy identified were political support for regulation, social awareness of PFAS, economic resource availability, and compelling scientific evidence. The challenges to implementing PFAS regulations were political limitations, economic challenges, unclear scientific evidence, and practical challenges.

This review assessed recent studies that examined the relationship of air pollution, metals, and other organic pollutants with children’s blood pressure outcomes. We restricted this review to peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2007 and July 2017. We identified a total of 36 articles that estimated associations with childhood blood pressure, of which 14 studies examined the effects of air pollution, 10 examined metals, and 12 examined other organic pollutants including phthalates (n = 4), Bisphenol A (n = 3), polychlorinated biphenols (n = 2), organophosphate pesticides (n = 2), or perfluoroalkyl acids (n = 1). Similar to the established relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and childhood blood pressure, the majority of studies that examined air pollutants, particularly exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, reported associations with increased childhood blood pressure. The literature reported conflicting evidence for metals, and putative evidence of the effects of exposure to phthalates, Bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenols, and pesticides. Overall, our review underscores the need for additional studies that assess the impact of nephrotoxicant exposure during early life, particularly the perinatal period, and blood pressure in childhood. © 2018, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; environmental chemical; organic compound; organophosphate pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; tobacco smoke; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acid; benzhydryl derivative; metal; organic compound; organophosphate; pesticide; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; air pollutant; air pollution; blood pressure; child; disease association; environmental exposure; human; particulate matter; perinatal period; priority journal; Review; adverse event; blood pressure; drug effect; female; hypertension; infant; male; maternal exposure; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; Acids; Air Pollutants; Benzhydryl Compounds; Blood Pressure; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Metals; Organic Chemicals; Organophosphates; Pesticides; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy"

Among these, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a group of organic chemicals, have received global attention due to their estrogen eff;ect, toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. For the removal of EDCs, conventional wastewater treatment methods include flocculation, precipitation, adsorption, etc. However, there are some limitations on these common methods. Herein, in order to enhance the public's understanding of environmental EDCs, the definition of EDCs and the characteristics of several typical EDCs (physical and chemical properties, sources, usage, concentrations in the environment) are reviewed and summarized in this paper. In particular, the methods of EDC removal are reviewed, including the traditional methods of EDC removal, photocatalysis, biodegradation of EDCs and the latest research results of EDC removal. It is proposed that photocatalysis and biodegradation could be used as an environmentally friendly and effcient EDC removal technology. Photocatalytic technology could be one of the water treatment methods with the most potential, with great development prospects due to its high catalytic effciency and low energy consumption. Biodegradation is expected to replace traditional water treatment methods and is also considered to be a highly promising method for effcient removal of EDCs. Besides, we summarize several photocatalysts with high catalytic activity and some fungi, bacteria and algae with strong biodegradability. © 2020 by the authors.",alga; bacterium; biodegradation; catalyst; ecotoxicology; endocrine disruptor; fungus; photochemistry; pollution incidence; wastewater treatment; algae; Fungi

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in cervical cancer progression and metastasis. Recurrence is the primary cause of the increased number of deaths due to cervical cancer. Oncogenes, such as AEG1, Sam-68, FTS and miR-361-5p, induce EMT in cervical cancer. Tumour suppressors, such as LMX-1, SFRP1, klotho, and miR-155, suppress EMT in cervical cancer. Factors such as hypoxia, the radiation dose, cytokines, proteins, transcription factors, and signalling pathways also play an important role in the induction, progression and maintenance of EMT in cervical cancer. Overall, this review describes a wide range of factors with potential roles in EMT that have been identified to date, and this information could be important for the development of new and more effective therapeutics that ameliorate the negative impact of cervical pathogenesis via EMT. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","biological marker; carrier proteins and binding proteins; cell protein; citrate synthase; curcumin; cytoskeleton protein; ephrin receptor B2; fibulin 5; flavanoid; interleukin 6; matrix metalloproteinase; microRNA; microRNA 155; microRNA 361 5p; morusin; Nogo B protein; oncoprotein; potassium chloride cotransporter 3; protein E6; protein E7; protein Sam68; protein tyrosine kinase; transcription factor; transcription factor Snail; transcription factor ZEB1; transforming acidic coiled coil protein; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; AEG 1 gene; antineoplastic activity; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; cell hypoxia; drug mechanism; embryonic stem cell; epithelial mesenchymal transition; Fused Toes Homolog gene; gene expression; genetic association; human; Human papillomavirus type 16; low energy radiation; nonhuman; oncogene; protein expression; protein function; Short Survey; treatment response; tumor growth; uterine cervix cancer; animal; cell transformation; disease course; drug effects; female; gene expression regulation; pathology; signal transduction; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Disease Progression; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Signal Transduction; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"

As a result of this accumulation and partitioning, a breastfeeding infant's intake of these LPECs may be much greater than his/her mother's average daily exposure. Because the developmental period sets the stage for lifelong health, it is important to be able to accurately assess chemical exposures in early life. In many cases, current human health risk assessment methods do not account for differences between maternal and infant exposures to LPECs or for lifestage-specific effects of exposure to these chemicals. Because of their persistence and accumulation in body lipids and partitioning into breast milk, LPECs present unique challenges for each component of the human health risk assessment process, including hazard identification, dose-response assessment, and exposure assessment. Specific biological modeling approaches are available to support both dose-response and exposure assessment for lactational exposures to LPECs. Yet, lack of data limits the application of these approaches. The goal of this review is to outline the available approaches and to identify key issues that, if addressed, could improve efforts to apply these approaches to risk assessment of lactational exposure to these chemicals. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl; environmental chemical; hexachlorobenzene; lipophilic persistent environmental chemical; methylmercury; moxidectin; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; unclassified drug; pollutant; body burden; body fat; breast feeding; breast milk; chemical reaction kinetics; concentration (parameters); environmental exposure; experimental animal; gestational age; half life time; health hazard; human; lactation; mathematical model; metabolic rate; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; prediction; prenatal exposure; review; risk assessment; analysis; animal; breast milk; chemistry; dose response; environmental exposure; female; methodology; pollutant; pregnancy; rat; theoretical model; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Milk, Human; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Pregnancy; Rats; Research Design; Risk Assessment"

Among its advantages are its simplicity, high efficiency, flexibility of operation, and low cost. The biosorptive performance of fungal pellets is getting growing attention since they offer process advantages over the culture of disperse mycelia, such as an enhanced biomass separation, and a high resilience in severe environmental conditions. In this review, biosorption capacity of fungal pellets towards heavy metals, dyes, phenolic compounds, humic substances, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals was reviewed. Available data about the adsorption capacity of pellets, their removal efficiency, and the operational conditions used were collected and synthesized. The studies relying on biodegradation were discarded to present only the possibilities of fungal pellets for removing these concern pollutants through biosorption. It was found that the biosorption of complex mixtures of pollutants on fungal pellets is scarcely studied, as well as the interfering effect of anions commonly found in water and wastewater. Furthermore, there is a lack of research with real wastewater and at pilot and large scale. These topics need to be further explored to take full advantage of fungal pellets on improving the quality of aquatic systems. © 2020 by the authors.",Biodegradation; Biosorption; Efficiency; Heavy metals; Pelletizing; Water pollution; Water pollution control; Adsorption capacities; Biosorption capacity; Environmental biotechnology; Environmental conditions; Operational conditions; Phenolic compounds; Removal efficiencies; Water and wastewater; Fungi; adsorption; biodegradation; biotechnology; cell; complexity; data processing; fungus; pollutant removal; research work; wastewater

In addition, mutations of critical genes cause monogenic diabetes. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary site for proinsulin folding; therefore, ER proteostasis is crucial for both β-cell function and survival under physiological and pathophysiological challenges. Importantly, the ER is also the major intracellular Ca2+ storage organelle, generating Ca2+ signals that contribute to insulin secretion. ER stress is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we summarize the mutations in monogenic diabetes that play causal roles in promoting ER stress in β-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for ER proteostasis imbalance with a focus on T2DM, in which both genetics and environment are considered important in promoting ER stress in β-cells. We also suggest that controlled insulin secretion from β-cells might reduce the progression of a key aspect of the metabolic syndrome, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Finally, we evaluate potential therapeutic approaches to treat T2DM, including the optimization and protection of functional β-cell mass in individuals with T2DM. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.","ABC transporter; ABC transporter C8; adaptor protein; APPL1 protein; calcium; glucokinase; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha; insulin; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2; kruppel like factor; kruppel like factor 11; neurogenic differentiation factor; protein tyrosine kinase; protein tyrosine kinase BLK; transcription factor PAX4; transcription factor PDX 1; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; proinsulin; autoimmunity; calcium cell level; calcium signaling; cell death; cell function; cell size; cell stress; cell survival; disease course; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; environmental factor; gene mutation; heredity; human; inflammation; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin release; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome X; monogenic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; pancreas cell; pancreas islet beta cell; pathophysiology; protein folding; protein homeostasis; Review; unfolded protein response; animal; endoplasmic reticulum stress; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; procedures; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Proinsulin"

Dietary intake is considered as one of the main human exposure pathways of these chemicals and, having entered the human body, PFASs are not metabolised and accumulate in tissues, while their toxicological properties may cause various health problems. Several studies on the occurrence of PFASs in various food types have been conducted, including the assessment of dietary exposure. The most important sources were fish, meat, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables recently showed relatively high levels of PFASs, and have become a more significant source of PFASs than meat. In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion, setting the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 ng kg-1 b.w. for the sum of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesulphonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS). The emphasis in this paper is on the systematization of available information on the distribution of PFASs and their levels in different food, with a special interest in data from the Europe. The current legislation and estimated dietary intakes by the general population are described. While the available information on tolerably daily intakes estimated in a number of European countries often exceeds the newly established EFSA TWI, a critical evaluation of performance characteristics of the reviewed analytical methodologies revealed the insufficient sensitivity of quantification procedures for accurate risk assessment according to the guidelines proposed by EFSA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical contamination; Food safety; Fruits; Health risks; Meats; Organic pollutants; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Dietary intakes; End-products; European food safety authorities; European markets; Exposure assessment; Food contamination; Fruit and vegetables; Human exposures; Polyfluorinated alkyl substances; Tolerable weekly intakes; Vegetables; fat; oil; perfluorinated alkyl substance; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulphonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulphonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluorinated alkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; accuracy assessment; assessment method; chemical substance; food availability; food market; literature review; pollution exposure; risk assessment; analytic method; baby food; bakery product; butter; cereal; cheese; dairy product; dietary exposure; dietary intake; drug tolerability; egg; environmental exposure; European; fish; food availability; food contamination; food safety; fruit; human; law; meat; persistent organic pollutant; potato; Review; risk assessment; sea food; skim milk; social marketing; vegetable; animal; dietary exposure; eating; Europe; Animals; Dietary Exposure; Eating; Eggs; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Meat

These mechanisms are each capable of only partially explaining observations. Transport within marine aerosols has been proposed and may explain transport over short distances but will contribute little over longer distances. However, PFO(A) has been shown to have a very short half-life in aqueous aerosols and thus sea spray was proposed as a mechanism for the generation of PFOA in the gas phase from PFO in a water body. Using the observed PFO concentrations in oceans of the Northern Hemisphere and estimated spray generation rates, this mechanism is shown to have the potential for contributing large amounts of PFOA to the atmosphere and may therefore contribute significantly to the concentrations observed in remote locations. Specifically, the rate of PFOA release into the gas phase from oceans in the Northern Hemisphere is calculated to be potentially comparable to global stack emissions to the atmosphere. The subsequent potential for atmospheric degradation of PFOA and its global warming potential are considered. Observed isomeric ratios and predicted atmospheric concentrations due to FTOH degradation are used to elucidate the likely relative importance of transport pathways. It is concluded that gas phase PFOA released from oceans may help to explain observed concentrations in remote regions. The model calculations performed in the present study strongly suggest that oceanic aerosol and gas phase field monitoring is of vital importance to obtain a complete understanding of the global dissemination of PFCAs. © 2010 SETAC.","Aqueous aerosols; Global warming potential; Long range transport; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Sea spray; Acids; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Concentration (process); Degradation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Ocean currents; Atmospheric movements; fluorine; methyl chloride; perfluoro compound; perfluorocarboxylic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carboxylic acid; global warming; marine atmosphere; Northern Hemisphere; pollutant transport; aerosol; air pollution; aqueous solution; atmosphere; greenhouse effect; priority journal; review; Aerosols; Air Movements; Atmosphere; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Seawater; Steam; Water Pollutants; Arctic"

PFAS cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. Thus, PFAS are a likely risk for neurotoxicity. Studies that measured PFAS levels in the brains of humans, polar bears, and rats have demonstrated that some areas of the brain accumulate greater amounts of PFAS. Moreover, in humans, there is evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and an increased cause of death from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in elderly populations. Given possible links to neurological disease, critical analyses of possible mechanisms of neurotoxic action are necessary to advance the field. This paper critically reviews studies that investigated potential mechanistic causes for neurotoxicity including (1) a change in neurotransmitter levels, (2) dysfunction of synaptic calcium homeostasis, and (3) alteration of synaptic and neuronal protein expression and function. We found growing evidence that PFAS exposure causes neurotoxicity through the disruption of neurotransmission, particularly the dopamine and glutamate systems, which are implicated in age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Evaluated research has shown there are highly reproduced increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus and catecholamine levels in the hypothalamus and decreased dopamine in the whole brain after PFAS exposure. There are significant gaps in the literature relative to the assessment of the nigrostriatal system (striatum and ventral midbrain) among other regions associated with PFAS-associated neurologic dysfunction observed in humans. In conclusion, evidence suggests that PFAS may be neurotoxic and associated with chronic and age-related psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies assess the impact of PFAS and PFAS mixtures on the mechanism of neurotransmission and the consequential functional effects. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",acetylcholine; calcium; calcium channel L type; catecholamine; dopamine; glutamate receptor; glutamic acid; monoamine; neurotransmitter; perfluoro compound; dopamine; fluorocarbon; glutamic acid derivative; Alzheimer disease; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; behavior; bioaccumulation; blood; brain; brain region; calcium cell level; calcium current; calcium homeostasis; calcium signaling; corpus striatum; degenerative disease; hippocampus; human; hypothalamus; mental disease; monoamine metabolism; nerve degeneration; neurotoxicity; neurotransmission; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; protein expression; protein function; Review; synapse; ventral mesencephalon; aged; animal; child; metabolism; pollutant; rat; synaptic transmission; toxicity; toxicity and intoxication; Aged; Animals; Child; Dopamine; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Glutamates; Humans; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Rats; Synaptic Transmission

However, Sertoli cell junctions and cytoskeletons are the target of environmental toxicants. Because germ cells rely on Sertoli cells for the provision of structural/functional/nutritional support, exposure of males to toxicants leads to germ cell exfoliation due to Sertoli cell injuries. Interestingly, the molecular mechanism(s) by which toxicants induce cytoskeletal disruption that leads to germ cell exfoliation is unclear, until recent years, which are discussed herein. This information can possibly be used to therapeutically manage toxicant-induced infertility/subfertility in human males.Areas covered: In this review, we provide a brief update on the use of Sertoli cell system developed for rodents and humans in vitro, which can be deployed in any research laboratory with minimal upfront setup costs. These systems can be used to collect reliable data applicable to studies in vivo. We also discuss the latest findings on the mechanisms by which toxicants induce Sertoli cell injury, in particular cytoskeletal disruption. We also identify candidate molecules that are likely targets of toxicants.Expert opinion: We provide two hypothetical models delineating the mechanism by which toxicants induce germ cell exfoliation and blood-testis barrier disruption.

Certain of these chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, are known to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and associated with adverse health outcomes in humans and animal models. The possible health impacts of exposure to highly fluorinated chemicals are of great concern to communities whose water has been impacted. Community members want information, and are asking for biomonitoring, exposure pathway analysis, and health studies. Governmental agencies are striving to deal with these multiple concerns in the face of information and resource constraints. We propose the development of a high-level research strategy to maximize what can be learned about health effects of highly fluorinated chemicals and methods to reduce or eliminate exposure. We suggest coordinating the research across multiple communities for greater statistical power.

The PPARs are a family of 3 ligand-activated transcription factors: PPARα (NR1C1), PPARβ/δ (NR1C2), and PPARγ (NR1C3). All the PPARs play important roles in the regulation of metabolic pathways, including those of lipid of biosynthesis and glucose metabolism, as well as in a variety of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis pathways. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the involvement of PPARs in the inflammatory processes. In particular, PPARα and PPARγ inhibit the activation of inflammatory gene expression and can negatively interfere with pro-inflammatory transcription factor signalling pathways in vascular and inflammatory cells. In contrast, the roles of PPARβ/δ regulating inflammation and immunity are only just emerging.

Recently, emerging contamination of PFCs is increasing concerns among the environmental quality experts globally due to their toxicity, detrimental effect, persistent and hard to biodegrade in the environment. The mixture of the aqueous solution containing hazardous PFCs has led to serious water contamination into our main water sources and potentially brings tremendously adverse effects, risk of diseases and disorders towards an abiotic and biotic ecosystem that was specifically threatening the living organisms’ health such as plant, animal and human. The elimination of PFCs pollutants is essential and has been crucial to demand attention to conserve pure, clean, and safe water resources. Herein, the feasibility of remediating PFCs from polluted aqueous solution by using various types of functional hybrid adsorbents based on natural polymers through a superior adsorptive mechanism has been reported in detail in this review paper. Particularly, the use of natural and renewable polymeric material on the fabrication of natural polymer-based adsorbents has been owing to their peculiar characteristics such as biodegradability, economic viability, the potential to reuse, and comprised of abundantly functional groups that can encourage and empower the elimination process of PFCs. The adsorption behaviour on several classes of PFCs onto different types of hybrid adsorbents was summarized, and various possible interactions mechanism like electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydrogen bonding were fully reviewed. Moreover, the adsorption performance removal on PFCs between single-based adsorbent and multiple-based adsorbents was systematically compared and described to determine the execution removal capabilities for each adsorbent. In addition to a detailed review of the published studies, the kinetics and isotherms aspects of PFCs adsorption were reported with various adsorption models, and several adsorption parameters such as the effects of&#8232;initial PFCs concentration, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on adsorption performance were investigated and the regeneration potential of the adsorbent was also discussed in this article. © 2021, The Polymer Society, Taipei.",Biodegradability; Biodegradable polymers; Health risks; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Ion exchange; Manufacture; Textile industry; Water pollution; Adsorption performance; High thermal; Hybrid adsorbents; Hybrid natural polymer; Manufacturing industries; Perfluorinated compounds; Property; Review papers; Surface activities; Water contamination; Adsorption

Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce.

Pauluhn J.,Acute inhalation studies with irritant aerosols: Technical issues and relevance for risk characterization,2004,10.1007/s00204-003-0516-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2942527519&doi=10.1007%2fs00204-003-0516-1&partnerID=40&md5=a367f4e20dde47f222866f9428258df7,"Current testing conventions for inhalation toxicity studies require that solid and non-volatile liquid compounds are converted to respirable aerosol, which is often achieved by laboratory-specific technical methodologies. So far, internationally harmonized approaches are lacking that would allow comparison of results from inhalation studies with 'contrived' test aerosols taking into account the actual particle size of the product as it might be encountered in normal handling and use. The focus of this paper is to consider aerosols of irritant substances eliciting their mode of action on sites of initial deposition within the respiratory tract of rats. Assessment is based on conventional endpoints, such as mortality (LC50), and sublethal endpoints that include an analysis for the concentration-effect relationship of protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL-protein) as a sensitive, early marker of lung edema. This retrospective analysis also addresses whether common denominators can be found for different aerosol sizes of direct and indirect irritants, such as monomeric and polymeric diphenylmethane-4,4′- diisocyanate (mMDI and pMDI), naphthylene diisocyanate (NDI), dicyclohexylmethane-4,4′-diisocyanate (HMDI), 2,4-triisopropyl-benzene- diisocyanate (TRIDI) and substances (e.g., chlorofluoroalkyl side-chain fungicides) known to decompose to irritant intermediates in the lining fluids of the airways. Collectively, this analysis shows that for irritant aerosols both the concentration and the particle size are equally important for the outcome of the test, independent of whether the endpoint chosen is lethality or BAL protein. The scientific value of 1-h exposures to high aerosol concentrations, as required by some regulations, could be challenged because high concentrations and high respirability of aerosol appear to be mutually exclusive, as shown for mMDI and NDI (LC50 &gt; 2000 mg/m3). Thus, for a meaningful risk characterization, test results from inhalation studies with 'contrived properties' due to the specific techniques employed need to be compared with the real properties of substances as marketed, handled and used. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","1,5 naphthalenediisocyanate; 2,4 triisopropylbenzene diisocyanate; dicyclohexylmethane 4,4' diisocyanate; diphenylmethane 4,4' diisocyanate; fungicide; isocyanic acid derivative; unclassified drug; aerosol; airway; animal experiment; animal model; concentration response; controlled study; female; inhalation; lethality; lung edema; lung lavage; male; mortality; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; rat; respiratory system; review; risk assessment; toxicity testing; Acute Toxicity Tests; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Animals; Cyanates; Irritants; Isocyanates; Lethal Dose 50; Naphthalenes; Polyurethanes; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment"

International environmental protection agencies are currently looking for ways to detect and safely remediate both solid and aqueous PFAS waste due to their harmful effects. Incineration is a technique that disposes of chemicals by breaking down the chemicals at high temperatures, upwards of 1400◦ C. Incineration has been used on other related compounds, but PFAS presents a challenge during thermal degradation due to the molecular stability and reactivity of fluorine. Research on the efficacy of this method is currently limited, as the degradation byproducts of PFAS are not fully characterized. Current research is mostly focused on the development of benchtop methods for the safe remediation of solid PFAS waste. Aqueous fire fighting foams (AFFFs) have garnered significant attention due to extensive use since development in the 1960s. Numerous communities that are closely located near airports have been shown to have higher than average PFAS contamination from the repeated use. Detection and remediation of surface, subsurface, and wastewater have become a primary concern for environmental agencies. Use of electrochemical techniques to remove the PFAS contaminants has shown recent promise to help address this issue. Critical to the remediation efforts is development of standardized detection techniques and the implementation of local and international regulations to control the production and use of fluorinated products. No single solution has yet been developed, but much progress has been made in recent years in governmental regulation, detection, and remediation techniques. © 2020 by the authors.

Such imaging is made possible through laser-optical pumping, which can improve the magnetic resonance sensitivity of certain noble-gas isotopes having non-zero nuclear spin by several orders of magnitude. The two most important isotopes are the spin one-half nuclei 3He and 129Xe, because of their long intrinsic T1 relaxation times. We recall that the conventional thermal polarization Pth in an applied magnetic field B0 is given by Pth=μB0/kBT, where μ is the nuclear magnetic moment, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvins. For fully relaxed protons in a conventional 1.5 T applied field for whole-body MRI, we have Pth=6×10-6, which suffices for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of protons in water. Gases delivered at pressures of ≈1 atm are over 2000 times less dense than protons in water with a corresponding decrease in MR sensitivity, but hyperpolarization yields an enhancement of 4 to 5 orders of magnitude (Phyp=10-50%), more than compensating for the density difference. Indeed, highly polarized 3He can remain sufficiently sensitive to MRI even if it constitutes only a fraction of the inhaled gas mixture. Once introduced in vivo to the lungs, depending on the breathing maneuver and the inhaled mixture, HP gases relax with a time T1=20-30 s, where the relaxation is dominated by interaction with paramagnetic oxygen. In the glass cell used for hyperpolarization, T1 values are much longer, ranging from 20 to 40 h. Because the function of the lung is gas exchange, it is hardly surprising that regionally specific information about inspired gas should be at least as relevant to the study of lung physiology and disease as images of the lung-tissue structure (e.g. hydrogen MRI or X-ray CT). Results from several research groups have indeed demonstrated the potential for HP-gas MRI to enhance our understanding of lung function, with further potential impact on disease treatment, surgical planning, and drug development. (Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma affect tens of millions of people in the US alone [1]). Almost immediately from the time that the first animal- and then human-lung images were demonstrated [2-5], several groups have explored pulse-sequence techniques and contrast mechanisms that go well beyond static spin-density imaging and that make use of the unique physical properties of these gases to address physiologically relevant questions. This article deals largely with one such contrast mechanism: diffusion (i.e. Brownian motion) of gas in the lung. Rapid gas diffusion can cause problems ranging from limited image resolution to signal attenuation due to the presence of bulk susceptibility and/or imaging gradients. However, as with relaxation due to the presence of oxygen (see below), there is a flip side to the story that enables meaningful physiological information to be obtained. Indeed, an early conclusion in HP 3He MRI, based on the fact that diffusion does not limit signal intensity or resolution as much as might be expected, was that airway and alveolar boundaries restrict the diffusive motion of 3He in healthy lung [6,7]. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the gas can thus be a powerful indicator of local airway and alveolar architecture, which is itself often profoundly affected by lung disorders, such as COPD [8]. Most of the imaging discussed here involves HP 3He, as it has been most widely used to date in studies of lung ADC. However, we also consider in this regard other gases that may be used as MRI signal sources. Other noble-gas isotopes (principally 129Xe) can be hyperpolarized and have been used for lung imaging [9]. Although 129Xe has only 1/3 the magnetic moment of 3He and has generally been more technically challenging to polarize in large quantities, it provides unique contrast in that it is taken up by the blood from the lung and exhibits a wide chemical shift range when dissolved in a variety of tissues [10]. The excitement generated by HP-gas MRI has also contributed to a renewed interest in the use of inert fluorinated gases to image the lungs [11,12]; these gases have a number of features that somewhat mitigate the disadvantage of a small (thermally generated) nuclear polarization, and they are technically easier to handle and use, particularly for in vivo studies. Before turning exclusively to diffusion MRI, we will first briefly discuss how hyperpolarized gas is generated and imaged. We will also highlight (though by no means exhaustively), some of the developments in the last 10 years across the field of lung imaging with HP gases. More complete reviews of the field may be found in Refs. [13,14]. The subsequent sections on diffusion MRI are based largely on research done by the group at Washington University, where it has been a major effort for the past 8 years. We will start with how simple measurements of 3He ADC can be used to gauge the regional severity of tissue destruction due to emphysema. We then discuss a more detailed model of airway architecture that can be tested by investigating 3He diffusion anisotropy. The fact that gases diffuse so rapidly affords the opportunity to explore lung structure on many different length scales, and the next section discusses experiments to measure long-range 3He diffusion in the lung. Finally, we present some recent work involving 19F diffusion MRI. Hyperpolarization of 3He: 3He is a stable non-radioactive isotope of helium with nuclear spin 1/2 and a gyromagnetic ratio about 25% smaller than the proton; it has ≈1 ppm natural abundance but is available in pure form as the result of collection from tritium decay. The nucleus can be polarized to values approaching unity by transfer of angular momentum from circularly polarized laser light. There are two basic schemes for this transfer: metastability-exchange optical pumping (MEOP) [15,16] and spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) [17]. In both schemes, the 3He gas typically resides in a glass vessel (cell) through which the laser light is directed. In MEOP, a radio-frequency discharge is ignited in the cell to create a population of 3He atoms in the triplet-2S metastable electron state. Optical pumping with 1083 nm laser light, corresponding to transitions from the triplet-2S to certain triplet-2P states, leads to a large electron polarization in the metastable state, which is immediately transferred to the nucleus via hyperfine coupling. Rapid electron-exchange collisions then produce nuclear polarized 3He atoms in the ground state. In SEOP, an alkali metal (usually rubidium) serves as an intermediary in the angular momentum-transfer process. Laser light is absorbed by the Rb vapor at a wavelength of 795 nm, corresponding to the first principal dipole transition (5S1/2-5P1/2), causing the Rb valence electron to become highly polarized. A density of Rb vapor appropriate to the amount of available laser light is produced in the cell by heating it to 160-200 °C. The angular momentum is then transferred to the 3He nucleus via a hyperfine interaction (zero-quantum transition) that takes place during Rb-3He binary collisions. In both methods, the mechanism for polarization transfer is easily turned off (in MEOP by terminating the discharge and in SEOP by cooling down the cell and condensing the Rb vapor), leaving the angular momentum stored in the form of polarized 3He nuclei. The longitudinal relaxation time of the gas (usually dominated by collisions with the cell walls) can, with some attention given to how the cell is fabricated, be many 10 s of hours, allowing sufficient time for storage and transport of the hyperpolarized gas to an MRI scanner. We note that the SEOP method can also be used to hyperpolarize the other stable and abundant spin-1/2 noble-gas isotope, 129Xe. Generally speaking, MEOP has historically had the advantage of an intrinsically faster production rate and largest maximum 3He polarization, routinely producing quantities ∼1 STP-liter/hour at &gt;60% polarization [18]. However, the RF discharge requires that the gas be polarized at pressures ∼1 Torr and then compressed to atmospheric pressures without causing significant polarization loss [19]. In addition, the lasers used in MEOP have been somewhat more expensive and more difficult to maintain. Initial large-scale polarization systems have been large and expensive, but much more portable and inexpensive MEOP systems have been recently demonstrated [20]. By contrast, SEOP systems have the advantage of cheap powerful portable lasers and the ability to operate at helium pressures between 1 and 10 atm but a slower intrinsic production rate; a typical system requires many hours to produce 1 STP-liter of HP 3He [21]. SEOP is a photon-limited process, and the introduction in the 1990s of compact inexpensive diode-laser arrays, capable of several tens of watts at 795 nm, was a crucial technological advance that allowed the production of quantities of HP 3He sufficient for human-lung MRI. Recently, the simultaneous use of both rubidium and potassium metals in a SEOP cell has been shown to improve the HP 3He production rate by an order of magnitude [22]. ...",Biological organs; Carbon inorganic compounds; Diffusion in gases; Isotopes; Magnetic field effects; Magnetic resonance imaging; Optical pumping; Oxygen; Paramagnetic materials; Protons; Pulmonary diseases; Quantum theory; 3He; Boltzmann constants; Hyperpolarized; Laser pumping; Thermal polarization; Helium

As an enzyme, CD13 regulates activities of numerous cytokines by cleaving their N-terminals and is involved in Ag processing by trimming the peptides bound to MHC class II. Independent of its enzymatic activity, cell membrane CD13 functions by cross-linking–induced signal transduction, regulation of receptor recycling, enhancement of FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, and acting as a receptor for cytokines. Moreover, soluble CD13 has multiple proinflammatory roles mediated by binding to G-protein–coupled receptors. CD13 not only modulates development and activities of immune-related cells, but also regulates functions of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, CD13 is important in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. Inhibitors of CD13 have shown impressive anti-inflammatory effects, but none of them has yet been used for clinical therapy of human inflammatory diseases. We reevaluate CD13’s regulatory role in inflammation and suggest that CD13 could be a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.

Brazil is a country that produces and consumes many cosmetics, and the treated cosmetic industry wastewaters must meet standards established by Brazilian environmental agencies to be discharged into receiving water bodies. This review seeks to evaluate the characteristics of both raw and treated cosmetic wastewaters and the treatment methods adopted by Brazilian cosmetic industries. It was observed a wide variation of COD and BOD5 values for the raw wastewater samples, e.g. COD varied from 850 to 36,000 mg.L−1. More than 50% of the raw wastewaters showed high biodegradability, since BOD5/COD ratio was above 0.37. Conventional treatments have met a minimum 60% removal levels for BOD5, according to current federal legislation. However, few samples fell within the most restrictive state legislation limits, and treatments were not effective in eliminating wastewater toxicity. Interestingly, COD and BOD5 values for raw and treated wastewaters could be linearly correlated (R2 values &gt; 0.8). The straight-line equations obtained in this work can be used to estimate BOD5 from COD data, since the latter is easier to obtain. Regarding alternative treatments evaluated in bench-scale, Fenton processes and electrocoagulation have removed more than 90% of COD in raw cosmetic industry wastewaters.

Perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) are the most studied PFAAs due to their global occurrence. PFAAs are environmentally persistent, toxic, and the long-chain homologs are also bioaccumulative. Exposure to PFAAs may arise directly from emission or indirectly via the environmental release and degradation of PFAA precursors. Precursors themselves or their conversion intermediates can present deleterious effects, including hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and genetic toxicity. Therefore, exposure to PFAA precursors constitutes a potential hazard for environmental contamination. In order to comprehensively evaluate the environmental fate and effects of PFAA precursors and their connection with PFSAs and PFCAs, we review environmental biodegradability studies carried out with microbial strains, activated sludge, plants, and earthworms over the past decade. In particular, we review perfluorooctyl-sulfonamide-based precursors, including perfluroooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and its N-ethyl derivative (EtFOSA), N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol (EtFOSE), and EtFOSE-based phosphate diester (DiSAmPAP). Fluorotelomerization-based precursors are also reviewed, including fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOH), fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSA), and a suite of their transformation products. Though limited information is currently available on zwitterionic PFAS precursors, a preliminary review of data available for 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide betaine (FTAB) was also conducted. Furthermore, we update and refine the recent knowledge on biotransformation strategies with a focus on metabolic pathways and mechanisms involved in the biotransformation of PFAA precursors. The biotransformation of PFAA precursors mainly involves the cleavage of carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds and the degradation of non-fluorinated functional groups via oxidation, dealkylation, and defluorination to form shorter-chained PFAAs.

This review is devoted to the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted polyfluorobenzenes, which, like their non-fluorinated analogues, are important intermediate products in routes to condensed aromatic and heterocyclic compounds. It is appropriate to classify methods for the preparation of 1,2-disubstituted polyfluorobenzenes into five principal groups. © 1985.",NA

Here, we used in silico mining to predict the polypeptide composition of available transcriptomic data of Turbinaria peltata. In total, 118 transcripts encoding putative peptide precursors were discovered. One neuropeptide Y/F-like peptide, named TpNPY, was identified and selected for in silico structural, in silico binding, and pharmacological studies. In our study, the anti-inflammation effect of TpNPY was evaluated using an LPS-stimulated C8-D1A astrocyte cell model. Our results demonstrated that TpNPY, at 0.75-3 μM, inhibited LPS-induced NO production and reduced the expression of iNOS in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, TpNPY reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, treatment with TpNPY reduced LPS-mediated elevation of ROS production and the intracellular calcium concentration. Further investigation revealed that TpNPY downregulated the IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibited expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Through molecular docking and using an NPY receptor antagonist, TpNPY was shown to have the ability to interact with the NPY Y1 receptor. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that TpNPY might prevent LPS-induced injury in astrocytes through activation of the NPY-Y1R. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

NA,Endocrine disrupting chemicals: Impacts on human fertility and fecundity during the peri-conception period,2021,NA,NA,"It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than 1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans, dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",NA

It is inactive when bound to guanosine diphosphate and active when bound to GTP. When mutated, the gene produces an abnormal protein resistant to GTP hydrolysis by GTPase, resulting in a constitutively active GTP-bound protein that stimulates a critical network of signal transduction pathways that lead to cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation. At least three downstream effector pathways have been described, including Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and RalGDS, but they are not completely understood. Ras pathways are also important downstream effectors of several receptor tyrosine kinases localized in the cell membrane, most notably the BCR-ABL fusion protein seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. An important consideration in designing strategies to block Ras stimulatory effect is that Ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, but require post-translational modifications and attachment to anchor proteins or membrane binding sites in the cell membrane to be biologically active. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are probably the best-studied class of Ras inhibitors in hematologic malignancies. They block the enzyme farnesyl-transferase (FTase), which is essential for post-translational modification. However, it has been observed that the Ras proteins also can be geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs, thus allowing membrane localization and activation, which limits their effectiveness. It is now hypothesized that their mechanism of action may be through FTase inhibition involving other signal transduction pathways. S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, which was first designed as a prenylated protein methyltransferase inhibitor, has shown in vitro activity against all activated Ras proteins by dislodging them from their membrane-anchoring sites. Here, Ras biology, its signaling pathways and its implications as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies are reviewed. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.","3 benzyl 7 cyano 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1 (1h imidazol 4 ylmethyl) 4 (2 thienylsulfonyl) 1h 1,4 benzodiazepine; 5 [n [5 (2 benzoxazolyl) 1 methyl 2 [3,4 (methylenedioxy)phenyl] 4 pentenyl] n (2 naphthylmethyl)carbamoyl] 1,3 dioxolane 2,2,4 tricarboxylic acid; bms 184467; bms 185878; bms 186511; centromere protein E; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; cytotoxic agent; dasatinib; etoposide; fluorouracil; hormone derivative; idarubicin; imatinib; l 731735; l 778123; lonafarnib; n (8 amino 2 benzyl 5 isopropyl 9 mercapto 3,6 nonadienoyl)methionine; n [[5 [(2 amino 3 mercaptopropyl)amino][1,1' biphenyl] 2 yl]carbonyl]methionine; paclitaxel; protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor; protein kinase B; purine nucleoside derivative; RhoB guanine nucleotide binding protein; rpr 115135; tamoxifen; tipifarnib; unclassified drug; vinblastine; vincristine; acute granulocytic leukemia; anorexia; apoptosis; ataxia; blood toxicity; bone marrow suppression; cancer screening; cancer survival; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; cell differentiation; cell membrane; cell motility; cell proliferation; cell survival; cell transformation; chronic myeloid leukemia; clinical trial; colon tumor; combination chemotherapy; confusion; diarrhea; drug dose escalation; drug effect; drug potentiation; drug withdrawal; dysarthria; fatigue; gastrointestinal disease; human; hydrolysis; hyperbilirubinemia; hypokalemia; kidney failure; liver failure; lung tumor; membrane binding; metabolic acidosis; monotherapy; mucosa inflammation; multiple cycle treatment; multiple myeloma; mutation; myelodysplastic syndrome; nausea; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oncogene ras; pancreas tumor; peripheral neuropathy; Philadelphia chromosome positive cell; protein phosphorylation; rash; relapse; review; risk factor; side effect; signal transduction; splenomegaly; thyroid tumor; urinary dysfunction; vomiting; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Delivery Systems; Genes, ras; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Signal Transduction"

PFAS have strong chemical structures and their bonding with soil makes them challenging to eliminate from soil environments. Traditional methods of soil remediation have not been successful in their reduction or removal from the environment. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of existing and emerging technologies for remediating PFAS contaminated soils with guidance on which approach to use in different contexts. The functions of all remediation technologies, their suitability, limitations, and the scale applied from laboratory to the field are presented as a baseline for understanding the research need for treatment in soil environments. To date, the immobilization method has been a significant part of the remediation solution for PFAS contaminated soils, although its long-term efficiency still needs further investigation. Soil washing and thermal treatment techniques have been tested at the field scale, but they are expensive and energy-intensive due to the use of a large volume of washing solvent and the high melting point of PFAS, respectively; both methods need a large initial investment for their installation. Other remediation technologies, such as chemical oxidation, ball milling, and electron beams, have been progressed in the laboratory. However, additional research is needed to make them feasible, cost-effective and applicable in the field. © 2019",chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorohexane 1 sulphonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; soil organic matter; toxic substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; chemical substance; contaminated land; detection method; immobilization; separation; soil pollution; soil remediation; soil stabilization; adsorption; bioremediation; chemical binding; chemical structure; desorption; electron beam; oxidation; physical chemistry; Review; soil pollution; soil treatment; ecosystem restoration; soil; soil pollutant; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fluorocarbons; Soil; Soil Pollutants

The entry of those chemicals to water bodies occurs mainly through the sewage effluents from wastewater treatment plants due to their incomplete or inefficient removal. The purpose of this review was to collect and analyze data about the incidence and concentrations of PCPs reported as emerging pollutants in different water matrices, including wastewater influents and effluents. Our database is composed of 141 articles with information about 72 PCPs recorded as emerging pollutants in 30 countries, in concentrations ranging from 0.029 ng/L to 7.811 × 106 ng/L. Fragrances, antiseptics and sunscreens were the most reported groups. As expected, the largest number of PCPs documented as emerging pollutants were found in wastewater treatment plant effluents with a total of 64 compounds, compared to 43 in surface water and 23 in groundwater, which evidence the anthropological contribution of PCPs to water bodies. These molecules were found in all the continents, however, there is a lack of information regarding the presence of emerging pollutants from PCPs in developing countries. Therefore, we suggest further efforts in assessing the occurrence and concentrations of these chemicals in those areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Chemicals; Developing countries; Endocrine disrupters; Filtration; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Odors; Sewage; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Surface waters; Toxicity; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Aquatic environments; Emerging pollutants; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; PCPs; Personal care products; Reproductive disorders; Wastewater treatment plant effluent; Wastewater treatment plants; Effluents; antiinfective agent; chemicals and drugs; diethyltoluamide; disinfectant agent; fragrance; galaxolide; ground water; insect repellent; methyl paraben; oxybenzone; personal care product; preservative; sunscreen; surface water; triclocarban; triclosan; unclassified drug; cosmetic; concentration (composition); developing world; effluent; endocrine disruptor; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; PPCP; wastewater; water quality; water resource; chemical analysis; effluent; environmental impact assessment; Review; sludge; Spain; United States; waste water management; water contamination; water pollution; water supply; analysis; environmental monitoring; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; water supply; Hexapoda; Cosmetics; Environmental Monitoring; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Resources"

These chemicals are now subject to strict government regulations, leading to costly environmental remediation efforts. Commercial polyfluorinated compounds have been called ‘forever chemicals’ due to their strong resistance to biological and chemical degradation. Environmental cleanup by bioremediation is not considered practical currently. Implementation of bioremediation will require uncovering and understanding the rare microbial successes in degrading these compounds. This review discusses the underlying reasons why microbial degradation of heavily fluorinated compounds is rare. Fluorinated and chlorinated compounds are very different with respect to chemistry and microbial physiology. Moreover, the end product of biodegradation, fluoride, is much more toxic than chloride.

NP is one of the most widely consumed drugs in the world, because it is available over the counter in many countries. Many studies have proven that NP is not eliminated in conventional water treatment processes and its biodegradation in the environment is also difficult compared to other drugs. Along these lines, we are aware that both the original compound and its metabolites can be found in different destinations in the environment. To assess the environmental exposure and the risks associated with NP, it is important to understand better the environment where they finally reach, the behavior of its original compounds, its metabolites, and its transformation products. In this sense, the purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge about the introduction and behavior of NP in the environments they reach and highlight research needs and gaps.

Initial metabolism occurs primarily in the liver and involves N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P-450IA2 and N-acetylation by acetyltransferase, which serve as competing activation and detoxification reactions, respectively. Both enzymes are polymorphic in humans and individual phenotype can be readily assessed using caffeine ingested in coffee followed by urinary metabolite analysis. N-hydroxy arylamines can then be transported through the blood where they can form protein adducts with hemoglobin or undergo renal filtration into the urinary bladder lumen where, at acidic pH, they can react covalently with urothelial DNA. Carcinogen-DNA adduct levels in human bladder are smoking-related and the C8-deoxyguanosine derivative of 4-amino-biphenyl (ABP) is a major product. Alternatively, N-hydroxy arylamines can be conjugated in the liver by glucuronyl transferases which provides a mechanism for biliary transport to the colon lumen where beta-glucuronidases can regenerate the aglycone. In the colon mucosa, acetyltransferases can further activate the N-hydroxy metabolite by O-acetylation; and persons with the rapid acetylation phenotype are known to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer.

Methods: Twenty-four patients, 11 males and 13 females, age 24 to 74 (mean 50.5 ± 13.1) provided one site with an intraosseous defect ≥4 mm and were divided equally and randomly into two groups. Following debridement both groups were grafted with a bovine-derived xenograft coated with a synthetic cell-binding peptide; then the test group received an NP membrane and the control group received a P membrane. All defects were reentered after 9 months. Measurements were performed by a masked examiner. Results: There were no statistically significant differences (P >0.05) between NP and P groups for any open or closed probing measurement at any time. Similar open initial defect depth for the NP group and P groups (4.8 versus 5.0 mm) demonstrated identical 9-month defect fill of 2.8 mm (57%) for both groups. A difference in crestal resorption for the NP compared to the P group (0.4 versus 0.8 mm) accounted for the difference in mean percent defect resolution, which was 67% for NP compared to 72% for the P group. Overall, nine (75%) of the NP group defects and eight (67%) of the P group defects showed more than 50% defect fill. Conclusion: Treatment of vertical osseous defects with nonporous or porous polytetrafluoroethylene membranes in combination with a xenograft resulted in statistically significant improvement in open and closed probing measurements, with no significant difference between treatment groups.","peptide derivative; politef; adult; aged; bone defect; bone regeneration; cattle; clinical article; clinical study; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; debridement; female; human; male; measurement; membrane; osteolysis; periodontal disease; porosity; randomized controlled trial; review; statistical significance; xenograft; Adult; Aged; Alveolar Bone Loss; Animals; Bone Matrix; Bone Regeneration; Bone Substitutes; Bone Transplantation; Cattle; Durapatite; Female; Guided Tissue Regeneration, Periodontal; Humans; Male; Membranes, Artificial; Middle Aged; Oral Surgical Procedures; Periodontal Index; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Porosity"

Of the thousands of PFAS used by consumers and industry, very few have been thoroughly characterized for potential adverse effects. This is especially true for the novel short-chain (C < 8) alternatives that replaced legacy PFAS. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances have revealed inconsistencies in the toxicokinetics predicted by animal models and empirical findings in humans. To adequately assess the possible health effects of short-chain PFAS, there is a need for robust aggregated data sets on the mechanistic underpinnings and physiochemical properties of these alternatives. Acquiring relevant data on the health effects of short-chain PFAS can be achieved through high-throughput methods supported by in vitro human cell-based models.

Increasing number of emerging pollutants resulting from industrial/human-made activities represents a serious menace to the ecological and environmental equilibrium. Industrial dyes, endocrine disrupters, pesticides, phenols and halogenated phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other xenobiotics are among the top priority environmental pollutants. Some classical remediation approaches including physical, chemical and biological are being employed, but are ineffective in cleaning the environment. Enzyme-catalyzed transformation reactions are gearing accelerating attention in this context as potential alternatives to classical chemical methods. Peroxidases are catalysts able to decontaminate an array of toxic compounds by a free radical mechanism resulting in oxidized or depolymerized products along with a significant toxicity reduction. Admittedly, enzymatic catalysis offers the hallmark of high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity and superior catalytic efficiency under given reaction environment. Moreover, enzymes are considered more benign, socially acceptable and greener production routes since derived from the renewable and sustainable feedstock. Regardless of their versatility and potential use in environmental processes, several limitations, such as heterologous production, catalytic stability, and redox potential should be overcome to implement peroxidases at large-scale transformation and bio-elimination of recalcitrant pollutants. In this article, a critical review of the transformation of different types of hazardous pollutants by peroxidases, with special reference to the proposed reaction mechanisms of several dyes is presented. Following that major challenges for industrial and environmental applications of peroxidases are also discussed. Towards the end, the information is also given on miscellaneous applications of peroxidases, concluding remarks and outlook. © 2018","Biochemistry; Catalysis; Chemical cleaning; Enantioselectivity; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental protection; Enzymes; Free radicals; Hazards; Phenols; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Redox reactions; Stripping (dyes); Catalytic pathways; Chemical and biologicals; Emerging pollutants; Environmental applications; Environmental pollutants; Hazardous contaminants; Peroxidases; Transformation Reactions; Pollution; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; chlorphenotane; dye; endosulfan; estradiol; genistein; hydrogen peroxide; nonylphenol; peroxidase; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sitosterol; triclosan; xenobiotic agent; coloring agent; peroxidase; catalysis; catalyst; chemical reaction; dye; environmental protection; pollutant removal; toxicity; biocatalysis; catalysis; degradation; economics; environmental impact; environmental parameters; industrial production; oxidation reduction potential; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein engineering; reaction analysis; Review; synthesis; waste component removal; bioremediation; human; metabolism; pollutant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Coloring Agents; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Peroxidases; Pesticides; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"

The optimal ventilatory strategy may be difficult to achieve, especially in patients with respiratory failure. Total liquid ventilation is a process whereby a liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) replaces both the functional residual capacity and the tidal volume within the lung. Gas exchange is accomplished by mechanically assisted inspiration and expiration of tidal volumes of the liquid using a liquid ventilator. The PFC liquid is then oxygenated and purged of carbon dioxide by a membrane lung. Perfluorocarbons are excellent media for gas exchange due to their extraordinary gas solubility and diffusibility of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) is a modified method of the total liquid ventilation technique. In PLV, a functional residual capacity of PFC liquid is maintained in the lung, and the patient is ventilated with a conventional gas mechanical ventilator. Studies of the acute respiratory distress syndrome in animal models and in human series have demonstrated encouraging results using PLV and PFC. The high density, low surface tension, and other qualities of PFC in the setting of PLV may offer a highly innovative approach that can be directed toward the management of patients in respiratory failure.","fluorocarbon; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal; artificial ventilation; chemistry; drug effect; functional residual capacity; human; lung gas exchange; methodology; pathophysiology; review; tidal volume; treatment outcome; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Functional Residual Capacity; Humans; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Tidal Volume; Treatment Outcome"

This article reviews the influence of soil- and water-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the environmental fate of PFAS. In addition to being co-adsorped with PFAS to increase the adsorption capacity, DOM competes with PFAS for adsorption sites on the surface of the material, thereby reducing the removal rate of PFAS or increasing water solubility, which facilitates desorption of PFAS in the soil. It can quench some active species and inhibit the degradation of PFAS. In contrast, before DOM in water self-degrades, DOM has a greater promoting effect on the degradation of PFAS because DOM can complex with iron, iodine, among others, and act as an electron shuttle to enhance electron transfer. In soil aggregates, DOM can prevent microorganisms from being poisoned by direct exposure to PFAS. In addition, DOM increases the desorption of PFAS in plant root soil, affecting its bioavailability. In general, DOM plays a bidirectional role in adsorption, degradation, and plant uptake of PFAS, which depends on the types and functional groups of DOM. It is necessary to enhance the positive role of DOM in reducing the environmental risks posed by PFAS. In future, attention should be paid to the DOM-induced reduction of PFAS and development of a green and efficient continuous defluorination technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemistry; Degradation; Desorption; Dissolution; Luminescence of liquids and solutions; Organic compounds; Soils; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption site; Dissolved organic matter; Dissolved organic matters; Environmental fate; Perfluorinated compound; Perfluorinated compounds; Plant uptake; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Soil and water; Adsorption; dissolved organic matter; iodine; iron; perfluoro compound; polyfunctional group; water; 2,5 dimethoxy 4 methylamphetamine; dissolved organic matter; fluorocarbon; adsorption; biological uptake; chemical substance; dissolved organic matter; environmental degradation; environmental fate; literature review; adsorption; bioavailability; defluorination; desorption; electron transport; environmental impact; environmental risk; photochemistry; photodegradation; plant root; Review; soil; water solubility; adsorption; metabolism; soil pollutant; 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamine; Adsorption; Dissolved Organic Matter; Fluorocarbons; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Water"

Environmental factors seem to contribute to neurodegeneration in genetically susceptible individuals. Increasing evidence point towards a key role for environmental exposure in the causation of neurodegenerative disorders and specifically for metal exposure. Alterations of metalloproteins seem to be a common motif in neurodegeneration and enough evidence has now accumulated to designate these disorders as metallopathies. Paired sampling refers to the simultaneous sampling of CSF and blood and by comparing metal concentrations between CSF and blood conclusions about exposure and barrier properties can be drawn. However previous reports on metal concentrations in body fluids in neurodegenerative disorders show a wide variation in results hampering firm conclusions on the role of metals in degeneration of nerve cells. Here we suggest some steps and measures to minimise this variation, most important sampling performed in a cleanroom with filtered air and the use of acid washed perfluoroalkoxy vials. By strict adherence to ultraclean paired sampling technique conclusive results concerning the role of metals in neurodegenerative disorders can be generated. © 2018",copper; lead; magnesium; manganese; polypropylene; trace metal; vanadium; zinc; trace element; air quality; blood analysis; blood brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; chemical analysis; degenerative disease; environmental factor; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; lubrication; lumbar puncture; molecular weight; priority journal; Review; trace metal blood level; analysis; blood; degenerative disease; environmental exposure; mass spectrometry; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Trace Elements

They often end up in the environment, not only being not easily decomposed but also being accumulated. Moreover, they may cause serious toxic problems such as reproductive and developmental defects, immunological toxicity, and carcinogenesis. Hence, they are called environmental pollutants. It is known that the environmental pollutants easily enter the body through various channels such as respiration, ingestion of food, and skin contact etc. in everyday life. If they enter the mother through the placenta, they can cause the disturbance in embryo development as well as malfunction of organs after birth because early prenatal developmental process is highly sensitive to toxic chemicals and stress. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that consist of inner cell mass of blastocyst differentiate into distinct cell lineages via three germ layers such as the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm due to their pluripotency. The differentiation process initiated from ESCs reflects dynamic nature of embryonic development. Therefore, ESCs have been used as a useful tool to investigate early developmental toxicities of a variety of stress. Based on relatively recent scientific results, this review would address toxicity of a few chemical substances that have been widely used as pesticide, antibiotics, and industrial excipient on ESCs based-prenatal developmental process.

The initial stage of cytokinesis requires a tubulin homolog, FtsZ, which forms polymers that treadmill around the cell circumference. The attachment of these polymers to the cytoplasmic membrane requires an actin homolog, FtsA, which also forms dynamic polymers that directly bind to FtsZ. Recent evidence indicates that FtsA and FtsZ regulate each other's oligomeric state in E. coli to control the progression of cytokinesis, including the recruitment of septum synthesis proteins. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of protein-protein association between FtsZ and FtsA in the initial stages of divisome function, mainly in the well-characterized E. coli system. © 2018 Krupka M and Margolin W.",bacterial protein; FtsA protein; FtsZ protein; oligomer; polymer; protein ZapA; protein ZapC; protein ZapD; tubulin; unclassified drug; amino acid substitution; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial cell; binding affinity; cell division; cytokinesis; depolymerization; Escherichia coli; heat sensitivity; lipid membrane; nonhuman; oligomerization; protein binding; protein function; protein polymerization; protein protein interaction; Review; Streptococcus pneumoniae

DEDTP dimerizes upon electrochemical oxidation at a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), but the current corresponding to this oxidation is rather small for analytical purpose. A Tosflex polymer film modified glassy carbon electrode (TFGCE) was fabricated to improve the detection of DEDTP. In a pH 5.5 solution, DEDTP deprotonated to DEDTP- anion which was accumulated onto TFGCE by the anion-exchange feature of Tosflex followed by square-wave voltammetric determination. With 3 min accumulation, the analytical signal versus concentration dependence was linear from 2 ppb (1.07 × 10-8 M) to 400 ppb (2.16 × 10-6 M) with a regression coefficient of 0.995 and a detection limit of 0.4 ppb (2.1 × 10-9 M).

In this paper, we assess the potential risks related to the application of CCS technology and the acidification of aquatic ecosystems through CO2 enrichment. We use the multiple lines of evidence approach (LOEs) to characterize the effects of the acidification with contamination in aquatic sediments. We highlight and discuss the effects of acidification on the LOEs including contamination and mobility of contaminants in sediments, toxicity, macrobenthic community structure, in situ effects, and bioaccumulation-biomagnification processes. We further assess the results of acidification on the toxicity of organic contaminants such as antibiotics or illicit drugs like the freebase form of cocaine (crack). The main goal of using the LOE approach is to distinguish between adverse effects that are associated with contaminants and those related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 as a result of CCS technology. Previous assessments were not designed or conducted to incorporate an integrative point of view, nor did they employ a weight of evidence approach (WOE) in risk characterization and management of CCS operations and other situations related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 in the aquatic ecosystem. Based on the findings of this review, the WOE can identify the effects of the acidification on the different LOEs used for sediment quality: contaminant mobility, the adverse effects in organism under laboratory and field conditions, and the bioaccumulation-biomagnification of contaminants. The main strength in using the WOE is the ability of this method to discriminate between LOE responses associated with contamination by different organic and inorganic substances from those related to CO2 acidification itself. The WOE will significantly improve the risk assessment in areas affected by potential leakages of CO2 during CCS operations. © 2019 Published by NRC Research Press.",Acidification; Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric chemistry; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Contamination; Greenhouse gases; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sedimentology; Sediments; Toxicity; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Bioavailability; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Emerging pollutants; Integrative assessment; Technological development; Weight of evidence approach; Weight of evidences; Carbon capture

Tetracycline has been widely used for decades in human and veterinary medicines, with incremental residues in the environment and adverse influences on living organisms. In the present study, the genetic toxicity of tetracycline was investigated using a bioassay method with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root-meristem cells at a concentration range of 0.25-300 mg L-1 and exposure times of 24, 48, and 72 h. The results indicated that tetracycline at lower concentrations (0.25-1 mg L-1) stimulated cell mitotic division, whereas at 50-300 mg L-1 concentration caused a concentration-related decrease in mitotic index (MI). The lower tetracycline concentrations induced a slight increase in the frequency of micronucleus (MN), chromosomal aberration (CA), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in wheat root tips. However, there were significant increases in these indices at higher concentrations in concentration- and time-dependent manners, including the frequencies of MN (25-200 mg L-1), CA (10-200 mg L-1), and SCE (5-200 mg L-1), respectively. The inducement of MN, CA, and SCE decreased at 250 and 300 mg L-1 due to acute cell toxicity for all tested times. Comparatively, SCE was the most sensitive, followed by CA, with MN the least sensitive to the genotoxicity of tetracycline in wheat. These results imply that tetracycline may be genotoxic to plant cells, and exposure to tetracycline may pose a genotoxic risk to living organisms. The results also suggest that the wheat bioassay was efficient, simple, and reproducible in monitoring the genotoxicity of tetracycline in the environment. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Chromosomal aberration; Cytogenetic damage; Emerging pollutants; Genetic toxicity; Micronucleus; Mitotic index; Root-meristem cell; Sister chromatid exchange; Tetracycline; Wheat bioassay; Biology; Chromosomes; Concentration (process); Pollution; Toxicity; Veterinary medicine; Bioassay; tetracycline; antibiotics; bioassay; concentration (composition); environmental issue; genotoxicity; organic pollutant; pollution exposure; risk factor; root system; toxicity test; wheat; bioassay; chromosome aberration; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cytotoxicity; genotoxicity; meristem; micronucleus; mitosis index; nonhuman; plant root; pollutant; priority journal; review; sister chromatid exchange; wheat; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA Damage; Humans; Meristem; Micronucleus Tests; Mitosis; Mitotic Index; Mutagens; Sister Chromatid Exchange; Soil Pollutants; Tetracycline; Triticum; Triticum aestivum

We conducted a rapid systematic review on breastfeeding practices and serum concentrations of PFASs—specifically PFOS and PFOA—among reproductive-aged women and young children using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology. Recent findings: We included 14 studies examining associations between breastfeeding and PFASs in infants/toddlers or pregnant/postnatal women. Breastfeeding was significantly associated with lower PFASs exposure among women and higher PFASs exposure among children. Summary: We concluded there was “sufficient” evidence supporting an association between breastfeeding and serum PFASs concentrations among women, and “limited” evidence of an association among children due to issues with sample size, confounding, and exposure assessment. These findings reinforce that lactation is an important excretion route of PFASs for women, and that breast milk may be an important exposure pathway for young children. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; adult; analysis; blood; breast feeding; breast milk; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; metabolism; pregnancy; Adult; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Breast Feeding; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant; Milk, Human; Pregnancy"

Although partially or not yet regulated or monitored, there is growing research interest in these EPs among the scientific community because of their bioaccumulation, persistence, and adverse effects. Among these, endocrine disruptors, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals can have harmful impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not effective in removing these contaminants, allowing them to be released into the receiving environment. In order to improve the understanding of emerging pollutants, this review discusses the source, occurrence, and impacts of bisphenol A, atrazine, amoxicillin, and paracetamol as model molecules of emerging environmental pollutants, an issue that remains underrepresented in Morocco. Then, treatment methods for EPs are reviewed, including adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, biodegradation, and hybrid treatment. It is proposed that adsorption and photocatalysis can be used as simple, effective, and environmentally friendly technologies for their removal.

Because of the strong electrophilicity, high oxidizing properties, low toxicity, air and moisture stability, ready availability, ease of handling, and mild reaction conditions, the hypervalent iodine reagents have been widely utilized in modern organic chemistry. In particular, the use of hypervalent iodine reagents to initiate the C−F and C−Rfn (Rfn=CF2H, CF3, perfluoroalkyl, OCH2CF3, SCF3, SeCF3 and etc) bond formation has been increasingly developed. In these reactions, hypervalent iodine compounds behave as powerful oxidants or electrophiles and activate the fluorination/fluoroalkylation reagents, the transition-metal catalysts, or the substrates to in situ form electrophilic or radical intermediates, which subsequently participate in fluorination, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylation, perfluoroalkylation, trifluoroethoxylation, fluoroalkylthiolation, trifluoromethylselenolation and others under mild conditions. Although great achievements have been made in this area, they are just the initial phase and still require a wide scope for improvement. It is anticipated that this review will draw much attention from the organic chemistry community and inspire more contributions in the development of new hypervalent-iodine-mediated fluorination and fluoroalkylation reactions.

The response of the human host to infectious agents forms a double edged sword of immunity. The immune system has to keep a tight balance between attack on foreign surfaces and protection of host surfaces. In its proper function the immune response is aimed to recognize, attack and eliminate invading infectious agents and this response is beneficial for the host. However when the activated immune response like the complement system is not properly controlled and deregulated, effector compounds can attack and damage self-surfaces and this results in disease. In addition pathogens which cause infections and disease protect themselves from the damaging and harmful host immune weapon and use specific immune escape strategies. The complement system forms the first defense line of innate immunity and aids in the elimination of microbes and modified self-cells. Defective regulation of this cascade type system results in infections and in pathology. This can result in diseases, like severe renal diseases hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and dense deposit disease (DDD), in age related macular degeneration a common form of blindness and also in other forms of autoimmune diseases. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

EDs mimic naturally occurring hormones like estrogens and androgens which can in turn interfere with the endocrine system. As a consequence, EDs affect human reproduction as well as post and pre-natal development. In fact, infants can be affected already at prenatal level due to maternal exposure to EDs. In particular, great attention has been given to those chemicals, or their metabolites, that have estrogenic properties or antagonistic effects on the activity of androgen or even inhibiting their production. These compounds have therefore the potential of interfering with important physiological processes, such as masculinization, morphological development of the urogenital system and secondary sexual traits. Animal and in vitro studies have supported the conclusion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals affect the hormone-dependent pathways responsible for male gonadal development, either through direct interaction with hormone receptors or via epigenetic and cell-cycle regulatory modes of action. In human populations, epidemiological studies have reported an overall decline of male fertility and an increased incidence of diseases or congenital malformations of the male reproductive system. The majority of studies point towards an association between exposure to EDs and male and/or female reproductive system disorders, such as infertility, endometriosis, breast cancer, testicular cancer, poor sperm quality and/or function. Despite promising discoveries, a causal relationship between the reproductive disorders and exposure to specific toxicants has yet to be established, due to the complexity of the clinical protocols used, the degree of occupational or environmental exposure, the determination of the variables measured and the sample size of the subjects examined. Despite the lack of consistency in the results of so many studies investigating endocrine-disrupting properties of many different classes of chemicals, the overall conclusion points toward a positive association between exposure to EDs and reproductive system. Future studies should focus on a uniform systems to examine human populations with regard to the exposure to specific EDs and the direct effect on the reproductive system. © 2019 The Author(s).","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzylbutyl phthalate; cadmium; di (2 ethylhexyl) phthalate; fluorinated hydrocarbon; organophosphate pesticide; perfluoroalkyl compound; phthalic acid; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; phthalic acid diethyl ester; unclassified drug; endocrine disruptor; biological model; endocrine function; environmental exposure; epidemiology; experimental study; food contamination; food quality; human; male fertility; nonhuman; Review; soil pollution; sperm quality; water pollution; water quality; analysis; drug effect; male; male infertility; observational study; pollutant; sexual development; sperm; toxicity; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Food Contamination; Food Quality; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Observational Studies as Topic; Semen; Sexual Development"

In this context, the article reviews the occurrence, transport, fate, and electrochemical removal of some selected NSAIDs (diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NPX)) using carbon-based anodes in the aquatic environment. However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992–27,061 µg/L (influent wastewater) and 1208–7943 µg/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4–89%, 8–100%, 16–100%, and 17–98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81–95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94–98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs. However, boron-doped diamond and graphite have presented reliable applications for the complete removal of NSAIDs from wastewater samples or their aqueous solution. © 2022 by the authors.",NA

Opponents are concerned about exposure to hazardous chemicals leaching from the crumb rubber cushioning fill made of recycled tires, the plastic carpet, and other synthetic components. Numerous studies have shown that chemicals identified in artificial turf, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are known carcinogens, neurotoxicants, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors. However, few studies have looked directly at health outcomes of exposure to these chemicals in the context of artificial turf. Ecotoxicology studies in invertebrates exposed to crumb rubber have identified risks to organisms whose habitats have been contaminated by artificial turf. Chicken eggs injected with crumb rubber leachate also showed impaired development and endocrine disruption. The only human epidemiology studies conducted related to artificial turf have been highly limited in design, focusing on cancer incidence. In addition, government agencies have begun their own risk assessment studies to aid community decisions. Additional studies in in vitro and in vivo translational models, ecotoxicological systems, and human epidemiology are strongly needed to consider exposure from both field use and runoff, components other than crumb rubber, sensitive windows of development, and additional physiological endpoints. Identification of potential health effects from exposures due to spending time at artificial turf fields and adjacent environments that may be contaminated by runoff will aid in risk assessment and community decision making on the use of artificial turf. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Animals; Chemicals; Decision making; Endocrine disrupters; Esters; Health; Physiological models; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Runoff; Artificial turfs; Crumb rubber; Endocrine disruption; Environmental exposure; Hazardous chemicals; Health impact; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Phthalates; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Risks assessments; Risk assessment; carcinogen; endocrine disruptor; mutagenic agent; neurotoxin; phthalic acid ester; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; rubber; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; rubber; concentration (composition); endocrine disruptor; future prospect; health impact; organofluorine; PAH; pollution exposure; risk assessment; toxicity; artificial turf; cancer incidence; chemical composition; chicken; community; cytotoxicity; dangerous goods; developmental toxicity; ecotoxicity; ecotoxicology; egg; endocrine disease; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental decision making; environmental exposure; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; invertebrate; nonhuman; pollution; Review; risk assessment; species habitat; vertebrate; recycling; Environmental Exposure; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Recycling; Rubber

PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Carboxylation; Industrial chemicals; Organic chemicals; Sedimentation; Sediments; Chemical and biological degradation; Consumer applications; Industrial activities; Laurentian Great Lakes; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Spatial and temporal variability; Wastewater discharge; Lakes; alkyl group; carboxylic acid derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl carboxylate; perfluoroalkyl sulfonate; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; water; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; biota; bird; concentration (parameter); fish; herring; lake; lake trout; Neovison vison; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; sediment; animal; Charadriiformes; chemistry; environmental monitoring; lake; metabolism; procedures; salmonine; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; water pollutant; Animals; Carboxylic Acids; Charadriiformes; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Geologic Sediments; Great Lakes Region; Lakes; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Trout; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

Several products have completed safety trials and are presently undergoing investigation for their efficacy. In the near future, the clinician will likely employ these products in the management of a variety of patient populations. Though similar in their oxygen carrying capacity, each agent possesses distinct physiologic effects. Understanding of the benefits and shortcomings of the various compounds is essential in order to optimally utilize them in various clinical settings. This review provides an overview of recent developments in the field of oxygen therapeutics and highlights results of clinical trials. Recent findings: Modified hemoglobin solutions of human or bovine origin and perfluorochemical- based emulsions are in advanced stages of clinical testing. Bovine hemoglobin-based solutions have been associated with vascular reactivity, methemoglobin formation and development of antibodies. Larger safety trials are necessary before they can find widespread use. Polymerized human hemoglobin solutions have a favorable safety profile in early trials and have been effective as a resuscitation fluid in circumstances when red cells may be unavailable. Unfortunately, outdated human blood, the substrate for this product, is itself in short supply. Perfluorocarbons similarly reduce the need for allogeneic transfusion, but the need for high-inspired oxygen levels currently limits use. Recombinant, polymer-encapsulated and additional forms of chemically modified hemoglobins are being developed and are undergoing testing in animal models. Summary: Oxygen carriers offer a viable alternative to allogeneic transfusion. All oxygen therapeutic agents are not clinically equivalent. Optimal utilization requires a thorough understanding of the therapeutic potentials and adverse effects of the solution being considered for use. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",antibody; blood substitute; diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin; fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; hemospan; hemotech; hemozyme; methemoglobin; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctyl bromide; polymer; polymerized hemoglobin; recombinant hemoglobin; bioavailability; blood transfusion; blood vessel reactivity; clinical trial; erythrocyte; human; oxygen therapy; oxygen transport; priority journal; resuscitation; review; safety

However, the heat transfer limitation of the fixed-bed reactor greatly threatens the safe operation of the reactor and modifies the overall products selectivity on account of the strong exothermic property of FTS. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the heat transfer for FTS in the fixed-bed reactor. In this review, the utilizations of the structured catalysts as well as the high thermal conductive carbon and silicon carbide supported cobalt catalysts to improve the heat transfer for FTS are summarized. More importantly, the research progress on the utilization of the novel, high thermal conductive Al2O3@Al as support for the cobalt-based FTS is emphatically introduced. It demonstrates that the heat transfer efficiency value keff of the reactor bed packed with the Co/Al2O3@Al catalysts is 2–3 times higher than that of the conventional Co/Al2O3. As a consequence, the heavy hydrocarbon selectivity is significantly increased for Co/Al2O3@Al, which makes it very promising for industrial application. The possible technical problems in large-scale industrial applications and their solutions over the Co/Al2O3@Al are also prospected in this review. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Catalyst supports; Chemical reactors; Cobalt; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Hydrocarbons; Silicon carbide; Thermal conductivity; Al composites; Al2O3@al composite; Cobalt-based; Fixed bed reactor; Fixed-bed reactors; Heat transfer limitation; High thermal; Product selectivities; Safe operation; Supported cobalt catalyst; Heat transfer

This article reviews traditional and developing processes for pretreatment of cobalt catalysts with reference to their application in FTS. The activation atmosphere, drying, calcination, reduction conditions and type of support are critical factors that govern the reducibility, dispersion and crystallite size of the active phase. Compared to traditional high temperature H2 activation, both hydrogenation-carbidisation-hydrogenation and reduction-oxidation-reduction pretreatment cycles result in improved metal dispersion and exhibit much higher FTS activity. Cobalt carbide (Co2C) formed by CO treatment has the potential to provide a simpler and more effective way of producing lower olefins, and higher alcohols directly from syngas.

Genetic complementation analysis of these mutants has been based on cell fusion and complementation of cell killing by X ray, whereas complementation of RDS after γ rays has led to false results among AT cell lines and could not also be used in rodent cells. Studies on the relationship between cell killing and RDS following γ irradiation have indicated that (a) RDS is not responsible for cell killing and (b) DNA replication in response to γ rays is controlled by several genes. Complementation groups established in rodent cell mutants have led to the identification of the gene function in several mutants, and remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of DSB repair and its involvement in V(D)J recombination. The remaining complementation groups of X ray sensitive mutants await the determination of the role of the defective genes in the pathways operating in mammalian cells against ionizing radiation. One group of rodent mutants seems to be defective in the gene homologous to the ATM gene, and so far no more human counterparts have been found among rodent mutants. Newly characterized mutants, V-C8 and UV40, showed combined features of several human disorders, suggesting that their defective gene products could be involved in several pathways handling the response to DNA damage.",phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; ataxia telangiectasia; cancer susceptibility; chromosome 14; chromosome 7; dna replication; dna strand breakage; dna synthesis; genetic complementation; genetic stability; human; ionizing radiation; nijmegen breakage syndrome; nonhuman; priority journal; radiosensitivity; review; syndrome; Animals; Ataxia Telangiectasia; Cell Line; Chromosome Aberrations; DNA; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Genetic Complementation Test; Growth Disorders; Humans; Mammals; Mice; Microcephaly; Mutation; Syndrome

Since the soil environment has become a significant sink for PFCs, the toxicological assessment about their potential effects on terrestrial organisms is necessary. This review compiles the toxicity researches of regular and emerging PFCs on classical terrestrial biota i.e. microorganisms, earthworms, and plants. In the soil environment, the bioavailability of PFCs much depends on their adsorption in soil, which is affected by soil properties and PFCs structure. By the exploration of bacterial community richness and structure, the gene expression, the influences of PFCs on soil microorganisms were revealed; while the plants and earthworms manifested the PFCs disruption not only through macroscopic indicators, but also from molecular and metabolite responses. Basically, the addition of PFCs would accelerate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in terrestrial organisms, while the excessive ROS could not be eliminated by the defense system causing oxidative damage. Nowadays, the PFCs toxic mechanisms discussed are limited to a single strain, Escherichia coli; thus, the complexity of the soil environment demands further in-depth researches.

NRs orchestrate complex events such as development, organ homeostasis, metabolism, immune function, and reproduction. Approximately one-half of the 48 human NRs have been shown to act as ligand-regulated transcription factors and respond directly to a large variety of endogenous hormones and metabolites that are generally hydrophobic and small in size (eg, retinoic acid or estradiol). The second half of the NR family comprises the so-called orphan receptors, for which regulatory ligands are still unknown or may not exist despite the presence of a C-terminal ligand-binding domain, which is the hallmark of all NRs. Several chemicals released into the environment (eg, bisphenols, phthalates, parabens, etc) share some physicochemical properties with natural ligands, allowing them to bind to NRs and activate or inhibit their action. Collectively referred to as endocrine disruptors or endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), these environmental pollutants are highly suspected to cause a wide range of developmental, reproductive, neurological, or metabolic defects in humans and wildlife. Crystallographic studies are revealing unanticipated mechanisms by which chemically diverse EDCs interact with the ligand-binding domain of NRs. These studies thereby provide a rational basis for designing novel chemicals with lower impacts on human and animal health.

This review shows that in the crystal structures of fluorinated derivatives of the Group 15 atoms, close contacts between Group 15 atoms and negative sites (e.g. lone pair possessing atoms and anions) are quite common. These close contacts are taken as indications of attractive interactions. The collection of single crystal X-ray structures analysed in this paper demonstrates that the ability of fluorinated atoms of Group 15 to work as electrophilic sites, namely to function as pnictogen bond donors, is fairly general. The directionalities and separations of these pninctogen bonds are convincing experimental evidences that linking a fluorine to a pnictogen atom increases its electrophilicity to the point that pnictogen bonding formation may become a determinant of the lattice structures in crystalline solids. Pnictogen bonding formation may become an heuristic principle for predicting some of the short contacts that are present in the crystal structures of compounds containing fluorinated atoms of Group 15, particularly when polyfluorinated. Pnictogen derivatives containing other moieties may also work as effective electrophilic sites and a convenient design of the used tectons may allow pnictogen bond to become a general and reliable tool in crystal engineering. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",NA

Members of the Alicycliphilus genus are environmental bacteria mostly found in polluted sites such as landfills and contaminated watercourses, and in sewage sludges from wastewater treatment plants. They exhibit a versatile metabolism and the ability to use oxygen, nitrate and chlorate as terminal electron acceptors, which allow them to biodegrade xenobiotics under oxic or anoxic conditions. Pure cultures of Alicycliphilus strains are able to biodegrade some pollutants such as industrial solvents (acetone, cyclohexanol and N-methylpyrrolidone), aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene and anthracene), as well as polyurethane varnishes and foams, and they can even transform Cr(VI) to Cr(III). In addition, Alicycliphilus has also been identified in bacterial communities involved in wastewater treatment plants for denitrification, and the degradation of emerging pollutants such as triclosan, nonylphenol, N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds (indole and quinoline), and antibiotics (tetracycline and oxytetracycline). This work summarizes the current knowledge on the Alicycliphilus genus, describing its different metabolic characteristics, focusing on its xenobiotic biodegradation abilities and examining the distinct pathways and molecular bases that sustain them. We also discuss the progress made in genetic manipulation and ‘omics’ analyses, as well as Alicycliphilus participation in novel bioremediation strategies. © 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology","1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone; acetone; anthracene; aromatic hydrocarbon; benzene; chlorate; cyclohexanol; nitrate; nonylphenol; oxygen; polyurethan; RNA 16S; tamsulosin; toluene; triclosan; xenobiotic agent; nitric acid derivative; xenobiotic agent; bacterium; biodegradation; bioremediation; chemical pollutant; environmental conditions; knowledge; molecular analysis; pollutant removal; wastewater treatment; xenobiotics; activated sludge; Alicycliphilus; biodegradation; bioremediation; carbon source; Comamonadaceae; degradation; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; denitrification; DNA base composition; enrichment culture; gene sequence; genetic code; genetic manipulation; high throughput sequencing; landfill; microbial community; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; Review; waste water treatment plant; bacterial genome; bioremediation; classification; Comamonadaceae; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; pollutant; sewage; Alicycliphilus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Biodegradation, Environmental; Chlorates; Comamonadaceae; Environmental Pollutants; Genome, Bacterial; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Nitrates; Oxygen; Sewage; Xenobiotics"
Sotoodeh K.,A Review of Valve Stem Sealing to Prevent Leakage from the Valve and Its Effect on Valve Operation,2020,10.1007/s11668-020-01050-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094614915&doi=10.1007%2fs11668-020-01050-1&partnerID=40&md5=1b7170da6a0dfba429805bfcacac796c,"Stem sealing plays an important role in valve operation, to avoid leakage from the valve stem area to the environment. Additionally, accuracy and tight sealing of stem seals are vital in fugitive emission applications where hazardous fluids such as gases or vapours may escape if a valve is not sealed properly. Soft thermoplastic and elastomer materials such as Teflon (PTFE), lip seal, V-pack, Viton as well as graphite or graphoil can be used for valve stem sealing. Appropriate stem sealing or packing depends on the process conditions where the valve will be used, including being able to withstand extreme temperatures, being resistant to aggressive fluid such as H 2S containing fluid, displaying a low friction factor to the stem, providing very good sealing capability to prevent leakage from the valve stem area, and being adequately strong and economical. The sealing capability of compression packing is defined as the ability to expand laterally against the stem and stuffing box wall when stressed by tightening the gland. The stem sealing arrangement depends on the type of valves being used and the applications. The sealing capability and performance of a valve can be validated by testing the valve stem sealing through mechanical and temperature cycles based on different American Petroleum Institute standards or by finite element analysis. The torque required to operate a valve depends on parameters such as the packing or stem sealing material, number of stem sealing rings, load of gland flange, stem surface finish, temperature, and cycling. Reducing the number of packing rings can reduce the valve torque and the actuator sizing but removing rings can also increase the risk of leakage from the valve and reduce the effectiveness of the valve seals. © 2020, ASM International.",Hydrogen sulfide; Petroleum analysis; Valves (mechanical); American Petroleum Institute standards; Elastomer materials; Extreme temperatures; Fugitive emissions; Packing rings; Process condition; Temperature cycles; Valve operation; Packing

These microbial by-products are harmful compounds that can be present in various environments including air, water, soil, and other ecosystems which were discussed in detail in this review. Environmental and occupational exposure caused by endotoxin occurs in water and wastewater treatment plants, industrial plants, farming, waste recovery, and composting facilities. Even though the health risk related to endotoxin injection in intravenous and dialysis are well identified, the harmful effects of ingestion, inhalation, and other way of exposure are not well quantified and there is insufficient information on the potential health risks of endotoxins exposure in water environments, and another exposure. Because of limited studies, the outbreaks of diseases related to endotoxins in the various source of exposure not been well documented. Endotoxin removal from different environments are investigated in this review. The results of various studies have shown that conventional treatment methods have been unable to remove endotoxins from water and wastewater, therefore, monitoring the effectiveness of these processes in controlling this contaminant and also using the appropriate removal method is essential. However, management of water and wastewater treatment processes and the use of advanced processes such as Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) can be effective in monitoring and reducing endotoxin levels during water and wastewater treatment. One of the limitations of endotoxin monitoring is the lack of sufficient information to develop monitoring levels. In addition, the lack of guidelines and methods of controlling them at high levels may cause irreparable disaster. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental technology; Health; Health risks; Industrial plants; Industrial waste treatment; Industrial water treatment; Process control; Wastewater treatment; Air-water; Bacterial endotoxins; Environmental exposure; Gram-negative bacteria; Health effects; Outer membrane; Remediation technologies; Removal technology; Water and wastewater; Water and wastewater treatments; Bacteria; drinking water; endotoxin; endotoxin; water; bacterium; health impact; occupational exposure; remediation; toxin; wastewater treatment; air pollution; ecosystem restoration; environmental exposure; health care facility; nonhuman; occupational exposure; oxidation; Review; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water recycling; wastewater; water pollution; air pollutant; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; hemodialysis; procedures; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Ecosystem; Endotoxins; Environmental Monitoring; Renal Dialysis; Waste Water; Water"

Many studies have reported the association between PFCs exposure with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, those reports are still debatable, due to their findings. Thus, this review paper aimed to analyse the association of PFCs compound with CVDs and their risk factors in humans by systematic review and meta‐analysis. Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched for PFCs studies on CVDs and their risk from 2009 until present. The association of PFCs exposure with the prevalence of CVDs and their risk factors were assessed by calculating the quality criteria, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CVDs risk factors were divided into serum lipid profile (main risk factor) and other known risk factors. The meta‐analysis was then used to derive a combined OR test for heterogeneity in findings between studies. Twenty‐nine articles were included. Our meta‐analysis indicated that PFCs exposure could be associated with CVDs (Test for overall effect: z= 2.2, p = 0.02; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 91.6%, CI = 0.92–1.58, p &lt; 0.0001) and their risk factors (Test for overall effect: z= 4.03, p &lt; 0.0001; Test for heterogeneity: I2 = 85.8%, CI = 1.00– 1.14, p &lt; 0.0001). In serum lipids, total cholesterol levels are frequently reported associated with the exposure of PFCs. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure increased the risk of CVDs than other types of PFCs. Although the risk of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with CVDs and their risk factors, more observational studies shall be carried out to identify the long‐term effects of these contaminants in premature CVDs development in patients. © 2021 by the authors.

These phases have also been successfully used in sample preparation techniques, mainly in solid phase extraction (SPE). Although alkyl bonded phases (e.g., C2, C8, and C18) are the most widely used packings in RP HPLC and SPE, various specific applications require CBPs with polar functional groups (e.g., -NH2, -NO2, - CN, and/or -OH). The solution of problems with separation of complicated chiral compounds was attempted by applying stationary phases with chiral selectors (e.g., cyclodextrins, Pirkle phases, crown ethers, etc.). On the other hand, packings with pseudo-membrane or liquid crystal properties have been utilized for the separation of various substances of natural origin. Porous silica is commonly used as a support in the preparation of CBPs. Its physico-chemical characteristics, such as: type and structure of siliceous matrix, porosity, type and concentration of silanol groups, as well as surface purity, strongly influence the density and structure of chemically bonded phases. Recognition of these properties is helpful in optimizing separation processes based on RP HPLC elution and/or extraction of substances with polar character.",silica gel; silicon dioxide; adsorption; analytic method; desorption; liquid chromatography; particle size; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; reversed phase liquid chromatography; review; surface property

The perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs) are persistent emerging pollutants that are now being recognized as important human health hazards. Although the PFASs have been produced for over 60 years, academic research on environmental health aspects has appeared only in the most recent 10 years or so. In the meantime, these persistent chemicals accumulated in the global environment. Some early studies e.g., on population exposures and toxicity, were not released to the public until after year 2000. Still, the first PFAS risk assessments ignored these reports and relied on scant journal publications. The first guidelines and legal limits for PFAS exposure, e.g., from drinking water, were proposed 10 years ago. They have decreased substantially since then, but remain higher than suggested by data on human adverse effects, especially on the immune system, that occur at background exposure levels. By now, the best-known PFASs are being phased out, and related PFASs are being introduced as substitutes. Given the substantial delays in discovery of PFAS toxicity, in dissemination of findings, and in regulatory decisions, PFAS substitutes and other persistent industrial chemicals should be subjected to prior scrutiny before widespread usage. © 2018 The Author(s).",drinking water; perfluorinated alkylate substance; perfluoro compound; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; academic research; chemical pollutant; chemical substance; ecosystem health; health risk; immune system; pollution exposure; public health; toxicity; antibody titer; case study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental health; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; mortality; nonhuman; population exposure; priority journal; public health; Review; risk assessment; therapy delay; analysis; environmental monitoring; pollutant; toxicity; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans

Currently, PFOA and PFOS have been listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and their production has been halted in many countries. However, because the high-energy carbon-fluorine bond can make it resistant to hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation, and vertebrate metabolism, PFOA and PFOS show environmental persistence and bioaccumulation and hence, are of great concern to humans and wildlife. PFOA and PFOS have toxic effects on the immune system of the body. This article reviewed the effects of PFOA and PFOS on immune organs such as the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus of mice and zebrafish, and the effects on non-specific immune functions such as the skin barrier, intestinal mucosal barrier, and humoral immunity. We also reviewed the influence of specific immune functions based on cellular immunity, and further summarized the possible immune toxicity mechanisms such as AIM2 inflammasome activation, gene dysregulation, and signal pathway disorders caused by PFOA and PFOS.

As consequence, these substances have to be chemically monitored at the level of their environmental quality standards, which can be challenging. This project aimed to identify reliable effect-based methods (EBMs) for screening of endocrine disrupting compounds, to harmonise monitoring and data interpretation methods, and to contribute to the current WFD review process. Water and wastewater samples were collected across Europe and analysed using chemical analyses and EBMs. The results showed that 17β-estradiol equivalents were comparable among methods, while results can vary between methods based on the relative potencies for individual substances. Further, derived 17β-estradiol equivalents were highly correlated with LC-MS/MS analyses. This study shows that the inclusion of effect-based screening methods into monitoring programmes for estrogens in surface waterbodies would be a valuable complement to chemical analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Chemical analysis; Endocrine disrupters; Environmental regulations; Watches; Water conservation; Emerging pollutants; Endocrine disruption; In-vitro; Integrated effects; Science - policy interfaces; Steroid analysis; Watch list; Water assessment; Water pollution; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; estrogen; estrone; ethinylestradiol; surface water; chemical analysis; controlled study; environmental monitoring; estrogen activity; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; priority journal; Review; waste water; water analysis; water sampling

The uniqueness of these oxide materials is in their ability to harness energy in the UV/Vis range, their relative ease of synthesis, low cost, and their general high surface ratio to mass, etc. Thus, these materials have consequently drawn much profound interest in environment applications, particularly pharmaceutical drugs for photocatalytic degradation. Furthermore, the non-toxic nature of most metal oxide semiconductors means they are convenient for water treatment works, resulting in safe drinking water for humans and safe environments for aquatic mammals. Pharmaceuticals are emerging pollutants that are increasingly being found in water systems. They have been detrimental to the human and animal health. In this article, pharmaceutical drugs abatement from water via photocatalysis process using oxide-based advanced metals such as TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3,WO3, and Bi2WO6 is discussed. Degradation of various drugs at laboratory scale have been assessed and examples cited. Various approaches to metal oxides modifications and synthesis methods to improve degradation efficiency have also been discussed. Effects of experimental/operational parameters in the degradation process have been compiled and compared.

NA,Socio-Economic Status and Health: Evaluation of Human Biomonitored Chemical Exposure to Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances across Status,2018,NA,NA,"Research on the environment, health, and well-being nexus (EHWB) is shifting from a silo toward a systemic approach that includes the socio-economic context. To disentangle further the complex interplay between the socio-exposome and internal chemical exposure, we performed a meta-analysis of human biomonitoring (HBM) studies with internal exposure data on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and detailed information on risk factors, including descriptors of socio-economic status (SES) of the study population. PFASs are persistent in nature, and some have endocrine-disrupting properties. Individual studies have shown that HBM biomarker concentrations of PFASs generally increase with SES indicators, e.g., for income. Based on a meta-analysis (five studies) of the associations between PFASs and SES indicators, the magnitude of the association could be estimated. For the SES indicator income, changes in income were expressed by a factor change, which was corrected by the Gini coefficient to take into account the differences in income categories between studies, and the income range between countries. For the SES indicator education, we had to conclude that descriptors (<college, x years of study, etc.) differed too widely between studies to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the use of the uniform ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is recommended in future studies. The meta-analysis showed that a higher income is associated with a higher internal exposure to PFASs (PFOS or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOA or perfluorooctanoic acid, PFNA or perfluorononanoic acid, PFHxS or perfluorohexane sulfonate). This is opposite to the environmental justice hypothesis, referring to an inequitable distribution of detrimental environmental effects toward poor and minority communities by a practice or policy. With a doubling of the income, internal exposure increased on average by 10%–14%. Possible explanations for this difference are given, e.g., underlying differences in diet. However, other sources can also contribute, and the exact causes of SES-related differences in PFAS concentrations remain unclear. Studies are needed that include social descriptors together with lifestyle and dietary information as explanatory variables for internal chemical exposure levels. This will help clarify the underlying factors that link SES with inequity to environmental exposures, and will raise awareness and knowledge to strengthen the capacities of people and communities to advocate chemical exposure reduction in order to reduce this health inequity. © 2018 by the authors.

Using these sensitive methods, some epidemiology studies report associations between biomarkers and health outcomes at biomarker levels much below those associated with effects in animal studies. While some of these low exposure associations may arise from increased sensitivity of humans compared with animals or from species-specific responses, toxicology studies with drugs, commodity chemicals and consumer products have not generally indicated significantly greater sensitivity of humans compared with test animals for most health outcomes. In some cases, these associations may be indicative of pharmacokinetic (PK) bias, i.e., a situation where a confounding factor or the health outcome itself alters pharmacokinetic processes affecting biomarker levels. Quantitative assessment of PK bias combines PK modeling and statistical methods describing outcomes across large numbers of individuals in simulated populations. Here, we first provide background on the types of PK models that can be used for assessing biomarker levels in human population and then outline a process for considering PK bias in studies intended to assess associations between biomarkers and health outcomes at low levels of exposure. After providing this background, we work through published examples where these PK methods have been applied with several chemicals/chemical classes - polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDE) and phthalates - to assess the possibility of PK bias. Studies of the health effects of low levels of exposure will be improved by developing some confidence that PK bias did not play significant roles in the observed associations. © 2021 The Author(s)","biological marker; phthalic acid; plasticizer; polybrominated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; biological marker; diphenyl ether derivative; polychlorinated biphenyl; biomarker; drug; numerical model; PCB; phthalate; quantitative analysis; toxicology; biological monitoring; birth weight; controlled study; endometriosis; environmental exposure; human; menarche; menopause; newborn period; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; prenatal exposure; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; statistical analysis; toxicity; animal; epidemiology; pollutant; Animals; Biomarkers; Environmental Pollutants; Epidemiologic Studies; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Polychlorinated Biphenyls"

This feature article presents an overview of what is known of this reactivity, and presents a detailed discussion of the dynamics of some of those reactions that involve making and breaking chemical bonds. The article also presents recent results from a new position-sensitive coincidence spectrometer designed to study the dynamics of dication reactions by detecting, in coincidence, the pair of monocations often formed in such processes. Detecting the pair of product ions in coincidence from an individual reactive event, using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a position sensitive detector, allows their initial velocity vectors to be determined. Experiments studying the electron transfer reactions of atomic dications illustrate the feasibility of this coincidence technique and scattering diagrams obtained from studies of the Ne2+ + Ar collision system are presented. The coincidence technique is particularly suited for the study of reactions which produce three products. For such three-body reactions the coincidence experiment, unlike conventional techniques, allows the initial velocity vectors of all three products to be determined for each reactive event. Illustrative results show that the dissociative electron transfer reaction of CF32+ with Ar proceeds sequentially via the dissociation of highly excited vibrational levels of the electronic ground state of CF3+. In addition, the formation of OCF+ following collisions of CF22+ with H2O proceeds via a long-lived collision complex which decays via charge-separation to form a proton and HF-OCF+. The molecular monocation then dissociates to yield OCF+ and HF.",argon; californium; carbon dioxide; cation; fluorine; ion; isotope; neon; nitrogen; oxygen; perfluoro compound; proton; water; xenon; apparatus; assay; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical procedures; chemical reaction; dissociation; dynamics; electron; electron transport; energy; fragmentation reaction; gas; information processing; ion transport; ionization; light scattering; mass spectrometer; mass spectrometry; methodology; molecular dynamics; molecular model; molecule; review; spectrometer; spectroscopy; thermodynamics; velocity; vibration; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy

Biological activities have been studied experimentally in various laboratories, as well as data obtained using QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationships) algorithms. According to the data obtained, it was shown that polyether toxins exhibit strong antibacterial, antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumor, and other activities. Along with this, it was found that natural polyether ionophores exhibit such properties as antiparasitic, antiprotozoal, cytostatic, anti-mycoplasmal, and antieczema activities. In addition, polyethers have been found to be potential regulators of lipid metabolism or inhibitors of DNA synthesis. Further study of the mechanisms of action and the search for new polyether ionophores and their derivatives may provide more effective therapeutic natural polyether ionophores for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. For some polyether ionophores, 3D graphs are presented, which demonstrate the predicted and calculated activities.

More novel PFASs have been detected via nontarget analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Some novel PFASs had concentrations comparable to that of PFOS and PFOA. Both legacy and novel PFASs can pose a risk to human population who rely on contaminated groundwater as drinking water. Transport of PFASs to groundwater is influenced by various factors, i.e., the compound structure, the hydrochemical condition, and terrain. The exchange of PFASs between groundwater and surface water needs to be better characterized. Field monitoring, isotope tracing, nontarget screening, and modeling are useful approaches and should be integrated to get a comprehensive understanding of PFASs sources and behaviors in groundwater. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","chemical substance; detection method; drinking water; groundwater pollution; groundwater-surface water interaction; pollutant transport; residence time; water exchange; alkanesulfonic acid; drinking water; fluorocarbon; ground water; chemistry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Drinking Water; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Groundwater; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

They are structurally diverse but comprise a common chemical feature of at least one (though usually more) perfluorocarbon moiety (–CnF2n–) attached to a functional group such as a carboxylic or sulphonic acid. The strength of the Carbon-Fluorine bond means the compounds do not break down easily and can thus bioaccumulate. PFAS are of high concern to regulators and the public due to their potential toxicity and high persistence. At high exposure levels, PFAS have been implicated in a range of harmful effects on human and environmental health, particularly problems in/with development, cholesterol and endocrine disruption, immune system function, and oncogenesis. However, most environmental toxicology studies use far higher levels of PFAS than are generally found in the environment. Additionally, since the type of exposure, the PFAS used, and the organisms tested all vary between studies, so do the results. Traditional ecotoxicology studies may thus not identify PFAS effects at environmentally relevant exposures. Here we conduct a review of omics-based PFAS exposure studies using laboratory ecotoxicological methodologies and environmentally relevant exposure levels and show that common biochemical response pathways are identified in multiple studies. A major pathway identified was the pentose phosphate shunt pathway. Such molecular markers of sublethal PFAS exposure will greatly benefit accurate and effective risk assessments to ensure that new PFAS regulations can consider the full effects of PFAS exposure on environmental and human health receptors. © 2022 The Authors",Ecology; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Health risks; Industrial chemicals; Molecular biology; 'omics'; Biochemical response; Eco-toxicology; Lipidomics; Metabolomics; PFOA; PFOS; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Proteomics; Risks assessments; Risk assessment; chemical pollutant; ecotoxicology; health impact; health risk; metabolism; pollution exposure; proteomics; public health; regulatory approach; alkanesulfonic acid; biological marker; fluoride; fluorocarbon; sulfonic acid derivative; ecotoxicology; human; pollutant; risk assessment; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biomarkers; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorides; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Risk Assessment; Sulfonic Acids

Our aim is to show to the readers how polyfluorinated groups can be beneficial to the properties of pharmaceutically active compounds by highlighting the structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies that led to the selection of polyfluorinated moieties as key structural features.

Should primary prevention of cardiovascular disease be a priority in this patient? In order to answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature to inform an evidence-based clinical review. The objective was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the clinical management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Comprehensive literature searches were performed. The quality of each study was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale for randomized controlled trials, and the Downs and Black Scale for all other studies. Levels of evidence were assigned using a modified version of Sackett's scale. Our findings indicate that CVD is a critical issue in individuals with chronic SCI. Almost all risk factors for CVD are amplified in individuals with SCI, including physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, blood pressure irregularities, abnormal glycemic control, and chronic inflammation. However, there is a paucity of high-quality literature with respect to treatment outcomes in SCI-specific study populations (a total of 22 intervention studies in all of these categories combined) that allow for the development of evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations. These limitations notwithstanding, we present a series of contemporary practice suggestions with regard to CVD event risk modification in SCI patients. For optimal outcomes, health care providers should be cognizant of these heightened CVD risk factors and the resultant increased CVD morbidity and mortality in SCI patients. Despite the absence of high-quality evidence-based treatment strategies, clinicians should re-examine their own CVD risk factor treatment strategies to better reflect contemporary practice in similar high-CVD-event-risk patients and populations. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",antihypertensive agent; captopril; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nifedipine; prazosin; triacylglycerol; American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale; antihypertensive therapy; autonomic dysreflexia; bicycle ergometry; blood pressure fluctuation; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; chronic disease; chronic inflammation; clinical practice; death; dyslipidemia; electrostimulation; evidence based practice; glycemic control; health care personnel; health care quality; heart infarction; high risk patient; high risk population; human; hypertension; hypertensive crisis; immobilization; low drug dose; orthosis; orthostatic hypotension; primary prevention; randomized controlled trial (topic); rating scale; resistance training; review; spinal cord injury; traffic accident; treadmill exercise; treatment outcome; triacylglycerol blood level; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chronic Disease; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Factors; Spinal Cord Injuries

Identification of the underlying genetic defects is difficult in the majority of cases due to the variable clinical expression of the bleeding symptoms and the redundancy of platelet receptor and signalling pathways, which add to the complexity of diagnosis. The gold standard method for phenotyping platelets, light transmission aggregometry (LTA), has allowed classification of functional defects in the majority of patients referred for investigation of suspected PFDs, while DNA-based analysis has primarily played a confirmatory role and been restricted mainly to analysis of candidate genes. Recent advances in next generation sequencing have facilitated the identification of gene defects in patients with PFDs where the underlying genetic defect was previously unknown, especially when combined with genome-wide linkage analysis. These studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms controlling platelet formation and function, and it is likely that, as understanding of the relationships between platelet phenotype and genotype increases and pipelines for the interpretation of genetic variations identified in patients are developed, DNA-based analysis will play an increasingly important role in the first-line investigation of patients with PFDs. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",analytic method; DNA sequence; gene identification; gene insertion; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic screening; genetic variability; human; light transmission aggregometry; mutational analysis; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; review; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombocyte disorder; thrombocytopoiesis; bleeding; light transmission aggregometry; next generation sequencing; platelet function disorders; platelets; Blood Platelet Disorders; Blood Platelets; Genetic Testing; Humans; Phenotype

Conventional water purification systems are less efficient in removing these pollutants; therefore, innovative, and eco-friendly technologies are needed. Recently, semiconductor-supported photocatalysis has attracted attention in environmental remediation for removing EP's owing to their unique characteristics of low-cost, higher thermal and mechanical stability, and excellent pollutant removal efficiency. The charge separation and effective light absorption, particularly in the visible region, are two essential characteristics in photocatalyst which are hard to achieve. Several approaches have been adopted to enhance the charge separation and light-absorption ability in the visible range, including elemental-doping, morphology-engineering, and composite photocatalyst formation. This review concisely discusses the several recently discovered EP's, their fate and transport properties, as well as recent progress in the design and development of visible light-responsive photocatalysts for degradation of EP's. Furthermore, synthesis methods, key features such as optical properties, energy-bandgap structure, crystallinity, and surface features are emphasized in this review. The influencing process parameters, reusability, and stability of photocatalyst are also outlined. Finally, the summary and future perspectives for designing a sustainable photocatalysis system are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Crystallinity; Heterojunctions; Light; Mechanical stability; Morphology; Optical properties; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; Semiconductor doping; Water pollution; Water treatment; Aquatic environments; Charge-separation; Eco-friendly technologies; Emerging pollutants; Mxene; Pesticide visible light; Supported photocatalysis; Visible light; Visible-light-responsive; Water purification systems; Light absorption

This study presents an institutional anesthesia protocol, defines reported anesthetic considerations, and provides a comprehensive update to inform future directions of the field. Methods: An institutional ""FT Anesthesia Protocol""was developed and applied to 2 face transplants. A systematic review of 3 databases captured FTs in the peer-reviewed literature up to February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to include all clinical articles with FT recipient and/or donor-specific preoperative, intraoperative, and relevant postoperative anesthetic variables. Data charting guided a narrative synthesis, and quantitative synthesis reported variables as median (range). Results: Our institutional experience emphasizes the importance of on-site rehearsals, anticipation of patient-specific anesthetic and resuscitative requirements, and long-term pain management. Systematic search identified 1092 unique records, and 129 met inclusion criteria. Reports of 37 FTs in the literature informed the following anesthetic axes: donor pre- and intraoperative management during facial allograft procurement, recipient perioperative care, immunotherapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and pain management. Quantitative synthesis of 30 articles showed a median operative time of 18 hours (range, 9-28) and fluid replacement with 13 L (5-18) of crystalloids, 13 units (0-66) of packed red blood cells, 10 units (0-63) of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit (0-9) of platelets. Conclusions: Anesthetic considerations in FT span the continuum of care.

Given the general lack of comparability across studies in terms of design, conduct, methodology and reporting, we developed a checklist-type quality assessment scheme based on the STROBE guidelines and the proposed HONEES criteria, and conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 on neurodevelopmental and/or neurobehavioural effects following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs and PFCs. We rated 7 of the 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria as being of high quality, 7 of moderate quality and 4 of low quality. Frequently observed shortcomings were the lack of consideration of confounding factors; uncertainties regarding exposure characterization; inadequate sample size; the lack of a clear dose-response; and the representativeness/generalizability of the results. Collectively, the epidemiological evidence does currently not support a strong causal association between PBDEs and PFCs and adverse neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioural outcomes in infants and children. However, despite their limitations, the studies raise questions that require further investigation through hypothesis-driven studies using more harmonized study designs and methodologies, more detailed exposure assessments and repeated testing with larger study populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA
NA,Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and risk of diabetes: an evidence-based review,2018,NA,NA,"The purpose of this study was to review the epidemiological and experimental evidence linking background exposure to a selection of environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism. The review summarises the literature on both cross-sectional and prospective studies in humans, as well as experimental in vivo and in vitro studies. The findings were subjected to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found >40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for p,p′-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development. Best evidence exists for p,p′-DDE. For other chemicals, both prospective studies and supporting animal data are still lacking. © 2018, The Author(s).",NA

Feeding disorders require comprehensive assessment and treatment of 4 closely related, complementary domains (medical, psychosocial, and feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional complications). Previous diagnostic paradigms have, however, typically defined feeding disorders using the lens of a single professional discipline and fail to characterize associated functional limitations that are critical to plan appropriate interventions and improve quality of life. Using the framework of the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health, a unifying diagnostic term is proposed: ""Pediatric Feeding Disorder"" (PFD), defined as impaired oral intake that is not age-appropriate, and is associated with medical, nutritional, feeding skill, and/or psychosocial dysfunction. By incorporating associated functional limitations, the proposed diagnostic criteria for PFD should enable practitioners and researchers to better characterize the needs of heterogeneous patient populations, facilitate inclusion of all relevant disciplines in treatment planning, and promote the use of common, precise, terminology necessary to advance clinical practice, research, and health-care policy. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

PIM kinases are overexpressed in several hematopoietic tumors and support in vitro and in vivo malignant cell growth and survival, through cell cycle regulation and inhibition of apoptosis. PIM kinases do not have an identified regulatory domain, which means that these proteins are constitutively active once transcribed. They appear to be critical downstream effectors of important oncoproteins and, when overexpressed, can mediate drug resistance to available agents, such as rapamycin. Recent crystallography studies reveal that, unlike other kinases, they possess a hinge region, which creates a unique binding pocket for ATP, offering a target for an increasing number of potent small-molecule PIM kinase inhibitors. Preclinical studies in models of various hematologic cancers indicate that these novel agents show promising activity and some of them are currently being evaluated in a clinical setting.

A variety of contaminants have been found to affect the eel. These contaminants may cause disturbance of the immune system, the reproduction system, the nervous system and the endocrine system and effects were reported on several levels of biological organization, from subcellular, organ, individual up to even population level.

Therefore, unambiguously determining the catalytically active phase under reaction conditions remains challenging and thus a topic of debate. The active phase in cobalt-based FTS, including the reaction pathways it catalyzes, has been of industrial and academic interest for many years. It provides direct ways to control the output of the process. The delineation between an active and inactive phase is often unclear, as different phases (i.e., cobalt oxide, carbide, and metal) have different catalytic behavior.

Microbial communities can suffer serious consequences from the presence of pharmaceuticals as pollutants in the environment, which may directly impact public health and ecosystem equilibrium. Among this class of pollutants, the ones that have been studied in more detail are antibiotics.

Modern perfluorochemicals and cell-free hemoglobin solutions can be applied without prior cross-matching and are now available as stable formulations with long shelf life. Both groups of oxygen carriers have shown their effectivity and tolerability in numerous animal studies. An emulsion of perflubron which has a 60% weight/volume relation is actually undergoing phase III studies with respect to its effectivity in augmented acute normovolemic hemodilution since it has been shown to reverse hemodynamic transfusion triggers. While clinical studies with human cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb) have been stopped last year because of the results of two clinical trials showing an increased mortality in patients with stroke and multiple injury shock being treated with DCLHb in comparison with saline, a phase III study with polymerized bovine hemoglobin HBOC-201 is actually being performed in noncardiac patients with perioperative bleeding. The objective of this multicenter study is to show that treatment with HBOC-201 can reduce or avoid allogeneic RBC transfusion. Besides its use in clinical transfusion protocols, artificial oxygen carriers have a unique potential to deliver oxygen to the tissues by plasmatic transport due to its different physiology of oxygenation when compared with conventional oxygenation provided by red blood cells. Future studies must show if these modern oxygen carriers are able to improve outcome of patients with impaired perfusion and organ oxygenation.",fluorocarbon; hemoglobin; blood donor; blood transfusion; cell free system; cross linking; erythrocyte concentrate; erythrocyte transfusion; human; human cell; immunomodulation; oxygen transport; oxygenation; polymerization; review; substitution therapy

The α-alkoxy bridgehead radical species, which was designed as the radical donor of the three-component reaction, was generated from O, Se- and O, Te-acetals under two different conditions. The generated α-alkoxy bridgehead radical effectively underwent the threecomponent reaction with α,β-unsaturated ketones and allyltributyltin/aldehyde under each of the conditions, giving rise to a wide variety of multiply functionalized 2,3-trans disubstituted cyclopentenone moieties. One of the established reactions was utilized as the key assembling reaction of the ABC-tricyclic framework of resiniferatoxin. The reaction of the bridgehead radical of the highly functionalized 6-membered C-ring, the 5-membered A-ring, and an allyltributyltin derivative effectively produced the C4-branched AC-rings. The last B-ring was constructed from the coupling adduct in two steps through the 7-endo cyclization, delivering the tricyclic framework possessing the correct C8 and 9-stereocenters of resiniferatoxin. The present methods demonstrate the power of the three-component reaction using an α-alkoxy bridgehead radical in a convergent approach to the complex architectures of daphnane diterpenes. © 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","2 cyclohexenone; aldehyde; cyclopentenone; cyclopentenone derivative; electrophile; ketone derivative; radical; resiniferatoxin; diterpene; mezerein; neurotoxin; resiniferatoxin; vanilloid receptor; aldol reaction; Baeyer Villiger reaction; cyclization; diastereoisomer; drug synthesis; electrophilicity; nucleophilicity; oxidation; radical reaction; Review; saponification; stereochemistry; substitution reaction; chemistry; Euphorbiaceae; procedures; synthesis; Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic; Diterpenes; Euphorbiaceae; Neurotoxins; TRPV Cation Channels"

In terms of water treatments to eliminate organic compounds, biological treatments are the most used technique, especially the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. Unfortunately, several of these compounds such as petroleum and industrial wastes, some pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and hormonal substances appear to be refractory to such treatments and can join the different water surfaces from other natural environments especially contaminated soils. Physical and chemical treatments, in particularly the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are able to degrade some of these pollutants, but the nature and the possible effects of oxidation by-products remain controversial when complete mineralization does not occur. The aim of this article is to shed light on new and renewed biotechnological techniques recently introduced to resolve recalcitrance problem. Amending activated sludge with additional microorganisms able to produce versatile enzymes to enhance biodegradability or "" bioaugmentation"" , is gradually considered as a possible solution for the recalcitrance of Bio-Refractory Organic Compounds (Bio-ROCs).

The major groups of these proteins include the ATP-binding cassette transporters which in eukaryotes work as ATP-fuelled drug exporters and the Solute Carrier transporters, with various transport directions and mechanisms.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the key ATP-binding cassette and Solute Carrier drug transporters which have been reported to contribute to the function and/or protection of undifferentiated human stem cells and during tissue differentiation. We review the various techniques for studying transporter expression and function in stem cells, and the role of drug transporters in foetal and placental tissues is also discussed. We especially focus on the regulation of transporter expression by factors modulating cell differentiation properties and on the function of the transporters in adjustment to environmental challenges.Expert opinion: The relatively new and as yet unexplored territory of transporters in stem cell biology may rapidly expand and bring important new information regarding the metabolic and epigenetic regulation of stemness and the early differentiation properties. Drug transporters are clearly important protective and regulatory components in stem cells and differentiation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a octahydro 6 isobutyl 9 methoxy 1,4 dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4 b]indole 3 propanoic acid tert butyl ester; ABC transporter; ABC transporter A1; ABC transporter A7; ABC transporter B6; ABC transporter C8; ABC transporter C9; ABC transporter D3; bone morphogenetic protein 4; breast cancer resistance protein; carrier protein; fluorescent dye; glucose transporter 3; hoe 33342; membrane protein; messenger RNA; mitoxantrone; monoclonal antibody; multidrug resistance associated protein 1; multidrug resistance associated protein 6; multidrug resistance protein 1; organic anion transporter; organic cation transporter 2; organic cation transporter 3; retinoic acid; sodium phosphate cotransporter; thioneine; transcription factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; verapamil; ABC transporter; carrier protein; xenobiotic agent; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; cell differentiation; cell growth; confocal microscopy; drug transport; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression; human; human embryonic stem cell; immunocytochemistry; immunofluorescence test; immunohistochemistry; microarray analysis; nonhuman; placenta tissue; pluripotent stem cell; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; RNA splicing; tissue differentiation; transcription regulation; transport kinetics; Western blotting; animal; cell membrane; cytology; genetic epigenesis; metabolism; physiology; pluripotent stem cell; transport at the cellular level; Animals; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Biological Transport; Cell Differentiation; Cell Membrane; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Membrane Transport Proteins; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Xenobiotics"

This class of compounds has found its way into diverse arrays of water bodies in the environment due to their incomplete decomposition, and also the indiscriminate disposal of pharmaceutical waste from industries, farms, and medical centers. This is often through soluble reactive effluent, water run-offs due to rainfall on agricultural facilities and untreated sewages. Their concentration in the environment usually exceeds the permitted levels, which in turn leads to the possibilities of bio-magnifications and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Consequently, they constitute safety hazards and it is important to remove this class of compounds. Another concern is the development of resistance by the micro-organisms, which could render these drugs ineffective and useless if serious control is not put in place to regulate their usage and presence in the environment. Although different conventional methods are currently used in water treatment plants, the presence of pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics, has been confirmed in different recycled water meant for consumption. Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a useful technique for the mineralization of these antibiotics in water via the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis. In this review, a background study on the origin and fate of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, and the usefulness of photocatalysis (a prominent method of advanced oxidation process (AOPs)) in the mineralization of this class of pharmaceuticals into less harmful compounds is assessed. The degradation pathway of different classes of antibiotics is also discussed using specific examples of compounds in each of the classes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Agricultural robots; Biochemistry; Effluents; Mineralogy; Photocatalysis; Sewage; Wastewater disposal; Water treatment; Advanced oxidation process; Conventional methods; Degradation pathways; Emerging pollutants; Harmful compounds; Heterogeneous photocatalysis; Pharmaceutical wastes; Untreated sewage; Antibiotics; antibiotic agent; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antihypertensive agent; antiinflammatory agent; antilipemic agent; anxiolytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; sex hormone; antibiotics; catalysis; drug; heterogeneity; mineralization; oxidation; photolysis; wastewater treatment; agricultural waste; aquatic environment; bioaccumulation; drug decomposition; drug resistance; effluent; food chain; hospital waste; industrial waste; mineralization; photocatalysis; pollutant; Review; runoff; waste disposal; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; wastewater

Several treatment methods such as physical, biological and chemical processes have been explored to deal with these compounds. Current trends have shown that the destructive treatment processes, which offer degradation and mineralization of PFASs, are the most desirable process among researchers and policy makers. This article, therefore, reviews the degradation and defluorination processes, their efficiencies and the degradation mechanism of photon-based processes. It shows that high degradation and defluorination efficiency of PFASs could be achieved by photon driven processes such as photolysis, photochemical, photocatalysis and photoreduction. The efficiency of these processes is greatly influenced by the nature of light and the reactive radical generated in the system. The limitation of these processes, however, include the long reaction time required and the use of anoxic reaction conditions, which are not obtainable at ambient conditions. © 2020 The Author(s)",NA

The activation of PPAR-α by peroxisome proliferators in rats and mice may produce oxidative stress, due to the induction of enzymes like fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase (AOX) and cytochrome P-450 4A1. The effect of peroxisome proliferators on the antioxidant defense system is reviewed, as is the effect on endpoints resulting from oxidative stress that may be important in carcinogenesis, such as lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and transcription factor activation. Peroxisome proliferators clearly inhibit several enzymes in the antioxidant defense system, but studies examining effects on lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage are conflicting. There is a profound species difference in the induction of hepatocellular carcinomas by peroxisome proliferators, with rats and mice being sensitive, whereas species such as nonhuman primates and guinea pigs are not susceptible to the effects of peroxisome proliferators. The possible role of oxidative stress in these species differences is also reviewed. Overall, peroxisome proliferators produce changes in oxidative stress, but whether these changes are important in the carcinogenic process is not clear at this time.","1 mono (carboxymethylthio)tetradecane; acetylsalicylic acid; acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; antioxidant; bezafibrate; ciprofibrate; clofibrate; clofibric acid; cytochrome P450 4A1; dicamba; fenofibrate; fenoprop; fibric acid derivative; gemfibrozil; glutathione; methylclofenapate; nafenopin; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid dibutyl ester; pirinixic acid; pirinixil; prasterone; retinoid X receptor alpha; simfibrate; transcription factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antioxidant activity; carcinogenesis; DNA damage; DNA responsive element; drug metabolism; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; hepatomegaly; human; lipid peroxidation; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein induction; review; species difference; Animals; Antioxidants; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; DNA Damage; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver Neoplasms; Oxidative Stress; Peroxisome Proliferators; Transcription Factors; Cavia; Primates"

Holistic assessments of the adverse health effects and systematic elucidation of the mechanisms underlying environmental exposures are major scientific challenges with widespread societal implications. However, to date, few studies have comprehensively and simultaneously measured airborne pollutant exposures and explored the associated biomarkers in susceptible healthy elderly subjects, potentially resulting in the suboptimal assessment and management of health risks. To demonstrate the exposome paradigm, we describe the rationale and design of a comprehensive biomarker and biomonitoring panel study to systematically explore the association between individual airborne exposure and adverse health outcomes. We used a combination of personal monitoring for airborne pollutants, extensive human biomonitoring, advanced omics analysis, confounding information, and statistical methods. We established an exploratory panel study of Biomarkers of Air Pollutant Exposure in Chinese people aged 60–69 years (China BAPE), which included 76 healthy residents from a representative community in Jinan City, Shandong Province. During the period between September 2018 and January 2019, we conducted prospective longitudinal monitoring with a 3-day assessment every month. This project: (1) leveraged advanced tools for personal airborne exposure monitoring (external exposures); (2) comprehensively characterized biological samples for exogenous and endogenous compounds (e.g., targeted and untargeted monitoring) and multi-omics scale measurements to explore potential biomarkers and putative toxicity pathways; and (3) systematically evaluated the relationships between personal exposure to air pollutants, and novel biomarkers of exposures and effects using exposome-wide association study approaches. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adverse health impacts of air pollution exposures and identify potential adverse clinical outcomes that can facilitate the development of effective prevention and targeted intervention techniques. © 2021","Air pollution; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Air pollutants; Airborne pollutants; Chinese people; Exposome-wide association study; Exposomic; Metabolomics; Panel studies; Personal exposure monitoring; PM 2.5; Pollutant exposures; Biomarkers; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; aromatic hydrocarbon; biological marker; interleukin 1; interleukin 3; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; mitochondrial DNA; monoaromatic hydrocarbon; organophosphate; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid ester; polybrominated biphenyl; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; biological marker; atmospheric pollution; biomarker; biomonitoring; health risk; metabolism; panel data; particulate matter; pollution exposure; adverse outcome; aging; air pollutant; airborne particle; biochemical analysis; biological monitoring; blood sampling; cardiovascular disease; Chinese; clinical outcome; cognitive defect; documentation; endocrine disease; environmental exposure; epigenetics; exposome wide association study; human; inflammation; lipid metabolism; lipidomics; lung function; metabolomics; microbiomics; multiomics; nonhuman; oxidative stress; personal monitoring; pictorial documentation; proteomics; questionnaire; Review; telomere length; toxicity; transcriptomics; types of study; urine sampling; aged; analysis; China; environmental exposure; prospective study; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong; Aged; Air Pollutants; Biomarkers; China; Environmental Exposure; Exposome; Humans; Prospective Studies"

It is shown that depending on the substitution pattern of the allene and the borane, a surprisingly broad variety of chemical transformations can be observed. These transformations often include unexpected skeletal rearrangements of the former allene. Furthermore, some transformations require only catalytic amounts of the borane-based Lewis acid.

From an engineering point of view, the challenge is not straightforward. It is difficult to remove these contaminants from complex mixtures of substances by conventional methods used in wastewater and drinking water treatment. Ozonation and ozone-based AOPs are accepted processes of degradation of resistant substances or at least enhancement of their biodegradability. The aim of this review paper is to present research trends aimed at solving problems in the research and application of ozone-based processes in the removal of micropollutants from wastewater, thus preventing leakage of harmful substances into surface water, soil, and groundwater and facilitating the reuse of wastewater. Priority substances, micropollutants and emerging pollutants, as well as processes and technologies for their transformation and elimination, are briefly specified. Results obtained by the authors in solving research projects that were aimed at eliminating selected micropollutants by ozonation and ozone-based AOPs are also presented. This review focuses on selected alkylphenols, petroleum substances, and organochlorine pesticides. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA

There is ample evidence of substantial contamination of indoor dust with these chemicals and that their concentrations in indoor air exceed substantially those outdoors. Studies examining the relationship between body burden and exposure via indoor dust are inconsistent; while some indicate a link between body burdens and PBDE and HBCD exposure via dust ingestion, others find no correlation. Likewise, while concentrations in indoor dust and human tissues are both highly skewed, this does not necessarily imply causality. Evidence suggests exposure via dust ingestion is higher for toddlers than adults. Research priorities include identifying means of reducing indoor concentrations and indoor monitoring methods that provide the most ""biologically-relevant"" measures of exposure as well as monitoring a wider range of microenvironment categories.

As a transformation pathway, the catalytic pyrolysis of lipids can remove oxygen atoms and modify molecular structures via carbon chain cracking and aromatisation. However, this pathway has not yet been certified for the production of alternative aviation fuels. Therefore, a detailed review of various heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of lipids into hydrocarbon fuels with molecular weights and structures suitable for use in aviation is presented herein, with a focus on aspects such as their physical and chemical properties, pore distributions and structures, active sites, key functions, catalytic performance, and pyrolysis mechanisms. Metal oxides can effectively remove oxygen atoms, whereas zeolites can achieve long-carbon-chain cracking to yield desirable gasoline-, kerosene-, or diesel-range fuels. Moreover, zeolites typically permit aromatisation, which yields the aromatic hydrocarbons required for liquid fuels. Modification of the pore structures of zeolites to yield hierarchical pores can improve the production of C8–C16-range liquid fuels to maximise the bio-kerosene yield. Therefore, composite catalysts (metal oxides supported on zeolites with hierarchical pores) can be effective for molecular-level structural modification in the pyrolytic production of alternative aviation fuels using lipids. However, rapid deactivation due to coking, poisoning, and sintering hinder the operation of these catalysts. Coking, which is predominantly responsible for pyrolysis catalyst deactivation, should be targeted in future research on novel catalysts. The synthetic strategy of catalysts and the mitigation of their issues are critical to the design of novel catalytic pyrolysis systems for the efficient cracking of triglyceride-rich feedstock to yield alternative aviation fuels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst poisoning; Lipids; Liquids; Molecular oxygen; Pore structure; Sintering; Zeolites; Alternative aviation fuel; Aviation fuel; Catalytic pyrolysis; Composite catalysts; Liquid hydrocarbons; Micro-algae; Non-edible lipid; Oxygen atom; Synthetic strategies; ]+ catalyst; Microalgae

OBPP often has medicolegal implications. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland the incidence is 0.42, in the United States 1.5, and in other western countries 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. Most infants with OBPP have no known risk factors. Shoulder dystocia increases the risk for OBPP 100-fold. The reported incidence of OBPP after shoulder dystocia varies widely from 4% to 40%. Other risk factors include birth weight >4 kg, maternal diabetes mellitus, obesity or excessive weight gain, prolonged pregnancy, prolonged second stage of labor, persistent fetal malposition, operative delivery, and breech extraction of a small baby. OBPP after caesarean section accounts for 1 % to 4% of cases. Historically, OBPPs have been considered to result from excessive lateral traction and forceful deviation of the fetal head from the axial plane of the fetal body, usually in association with shoulder dystocia, which increases the necessary applied peak force and time to deliver the fetal shoulders. Direct compression of the fetal shoulder on the symphysis pubis may also cause injury. However a significant proportion of OBPPs occurs in utero, as according to some studies more than half of the cases are not associated with shoulder dystocia. Possible mechanisms of intrauterine injury include the endogenous propulsive forces of labor, intrauterine maladaptation, or failure of the shoulders to rotate, and impaction of the posterior shoulder behind the sacral promontory. Uterine anomalies, such as fibroids, an intrauterine septum, or a bicornuate uterus may also result in OBPP. It is not possible to reliably predict which fetuses will experience OBPP. Future research should be directed in prospective evaluation of the mechanisms of injury, to enable obstetricians, midwives, and other health care professionals to identify modifiable risk factors, develop preventive strategies, and improve perinatal outcomes.

Inert fluorinated gases are nontoxic, abundant, relatively inexpensive, and the technique can be performed on any MRI scanner with broadband multinuclear imaging capabilities. Pulmonary 19F MRI has been performed in animals, healthy human volunteers, and in patients with lung disease. In this review, the technical requirements of 19F MRI are discussed, along with various imaging approaches used to optimize the image quality. Lung imaging is typically performed in humans using a gas mixture containing 79% perfluoropropane (PFP) or sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and 21% oxygen. In lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF), ventilation defects are apparent in regions that the inhaled gas cannot access. 19F lung images are typically acquired in a single breath-hold, or in a time-resolved, multiple breath fashion. The former provides measurements of the ventilation defect percent (VDP), while the latter provides measurements of gas replacement (ie, fractional ventilation). Finally, preliminary comparisons with other functional lung imaging techniques are discussed, such as Fourier decomposition MRI and hyperpolarized gas MRI. Overall, functional 19F lung MRI is expected to complement existing proton-based structural imaging techniques, and the combination of structural and functional lung MRI will provide useful outcome measures in the future management of pulmonary diseases in the clinic.

Most naturally occurring bile acids belong to the 5β-series, with hydroxyl groups in the A, B, and C ring of the steroid system. Hydroxyl groups are mostly found at the C3, C6, C7, C12 and C23 positions and are α- rather than β-oriented. In most bile acids, the A/B ring junction is cis (5β-series). However, the A ring can be usually present in the more stable (chair) or less stable (boat) conformation. Both B/C and C/D ring junction are trans. With respect to the angular C19-methyl group, the hydrogen atoms at C5 and C8 are cis-oriented whereas those at C9 and C14 are trans-oriented. The archetypal bile acid is 5β-cholanic acid (3) from which all other C27 bile acids can be derived. In addition to the bile acids with 24 carbons, some naturally occurring C27 bile acids have been identified including di-, tri- and tetra-hydroxy derivatives of coprostanic acid isolated from bile of several reptile species. The most dominant bile acids and their natural sources are given and a selection of naturally occurring bile acids with unusual structures which have been mostly isolated from the bile of reptiles and amphibians is described.",bile acid; carbon; chenodeoxycholic acid derivative; cholanic acid derivative; cholic acid; cholic acid derivative; deoxycholic acid; hydrogen; hydroxyl group; hyodeoxycholic acid; lithocholic acid; methyl group; ursodeoxycholic acid; hydrogenation; nonhuman; protein conformation; protein structure; protein synthesis; review

In the flat-bottom PBR, areal biomass productivities decreased from 6.8 to 4.2 g·m−2·d−1 when the flow rate of a culture per unit of lane width was increased from 33 to 132 L·m−1·min−1. We found that this decrease in the areal productivity was the result of a decrease in the volumetric photon flux densities (volumetric PFDs), which was caused by an increase in the depth of the culture in the lane. Through CFD calculation and long-exposure photography, the flow of the culture in the wavy-bottom PBR was characterized in an upper straightforward section and underneath the swirling section. Under identical conditions of flow rate and volumetric PFD (66 L·m−1·min−1 and 50 μmol·m−3·s−1, respectively), the cell growth accelerated in the wavy-bottom PBR with areal productivity that reached 6.5 g·m−2·d−1—productivity was 5.1 g·m−2·d−1 in the flat-bottom PBR. The swirling flow in the wave troughs held the culture for longer periods in the illuminated lane, and the resultant extended period of mixing improved the photosynthetic productivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cell proliferation; Computational fluid dynamics; Mass transfer; Photobioreactors; Productivity; Biomass productivity; Cascade photobioreactor; Chlorella sorokiniana; Flow regimes; Fluid-flow; Fluid-flow regime; Photobiore-actor; Photon flux densities; Photosynthetic productivity; Volumetrics; Flow of fluids; biomass; cell growth; Chlorella sorokiniana; computational fluid dynamics; density; flow rate; fluid flow; fungal cell; fungus culture; nonhuman; photography; photon; photosynthesis; Review; volumetry

Literature reports that they are persistent and may travel considerable distances in all environmental compartments, such as water, sediment, air, and soil owing to their chemical and thermal stability. However, their transport with co-existing contaminants and their potential as vectors for various chemical and biological contaminants has been overlooked. In this sense, the present note addresses the role of PFCs as vectors, making this review one of its kind. This graphical review discusses the ability of PFCs to interact with different matrices, such as heavy metals, organic matter, and bacterial cell membranes via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and aggregation and micelle formation, allowing them to act as vectors for various chemical and biological contaminants. This PFC-mediated transport can alter the tendency of both -PFCs and the contaminant to persist, bioaccumulate, and co-transport between and within disparate environmental matrices, as well as their interfaces. Further, this joint toxicity could potentially have elevated eco-toxicological impacts, including altered cell membrane permeability and increased cell uptake, which still need to be explored, thereby demonstrating the need for future investigations in this regard. © 2022 The Authors",NA

Fluoropolymers, high molecular weight polymers, have unique properties that constitute a distinct class within the PFAS group. Fluoropolymers have thermal, chemical, photochemical, hydrolytic, oxidative, and biological stability. They have negligible residual monomer and oligomer content and low to no leachables. Fluoropolymers are practically insoluble in water and not subject to long-range transport. With a molecular weight well over 100 000 Da, fluoropolymers cannot cross the cell membrane. Fluoropolymers are not bioavailable or bioaccumulative, as evidenced by toxicology studies on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): acute and subchronic systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, local toxicity on implantation, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, hemolysis, complement activation, and thrombogenicity. Clinical studies of patients receiving permanently implanted PTFE cardiovascular medical devices demonstrate no chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity and no reproductive, developmental, or endocrine toxicity. This paper brings together fluoropolymer toxicity data, human clinical data, and physical, chemical, thermal, and biological data for review and assessment to show that fluoropolymers satisfy widely accepted assessment criteria to be considered as “polymers of low concern” (PLC). This review concludes that fluoropolymers are distinctly different from other polymeric and nonpolymeric PFAS and should be separated from them for hazard assessment or regulatory purposes. Grouping fluoropolymers with all classes of PFAS for “read across” or structure–activity relationship assessment is not scientifically appropriate.

Recent Findings: PFASs are persistent organic pollutants that have been widely produced and used in a range of commercial products since the 1950s. Human exposures to PFASs are nearly ubiquitous globally, but studies that addressed potential health effects of PFASs have only begun to accumulate in recent years. Animal studies suggest adverse effects resulting from developmental encompasses prenatal exposures to PFASs. In humans, the developing fetus is exposed to PFASs via active or passive placenta transfer, while newborns might be exposed via breastfeeding or PFAS in the home environment. Summary: Overall, epidemiological findings are consistent and suggest possible associations with fetal and postnatal growth and immune function, while the findings on neurodevelopmental endpoints to date are rather inconclusive.

The periconceptional period and intrauterine life are crucial for determining long-term susceptibility to diseases. Treatments and procedures in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adverse in-utero environments may modify the methylation levels of genomic imprinting regions, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19, mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), and paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), affecting the development of the fetus. ART, maternal psychological stress, and gestational exposures to chemicals are common stressors suspected to alter global epigenetic patterns including imprinted genes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our objective is to highlight the effect of conception mode and maternal psychological stress on fetal development. Specifically, we monitor fetal programming, regulation of imprinted genes, fetal growth, and long-term disease risk, using the imprinted genes IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 as examples. The possible role of environmental chemicals in genomic imprinting is also discussed. SEARCH METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published mostly from 2005 to 2019 was conducted using search terms IGF2/H19, MEST, PEG10, imprinted genes, DNA methylation, gene expression, and imprinting disorders (IDs). Studies focusing on maternal prenatal stress, psychological well-being, environmental chemicals, ART, and placental/fetal development were evaluated and included in this review. OUTCOMES: IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 imprinted genes have a broad developmental effect on fetal growth and birth weight variation. Their disruption is linked to pregnancy complications, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Adverse early environment has a major impact on the developing fetus, affecting mostly growth, the structure, and subsequent function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurodevelopment. Extensive evidence suggests that the gestational environment has an impact on epigenetic patterns including imprinting, which can lead to adverse long-term outcomes in the offspring. Environmental stressors such as maternal prenatal psychological stress have been found to associate with altered DNA methylation patterns in placenta and to affect fetal development. Studies conducted during the past decades have suggested that ART pregnancies are at a higher risk for a number of complications such as birth defects and IDs. ART procedures involve multiple steps that are conducted during critical windows for imprinting establishment and maintenance, necessitating long-term evaluation of children conceived through ART. Exposure to environmental chemicals can affect placental imprinting and fetal growth both in humans and in experimental animals. Therefore, their role in imprinting should be better elucidated, considering the ubiquitous exposure to these chemicals. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Dysregulation of imprinted genes is a plausible mechanism linking stressors such as maternal psychological stress, conception using ART, and chemical exposures with fetal growth. It is expected that a greater understanding of the role of imprinted genes and their regulation in fetal development will provide insights for clinical prevention and management of growth and IDs. In a broader context, evidence connecting impaired imprinted gene function to common diseases such as cancer is increasing. This implies early regulation of imprinting may enable control of long-term human health, reducing the burden of disease in the population in years to come. © 2019 The Author(s)..

Seafood consumption is thought to be an underappreciated source of PFAS exposure in the general population. This review synthesizes the current understanding of PFAS occurrence in shellfish, a term used to describe animals such as mollusk bivalves, certain gastropods (snails), cephalopods (e.g., octopuses and squid), and crustaceans, and highlights scientific gaps relative to bioaccumulation and the protection of shellfish consumers. Recent findings: A range of sampling methodologies are used across studies, and the suite of PFAS surveyed across studies is highly variable. Concentrations of PFAS observed in shellfish vary by geographic location, shellfish species, habitat, and across PFAS compounds, and studies informing estimates of bioaccumulation of PFAS in shellfish are extremely limited at this time. Summary: This review identifies several important opportunities for researchers to standardize PFAS sampling techniques, sample preparation, and analytical methodologies to allow for better comparison of PFAS analytes both within and across future studies. Increasing the range of geographic locations where samples are collected is also a critical priority to support a greater knowledge of worldwide PFAS contamination. When put into the context of risk to consumer, concentrations of PFAS, especially PFOS, found in shellfish collected from sites containing aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) and industrial contamination may present risks to frequent consumers. Further research is needed to protect shellfish consumers and to inform shellfish advisories and health protective policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",health care policy; human; Health Policy; Humans

As a self-perpetuating state of inflammatory derangement, acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS is manifest clinically as rapid development of radiographic infiltrates, severe hypoxaemia and reduced lung compliance. Over the years, researchers have made significant progress in elucidating the pathophysiology of this complex syndrome. Therapies targeting specific pathophysiologic steps in the development or persistence of this syndrome are in various stages of laboratory and clinical testing. Results to date have shown nitric oxide (NO) to improve oxygenation in the majority of patients but fail to improve mortality. Surfactant replacement has had limited success in adults, but new formulations and delivery methods may prove beneficial. Several inflammatory mediator-targeted therapies have progressed successfully through early clinical evaluation. Among these, neutrophil elastase inhibitors have shown the most promise and are currently undergoing Phase III trials. Other mediator-targeted therapies, such as prostaglandin E1, IL-10 and platelet activating factor antagonists, have not been found efficacious in large clinical trials of ARDS. However, these therapies, along with coagulation modulators, may have a favourable impact on ARDS by improving outcomes in sepsis, the greatest risk factor for developing this condition. In the interim, supportive care through improvements in mechanical ventilation are beneficial, while specific fluid balance and nutrition strategies may prove advantageous.","acetylcysteine; activated protein C; albumin; almitrine; antioxidant; artificial lung surfactant; atrial natriuretic factor; blood clotting factor; corticosteroid derivative; cyclooxygenase 1; cyclooxygenase 2; fluorocarbon; furosemide; ibuprofen; insasurf; interleukin 10; leukocyte elastase inhibitor; lisofylline; lucinactant; lung surfactant; lung surfactant extract; lusupultide; nitric oxide; perfluorooctyl bromide; phenylephrine; poloxomer 188; prostacyclin; prostaglandin E1; prostaglandin synthase inhibitor; thiazolidone; thrombocyte activating factor; thrombocyte activating factor antagonist; tissue factor pathway inhibitor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal experiment; animal model; artificial ventilation; capillary permeability; clinical laboratory; clinical research; controlled study; disease severity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug targeting; fluid balance; human; hypoxemia; inflammatory disease; lung compliance; lung edema; lung infiltrate; lung injury; mortality; nonhuman; nutrition; oxygenation; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; rat; review; risk factor; sepsis; substitution therapy; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; Acetylcysteine; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Animals; Anticoagulants; Antioxidants; Clinical Trials; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Expectorants; Hemodynamic Processes; Humans; Hydrostatic Pressure; Immunotherapy; Nutrition Physiology; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory Therapy"

The flavoring value is related to the lactones’ ring size and chain length, which blend in varying concentrations to produce different stone-fruit flavors. The nature-identical and enantiomeric pure (+)-lactones are only produced through whole-cell biotransformation of yeast. The industrially important γ-decalactone and δ-decalactone are produced by a four-step aerobic-oxidation of ricinoleic acid (RA) following the lactonization mechanism. Recently, metabolic engineering strategies have opened up new possibilities for increasing productivity. Another strategy for increasing yield is to immobilize the RA and remove lactones from the broth regularly. Besides flavor impact, γ-, δ-, ε-, ω-lactones of the carbon chain (C8-C12), the macro-lactones and their derivatives are vital in pharmaceuticals and healthcare. These analogues are isolated from natural sources or commercially produced via biotransformation and chemical synthesis processes for medicinal use or as active pharmaceutical ingredients. The various approaches to biotransformation have been discussed in this review to generate more prospects from a commercial point of view.

An overview of physicochemical properties, generation classifications of antibiotics, and different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) available for the removal of emerging pollutants are presented. Besides, the removal efficiency of diverse antibiotics by various AOPs are discussed. The combination such as UV/H2O2, UV/H2O2/Fe2+ and ozonation are reported for maximum removal of antibiotics. However, when compared to simulated wastewater, limitations are persisted for the removal of antibiotics in real wastewater, owing to its difficulty in assessing and observing the compound under mixed nature.

Neoechinulin is an indole alkaloid and has a double bond between C8/C9, which tends to contribute to its cytoprotective nature. Neoechinulin A exhibits protection to PC12 cells against nitrosative stress via increasing NAD(P)H reserve capacity and decreasing cellular GSH levels. It also confers protection via rescuing PC12 cells from rotenone-induced stress by lowering LDH leakage. This compound has great positive potential against neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting SIN-1 induced cell death in neuronal cells. Together with these, neoechinulin A tends to inhibit Aβ42-induced microglial activation and confers protection against neuroinflammation. Alongside, it also inhibits cervical cancer cells by caspase-dependent apoptosis and via upregulation of apoptosis inducing genes like Bax, it suppresses LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages and acts as an antidepressant.

PFCs are non-biodegradable and bioaccumulate in the environment and for these reasons they have been a major subject of research regarding their toxicity, environmental fate, and sources of human exposure, since they have been shown to induce severe health consequences, such as neonatal mortality, neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity. The aim of this review is to explore the existing knowledge of the interplay between PFCs exposure and human health, with a focus on male reproductive health, given the emerging gender differences in PFCs clearance and their interaction with sex hormones receptors. A comprehensive PUBMED search was performed using relevant key terms for PFCs and male fertility. Different degrees of evidence suggest an impairment of semen parameters and sex hormones in relation to PFCs exposure. These preliminary results point towards a sex-dependent pharmacodynamics and clearance, with males having a much higher tendency to accumulation. Moreover, because of the widespread environmental occurrence of these chemicals, along with their ability to cross the placental barrier, exposure of the foetus to these compounds is inevitable. This is of concern because foetal development of the male reproductive organs may be disturbed by exposure to exogenous factors. These findings clearly suggest an antiandrogenic potential of PFCs and a link between endocrine disruptors and disorders of male health. © 2017, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","organic anion transporter; perfluoro compound; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; sex hormone; endocrine disruptor; fluorinated hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; environmental exposure; half life time; health hazard; human; male fertility; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; protein function; renal clearance; Review; semen abnormality; sex difference; spermatogenesis; testis disease; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; chemically induced; drug effect; environmental exposure; health status; male; male infertility; reproduction; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Health Status; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Infertility, Male; Male; Reproduction"

Through the tube, which was continuously flushed with saline solution, a 5F Swan-Ganz catheter was introduced into the left atrium. In all cases where left atrial puncture was possible (n = 173), the left ventricle was easily entered, even in the presence of mitral stennosis.

Because this rising prevalence cannot be fully explained by traditional risk factors such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, early-life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is recognized as emerging novel risk factors for childhood obesity. EDCs can disrupt the hormone-mediated metabolic pathways, affect children’s growth and mediate the development of childhood obesity. Many organic pollutants are recently classified to be EDCs. In this review, we summarized the epidemiological and laboratory evidence related to EDCs and childhood obesity, and discussed the possible mechanisms underpinning childhood obesity and early-life exposure to non-persistent organic pollutants (phthalates, bisphenol A, triclosan) and persistent organic pollutants (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). Understanding the relationship between EDCs and childhood obesity helps to raise public awareness and formulate public health policy to protect the youth from exposure to the harmful effects of EDCs. © 2018 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzene; carbon monoxide; chlorphenotane; endocrine disruptor; estrogen; leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; phthalic acid; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; sirtuin 1; sulfur dioxide; triclosan; adipogenesis; body mass; childhood obesity; diabetes mellitus; DNA damage; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; exposure; genetic transcription; health education; homeostasis model assessment; household income; human; hypothyroidism; immunotoxicity; insulin resistance; intrauterine growth retardation; lipid peroxidation; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; oxidative stress; persistent organic pollutant; physical inactivity; prenatal exposure; Review; skin absorption; waist circumference"

No appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Methods We performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies that assessed association of environmental exposures with measures of kidney function and disease in pediatric populations. The search period went through July 2016. Results We found 50 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. Environmental exposures reviewed herein included lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, aflatoxin, melamine, environmental tobacco, bisphenol A, dental procedures, phthalates, ferfluorooctanoic acid, triclosan, and thallium/uranium. Most studies assessed environmental chemical exposure via biomarkers but four studies assessed exposure via proximity to emission source. There was mixed evidence of association between metal exposures, and other non-metal environmental exposures and pediatric kidney disease and other kidney disease biomarkers. The evaluation of causality is hampered by the small numbers of studies for each type of environmental exposure, as well as lack of study quality and limited prospective evidence.

NA,Effects of persistent organic pollutants on the developing respiratory and immune systems: A systematic review,2013,NA,NA,"Background: Disruption of developing immune and respiratory systems by early-life exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) could result into reduced capacity to fight infections and increased risk to develop allergic manifestations later in life. Objectives: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Methods: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. Results: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate. Discussion and conclusion: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA

This phenomenon is characterized by increases in the volume density and fatty acid oxidation of these organelles, which contain hydrogen peroxide and fatty acid oxidation systems important in lipid metabolism. Research showing that some peroxisome proliferating chemicals are nongenotoxic animal carcinogens stimulated interest in developing mode of action (MOA) information to understand and explain the human relevance of animal tumors associated with these chemicals. Studies have demonstrated that a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in energy homeostasis, designated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), is an obligatory factor in peroxisome proliferation in rodent hepatocytes. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the state of the science on several topics critical to evaluating the relationship between the MOA for PPARα agonists and the human relevance of related animal tumors. Topics include a review of existing tumor bioassay data, data from animal and human sources relating to the MOA for PPARα agonists in several different tissues, and case studies on the potential human relevance of the animal MOA data. The summary of existing bioassay data discloses substantial species differences in response to peroxisome proliferators in vivo, with rodents more responsive than primates. Among the rat and mouse strains tested, both males and females develop tumors in response to exposure to a wide range of chemicals including DEHP and other phthalates, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, and certain pesticides and hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals. MOA data from three different rodent tissues - rat and mouse liver, rat pancreas, and rat testis - lead to several different postulated MOAs, some beginning with PPARα activation as a causal first step. For example, studies in rodent liver identified seven ""key events,"" including three ""causal events"" - activation of PPARα, perturbation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and selective clonal expansion - and a series of associative events involving peroxisome proliferation, hepatocyte oxidative stress, and Kupffer-cell-mediated events. Similar in-depth analysis for rat Leydig-cell tumors (LCTs) posits one MOA that begins with PPARα activation in the liver, but two possible pathways, one secondary to liver induction and the other direct inhibition of testicular testosterone biosynthesis. For this tumor, both proposed pathways involve changes in the metabolism and quantity of related hormones and hormone precursors. Key events in the postulated MOA for the third tumor type, pancreatic acinar-cell tumors (PACTs) in rats, also begin with PPARα activation in the liver, followed by changes in bile synthesis and composition. Using the new human relevance framework (HRF) (see companion article), case studies involving PPARα-related tumors in each of these three tissues produced a range of outcomes, depending partly on the quality and quantity of MOA data available from laboratory animals and related information from human data sources.","antilipemic agent; bezafibrate; chlorinated hydrocarbon; ciprofibrate; clobuzarit; clofibrate; fatty acid; fenofibrate; gemfibrozil; herbicide; hormone receptor; hydrogen peroxide; methylclofenapate; nafenopin; natural product; paraffin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; phthalic acid derivative; pirinixil; plasticizer; solvent; tetrachloroethylene; tiadenol; tomelukast; trichloroacetic acid; trichloroethylene; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; carcinogen; cell receptor; DNA binding protein; nuclear protein; repressor protein; transcription factor; zinc finger protein; acinar cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; bioassay; cancer risk; cell proliferation; chemical carcinogenesis; chlorination; clonogenesis; controlled study; density; drug carcinogenicity; drug mechanism; fatty acid oxidation; female; human; human relevance; Kupffer cell; Leydig cell tumor; lipid metabolism; liver; liver cell; male; metabolic regulation; mouse; nonhuman; outcomes research; oxidative stress; pancreas; peroxisome; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; quantitative diagnosis; rat; review; selective clonal expansion; species comparison; species difference; testis; testosterone synthesis; tissue distribution; animal; cell transformation; disease model; drug effect; Leydig cell tumor; lipid peroxidation; liver tumor; metabolism; methodology; microbody; oxidation reduction reaction; pancreas tumor; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; primate; risk assessment; testis tumor; Animalia; Primates; Rodentia; Animals; Biological Assay; Carcinogens; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Disease Models, Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fatty Acids; Humans; Leydig Cell Tumor; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Microbodies; Nuclear Proteins; Oxidation-Reduction; Pancreas; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Primates; Rats; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Repressor Proteins; Risk Assessment; Testicular Neoplasms; Testis; Transcription Factors; Zinc Fingers"

Our objective was to summarize the available literature regarding its prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. Data Sources: A PubMed search was performed to include English language articles with the following search terms: pollen food syndrome, pollen food allergy syndrome, PFAS, oral allergy syndrome, OAS, food anaphylaxis, food components. Study Selections: Human articles discussing PFAS. Results: Varying reports have been made of the prevalence of PFAS, ranging from 4.7% to greater than 20% in children and 13% to 58% in adults. Prevalence varies widely by geographic region. PFAS is typically the results of class II food allergens (e.g. sensitized to anaeroallergen, but reaction occurs due to cross reactivity from a food allergen). Commonly these reactions are limited to the oropharynx due to the lability of the proteins causing the reaction. As multiple families of proteins with varying stability cause PFAS, severe systemic reactions are also possible, as anaphylactic shock has been documented in up to 1.7% of reactions. Conclusion: Pollen food allergy syndrome therefore cannot be dismissed as a benign food allergy, but it needs to be approached individually based on known risk factors. © 2019","epinephrine; immunoglobulin E; omalizumab; profilin; allergen; anaphylaxis; cross reaction; food allergy; geographic distribution; human; medical literature; nausea; pathogenesis; patient preference; physical examination; pollen allergy; pollen food allergy syndrome; prevalence; prick test; priority journal; protein degradation; quality of life; Review; subcutaneous immunotherapy; sublingual immunotherapy; symptomatology; adult; child; classification; food allergy; immunology; pathology; pollen; pollen allergy; Adult; Allergens; Child; Cross Reactions; Food Hypersensitivity; Humans; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"

In normal cell division in Escherichia coli this is accomplished by the action of the Min proteins, which maintain a high concentration of a septation inhibitor near the ends of the cell, and a low concentration at midcell. This leaves the midcell site as the only available location for formation of the division septum. In other species, such as Bacillus subtilis, this general paradigm is maintained, although some of the proteins differ and the mechanisms used to localize the proteins vary. A second mechanism of negative regulation, the nucleoid-occlusion system, prevents septa forming over nucleoids. This system functions in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and is especially important in cells that lack the Min system or in cells in which nucleoid replication or segregation are defective. Here, we review the latest findings on these two systems. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.","adenosine triphosphatase; bacterial protein; DNA A; DNA B; FtsA protein; FtsZ protein; MreB protein; protein Min; tubulin; unclassified drug; ZipA protein; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial cell; bacterial genetics; bacterial growth; bacterium mutant; Caulobacter crescentus; cell division; cell polarity; cellular distribution; cytoskeleton; enzyme activity; Escherichia coli; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein localization; protein structure; review; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; sequence homology; species difference; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Division; Chloroplasts; Cytoskeletal Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Spores, Bacterial; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Caulobacter vibrioides; Escherichia coli; Negibacteria; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Posibacteria; Schizosaccharomyces pombe"

However, generation of sufficient signal i.e. 19F cell loading is a key challenge, particularly with non-phagocytic cells such as lymphocytes and stem cells. A range of 19F cell labels have been developed, including emulsions, particles, polymers, and agents for clinical use. Various animal and primary human cells, such as dendritic cells, lymphocytes and phagocytes have been successfully labeled and studied in models of autoimmune disease, inflammation and transplant rejection. Primary human cells, particularly dendritic cells as used in vaccine therapy have been tested for imminent clinical application.

Its activation elicits proteolytic cascades which eventually results in the cleavage of the C5 protein into two fragments, C5a and C5b. The small anaphylatoxin C5a induces a variety of biological responses upon binding to the 7TM receptors C5aR and the C5L2, while the large C5b fragment nucleates formation of the membrane attack complex capable of killing susceptible pathogens by the formation of a pore structure in association with complement components C6, C7, C8, and C9. A number of regulatory molecules help to control C5 mediated immune responses towards host cells, but in several major inflammatory conditions including sepsis and arthritis, C5a is believed to contribute significantly to disease etiology. Inhibition of membrane attack complex assembly is already approved for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. A number of recent crystal structures have provided a comprehensive insight into the architecture and properties of intact C5 and its fragments, and how pathogens interfere with their function. Here we review the functional and structural aspects of C5 and its fragments, the pathological conditions associated with them, and strategies employed by pathogens to interfere with the biological function of C5.

A product that can be used in the pre-hospital setting that adequately carries and delivers oxygen to peripheral tissues would potentially be life saving for severely injured patients. Allogeneic blood is not the ideal agent in the pre-hospital setting. Present limitations in the allogeneic blood supply include the need for cross-matching, refrigeration, marginal supply, transfusion reactions, infectious disease transmission and immunomodulation increasing the risk of organ dysfunction after transfusion. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been under present development for the last 25 years. These compounds use either human or bovine hemoglobin that is then chemically altered to improve safety. These compounds exhibit many desirable characteristics that make them potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of the injured patient. These compounds do not need to be cross-matched, have favorable oxygen dissociation characteristics, long half lives, do not transmit disease, appear to be less immunoreactive than blood and theoretically can be used in the pre-hospital setting as a low volume oxygen carrying solution without need for refrigeration. There are at least three agents presently under development that use different techniques to alter the basic hemoglobin tetramer. While there is no FDA approved hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier approved for use in injured patients at this writing, phase III studies are currently either underway or being developed.

The plight of African vultures exemplifies these challenges due to environmental contaminants and other stressors acting on individuals and populations that are already threatened or endangered. Many of these threats emanate from increasing human population size and settlement density, habitat loss from changing land use for agriculture, residential areas, and industry, and climate-related changes in resource availability. Environmental chemicals that are hazardous include legacy chemicals, emerging chemicals of concern, and high-volume-use chemicals that are employed as weed killers and in other agricultural applications. Furthermore, there are differences in risk for species living in close proximity to humans or in areas affected by habitat loss, climate, and industry. Monitoring programs are essential to track the status of nesting pairs, offspring survival, longevity, and lifetime productivity. This is important for long-lived birds, such as vultures, that may be especially vulnerable to chronic exposure to chemicals as obligate scavengers. Furthermore, their position in the food web may increase risk due to biomagnification of chemicals. We review the primary chemical hazards to Old World vultures and the interacting stressors affecting these and other birds. Habitat is a major consideration for vultures, with tree-nesters and cliff-nesters potentially experiencing different risks of exposure to environmental chemicals. The present review provides information from long-term monitoring programs and discusses a range of these threats and their effects on vulture populations.

Persistent organic pollutants of that kind therefore have stimulated substantial improvement in analytical methods. The aim of this review is to present recent achievements in PFASs determination in various matrices with different methods and its comparison to measurements of Total Organic Fluorine (TOF). Analytical methods used for PFASs determinations are dominated by chromatography, mostly in combination with mass spectrometric detection. However, HPLC may be also hyphenated with conductivity or fluorimetric detection, and gas chromatography may be combined with flame ionization or electron capture detection. The presence of a large number of PFASs species in environmental and biological samples necessitates parallel attempts to develop a total PFASs index that reflects the total content of PFASs in various matrices. Increasing attention is currently paid to the determination of branched isomers of PFASs, and their determination in food. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2013 The Author(s).",NA

The disadvantages of the former include the danger of overcorrection, tissue irritation and possible systemic absorption of the material. As an alternative, solid material such as cartilage or synthetics may be used for augmentation. Experience obtained so far has shown that chips of porous polyethylene (PHDPE) are particularly suitable: they are easy to use, show good tissue tolerance and are anchored by ingrowth of connective tissue.

This review focuses on severe issues on the toxicity, persistency and bioaccumulation of these halogenated products, especially perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the half-lives of which are several years in human serum. After an introduction on their productions, uses and hazards, this minireview updates non-exhaustive recent strategies of synthesis of original fluorosurfactants that may be potentially non-bioaccumulable. These routes have been devoted on: (i) the preparation of CF 3-X-(CH 2) n-SO 3Na (with X=O, C 6H 4O or N(CF 3) and n=8-12), (ii) the use of fluorinated polyethers (achieved either by oligomerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) or by ring opening cationic oligomerization of fluorinated oxetanes; (iii) the telomerization of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) with 1-iodoperfluoralkanes to produce C nF 2n+1-(VDF) 2-CH 2CO 2R (n=2 or 4, R=H or NH 4), (iv) the radical telomerization of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene (TFP) with isoperfluoropropyliodide to prepare (CF 3) 2CF(TFP) x-R H, and (v) the radical cotelomerization of VDF and TFP, or their controlled radical copolymerization in the presence of either (CF 3) 2CFI or a fluorinated xanthate. In most cases, the surface tensions versus the surfactant concentrations have been assessed. These above pathways led to various highly fluorinated (but yet not perfluorinated) telomers or cooligomers, the chemical changes of which enabled to obtain original surfactants as novel alternatives to PFOA, ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO), or PFOS regarded as the PCBs of the XXIst century. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Ammonium perfluorooctanoate; Chemical change; Co-oligomers; Cotelomerization; Fluorinated surfactant; Fluorosurfactants; Fluorotelomers; Half lives; Hexafluoropropylene oxide; Human serum; Oxetanes; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Radical copolymerization; Radical telomerization; Ring opening; Surfactant concentrations; Telomerization; Telomers; Vinylidene fluoride; Ammonium compounds; Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Ethers; Oligomerization; Oligomers; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polyethers; Polymerization; Surface tension; Surface active agents; ammonia; amphophile; cation; copolymer; hexafluoropropylene oxide; monomer; oligomer; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polymer; polystyrene; polyvinyl alcohol; propylene oxide; silicone; surfactant; unclassified drug; vinylidene fluoride; bioaccumulation; biodegradability; catalyst; chemical analysis; chemical modification; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); fluorination; gel permeation chromatography; half life time; health hazard; hydrolysis; molecular weight; oligomerization; polymerization; pressure; review; ring opening; structure analysis; surface tension; synthesis
NA,Perfluorinated chemicals as emerging environmental threats to kidney health: A scoping review,2018,NA,NA,"Background and objectives Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of manufactured nonbiodegradable compounds. Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood, and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and kidney health. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health, World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic, molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys. Results We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13 pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5) demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease, including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2– related factor 2 pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling. Conclusions A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are emerging environmental threats to kidney health; yet several important gaps in our understanding still exist. © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.",NA
NA,Persistent organic pollutants and couple fecundability: a systematic review,2021,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing regulation, exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) remains a serious public health concern due to their accumulation in the environment and ability to biomagnify up the food chain. POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed. © The Author(s) 2020.

Wastewater mainly contains nutrient loads and the recent emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical wastes, drugs, micropollutants, heavy metals, pesticides, phenolic compounds, and dyes have increased and contaminated the aquatic bodies. The existence of these emerging pollutants can cause serious threats to ecosystems and humans. Thus, conventional wastewater treatment was focused on the removal of solid compounds or nutrient loads. However, it could not remove the emerging contaminants and later microalgae that are photosynthetic eukaryotic microorganisms were found to be an efficient and eco-friendly source for the remediation of diverse kinds of wastewater.

A few PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are now known to be ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment. They have become a global concern because of the toxicity and bioaccumulative properties. With the increasing availability of high-resolution mass spectrometers, many novel PFASs have been identified. Studies published between 2009 and 2017 have discovered 455 new PFASs (including nine fully and 446 partially fluorinated compounds), 45%, 29%, 17%, and 8% of which are anions, zwitterions, cations, and neutrals, respectively. They have been identified in natural waters, fish, sediments, wastewater, activated sludge, soils, aqueous film-forming foams, and commercial fluoropolymer surfactants. This article integrates and critically evaluates what is known about these newly identified PFASs. It discusses the different aspects of detection methodologies. It also surveys the removal of these compounds during conventional and advanced drinking-water and wastewater treatment, predicts the relevant physicochemical properties by means of four software programs, and identifies major knowledge gaps. Notably, a number of these newly identified PFASs are potential precursor compounds of PFOS and PFOA.

However, little data exists on the effects of exposure to PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations and this hampers the effective management of these compounds. This paper reviews current research on the occurrence and ecotoxicology of PFAS at environmentally relevant doses to assess their potential biological impacts. Hazard Quotient (HQ) analysis was undertaken as part of this assessment. Most PFAS detected in the environment were found to have a HQ risk value of <1 meaning their reported concentrations are below their predicted no effect concentration. This indicates many reported toxic effects of PFAS are, theoretically, unlikely to occur outside the laboratory. However, lack of information on new PFAS as well as their precursors and degradation products, coupled with lack of knowledge of their mixture toxicity means our understanding of the risks of PFAS is incomplete, especially in regard to sub-lethal and/or chronic effects. It is proposed that the development of molecular markers for PFAS exposure are needed to aid in the development of environmental PFAS regulations that are effective in fully protecting the environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Degradation; Toxicity; Biological impacts; Degradation products; Effective management; Hazard quotients; Mixture toxicity; Molecular marker; Predicted no-effect concentrations; Synthetic chemicals; Environmental regulations; biomarker; concentration (composition); ecological impact; ecotoxicology; environmental monitoring; environmental response; environmental risk; molecular analysis; pollution exposure; regulatory approach; ecotoxicology; metabolomics; review; environmental exposure; human; procedures; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans

They are becoming emerging pollutants for soil and water through effluents from domestic and industrial wastewater. The world health organization (WHO) has identified the spread of antibiotics resistance as one of the major threat and risk for global public health in the future. Therefore, attentions are paid to remove antibiotics from water and wastewater. Various methodologies have been applied for treatment of antibiotics from water and wastewater, those including biological, physical and chemical methods. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with fast reaction rates and strong oxidizing abilities received more attentions among all methods applied for treatment of antibiotics. This review presents various AOPs for oxidation and treatment of antibiotics from wastewater, such as Fenton and Fenton-like oxidation, ozonation and catalytic ozonation, photocatalytic oxidation, electrochemical oxidation and wet oxidation processes, including their brief introduction, principles, main characteristics, factors affecting treatment and their applications. Furthermore, their current applications for the treatment of antibiotics in wastewater are analyzed and summarized. The drawback and advantages of AOPs and the strategies for addressing them, their future perspectives and challenges are argued and concluding remarks are given. © 2021 The Author(s)",NA

A loud systolic murmur of Levine IV/VI was audible on the left sternal border of the 4th intercostal space. The chest X-ray film demonstrated severe pulmonary congestion. The ECG showed abnormal Q waves in II, III, a VF and V1-5. The right heart catheterization revealed an intraventricular shunt from left to right and thus ventricular septal perforation (VSP) 13 days after acute anteroseptal-inferior myocardial infarction was diagnosed. Continuing an aggressive medical treatment with the intraaortic balloon pumping, an emergency operation for VSP was performed 2 days after the onset. A single Teflon patch was sutured on the left side of the septum around VSP (2.5 x 2.5 cm) and the ventricular free wall was closed including the patch with two felt strips. The patient survived through the operation and is doing well at the 11 months of follow-up. Twenty patients above 70 years old have been surgically treated with success for VSP after acute myocardial infarction in Japan.

The close structural similarities lead to physico-chemical properties and environmental fate characteristics which follow a regular pattern and justify the applied read-across within a category approach. Common physical and/or biological properties result in structurally similar breakdown products and are, together with the surfactant properties, responsible for similar environmental behavior. The structural similarities result in the same mode of ecotoxic action. Within each of the three sub-categories of ANS the most important parameter influencing ecotoxicity is the varying length of the alkyl chain. Although the counter-ion may also influence the physico-chemical properties, there is no indication that it significantly affects chemical reactivity, environmental fate and behavior or ecotoxicity of these chemicals.Deduced from physico-chemical and surfactancy properties, the main target compartment for the substances of the ANS category is the hydrosphere. They are quantitatively removed in waste water treatment plants, mainly by biodegradation. Quantitative removal in biological treatment plants is reflected by low AS concentrations measured in effluents of waste water treatment plants (mostly below 10μg/L). In addition, bioaccumulation of ANS does not exceed regulatory triggers based upon experimental data.A considerable number of reliable aquatic toxicity data for the whole ANS category are available, including chronic and subchronic data for species of all trophic levels.Based upon the highest quality data in hand, there appears to be no singularly most sensitive trophic level in tests on the toxicity of alkyl sulfates, with a large degree of overlap among algae, invertebrates and fish. Algae proved to be more variable in sensitivity to alkyl sulfate exposure compared to fish and daphnia. The key study for the aquatic hazard assessment is a chronic test on Ceriodaphnia dubia, which covers a range of the alkyl chain length from C12 to C18. A parabolic response was observed, with the C14 chain length being the most toxic (7d-NOEC=0.045mg/L). Responses of aquatic communities to C12 AS and C14-15 AS have been studied in high quality stream mesocosm studies containing a broad range of species and ecological interactions. These studies are regarded as a better approximation to reality when extrapolating to the environment. The 56-d chronic NOEC for C12 AS and C14-15 AS were 0.224 and 0.106mg/L, respectively, based on integrated assessments of periphyton (algal, bacterial and protozoan) and invertebrate communities.Taking into account the rapid biodegradation of the ANS compounds as well as the low concentrations measured in different environmental compartments, this category of surfactants is of low concern for the environment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","aliphatic hydrocarbon; alkanesulfonic acid; alkenesulfonic acid; anionic surfactant; sulfate; aliphatic hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; ecotoxicology; environmental fate; environmental hazard; hazard assessment; hydrophobicity; physicochemical property; surfactant; alga; bioaccumulation; biodegradation; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); Daphnia; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; fish; hazard assessment; hydrophobicity; hydrosphere; invertebrate; mesocosm; nonhuman; periphyton; physical chemistry; quantitative analysis; review; waste component removal; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; Animals; Anions; Aquatic Organisms; Biodegradation, Environmental; Daphnia; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Hazardous Substances; Invertebrates; Rivers; Surface-Active Agents; Water Pollutants, Chemical; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ceriodaphnia dubia; Daphnia; Invertebrata; Protozoa"

RECENT FINDINGS: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances appear to reduce breastfeeding duration through impaired mammary gland development, lactogenesis, and suppressed endocrine signaling. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons have differing associations with lactation duration, likely because of the variety of signaling pathways that they affect, pointing to the importance of complex mixtures in epidemiologic studies. Although epidemiologic literature suggests that pesticides and fungicides decrease or have no effect on lactation duration, toxicology literature suggests enhanced mammary gland development through estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic pathways. Toxicological studies suggest that phthalates may affect mammary gland development via estrogenic pathways but no association with lactation duration has been observed. Bisphenol A was associated with decreased duration of breastfeeding, likely through direct and indirect action on estrogenic pathways. SUMMARY: EDCs play a role in mammary gland development, function, and lactogenesis, which can affect breastfeeding duration. Further research should explore direct mechanisms of EDCs on lactation, the significance of toxicant mixtures, and transgenerational effects of EDCs on lactation.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; endocrine disruptor; pesticide; phenol derivative; phthalic acid; phthalic acid derivative; adverse event; animal; breast; breast feeding; drug effect; environmental exposure; female; growth, development and aging; human; lactation; physiology; time factor; udder; Animals; Benzhydryl Compounds; Breast; Breast Feeding; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lactation; Mammary Glands, Animal; Pesticides; Phenols; Phthalic Acids; Time Factors"

Considering the detrimental impact of pollutants on human health and ecosystem, their detection in different media including water is paramount. Notably, electrochemical techniques are more appealing owing to their recognized advantages. This research summarizes and evaluates the most recent advances in the electrochemical sensing of environmental pollutants such as heavy metal ions, pesticides, nitroaromatics, and other distinct emerging contaminants. Besides, the review focuses on the application of electrochemical detection of the selected pollutants through analysis of representative reports in the five years from 2016 to 2020. Therefore, the review is intended to contribute insights and guidelines to contemporary progress in specific electrochemical application practices based on graphene derivatives, toward the aforenamed pollutants. Thus, it focused on sensing methods such as cyclic voltammetry, anodic stripping voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing different sensing elements incorporating graphene. Moreover, the review also highlighted graphene synthesis pathways, sensor design strategies, and functionalization. Furthermore, the review showed that there is congruence in the literature that functionalized graphene and its derivatives remain as viable modifiers in electrochemical sensing of pollutants. Nonetheless, the study also appraised the absence of literature reports on electrochemical detection of natural organic matter substances like humic acid and fulvic acid using a graphene-based sensor. In reckoning, current challenges related to graphene synthesis and applicability, envisaged opportunities, and future perspectives are outlined. © Copyright © 2021 Kumunda, Adekunle, Mamba, Hlongwa and Nkambule.",Agricultural robots; Aromatic compounds; Chemical detection; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemical sensors; Graphene; Heavy metals; Metal ions; Organic acids; Pesticides; Water pollution; Water quality; Anodic stripping voltammetry; Electrochemical applications; ELectrochemical detection; Electrochemical techniques; Environmental challenges; Environmental pollutants; Functionalized graphene; Natural organic matters; Pollution detection

Its long half-life in humans, indefinite persistence in the environment, and awareness of its widespread presence in drinking water make the human health assessment of PFOS a priority. While developmental, endocrine, and hepatic effects, and increased serum cholesterol are among the outcomes resulting from PFOS exposure, immunosuppression has also consistently emerged as an adverse effect. An in-depth review of the relevant scientific literature on the toxicology of PFOS has identified immunosuppression as a sensitive endpoint for PFOS toxicity. Here, we focus specifically on that endpoint and provide a detailed derivation of a Reference Dose (RfD) of 1.8 × 10−6 mg/kg/day for chronic human exposure to PFOS. This RfD is based on decreased plaque-forming cell (PFC) response in mice, an endpoint that reflects suppression of the immune response to a foreign antigen. We additionally identify two endpoints in the epidemiology literature, decreased vaccine response and increased incidence of childhood infections, that are associated with PFOS exposure and that are consistent with and support the decreased PFC response endpoint from animal studies. We provide a weight of evidence analysis integrating the evidence from animal and epidemiology endpoints. Finally, we compare this RfD to the PFOS RfD derived by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Office of Water based on a developmental endpoint. Based on this comparison, and given our assessment, the USEPA RfD does not provide sufficient protection against the adverse health effects of PFOS. The RfD derived herein is intended to be public health protective and appropriately minimizes PFOS exposure based on available evidence. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",drinking water; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; cell; chemical compound; developmental biology; dose-response relationship; ecotoxicology; epidemiology; health monitoring; immune response; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; analytical parameters; cholesterol blood level; dose; immune response; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotoxicity; infection; nonhuman; plaque forming cell; priority journal; reference dose; Review; animal; child; environmental exposure; human; mouse; United States; Animalia; Mus; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Child; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Mice

Dairy products and specific oils like coconut oil are natural sources of dietary C8:0 but higher intakes of this fatty acid can be provided with MCT (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) oil that consists in 75% of C8:0. MCFAs have physical and metabolic properties that are distinct from those of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCFAs ≥12 carbons). Beneficial physiological effects of dietary C8:0 have been studied for a long time and MCT oil has been used as a special energy source for patients suffering from pancreatic insufficiency, impaired lymphatic chylomicron transport and fat malabsorption. More recently, caprylic acid was also shown to acylate ghrelin, the only known peptide hormone with an orexigenic effect. Through its covalent binding to the ghrelin peptide, caprylic acid exhibits an emerging and specific role in modulating physiological functions themselves regulated by octanoylated ghrelin. Dietary caprylic acid is therefore now suspected to provide the ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) enzyme with octanoyl-CoA co-substrates necessary for the acyl modification of ghrelin. This review tries to highlight the discrepancy between the formerly described beneficial effects of dietary MCFAs on body weight loss and the C8:0 newly reported effect on appetite stimulation via ghrelin octanoylation. The subsequent aim of this review is to demonstrate the relevance of carrying out further studies to better understand the physiological functions of this particular fatty acid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).","ghrelin; medium chain fatty acid; octanoic acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; acyltransferase; chylomicron; fat intake; ghrelin; ghrelin O-acyltransferase, human; octanoic acid; octanoic acid derivative; acylation; antibacterial activity; antiviral activity; appetite; bioavailability; biosynthesis; chemical reaction; fat intake; fatty acid metabolism; hormone synthesis; lipid storage; nonhuman; octanoylation; Review; weight reduction; animal; fat intake; human; lipoylation; metabolism; pancreas exocrine insufficiency; pharmacology; Acylation; Acyltransferases; Animals; Caprylates; Chylomicrons; Dietary Fats; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency; Ghrelin; Humans; Lipoylation"

The design of this study is a literature review. The scientific literature concerning BC were reviewed, especially focusing on the Arctic and the special conditions that exist in this region. Breast cancer incidence is increasing all over the world, including in the Arctic. The enormous transition in health conditions and lifestyle in the Arctic might be contributing to the known risk factors. In Greenland, the age at menarche has diminished by 3 years during the course of 100 years, and the number of children per women as well as the duration of breastfeeding is decreasing. Obesity and intake of saturated fat is increasing and the intake of traditional food rich in unsaturated fat and vitamin D decreasing. Smoking and alcohol consumption in the Arctic has been relatively high but is now decreasing. More focus on genetic susceptibility in relation to BC has identified the specific BRCA1 founder mutation in the Greenlandic population, which might appear to be an important risk factor. However, the known established risk factors alone cannot account for the increasing trend observed. Studies suggest that environmental contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including perfluorinated compounds increase the risk of BC possibly in conjunction with certain genetic polymorphisms involved in carcinogen activation. The lipophilic POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides are found at very high levels in the Arctic population. Several factors can explain the increasing incidence of BC in the Arctic. The transition in lifestyle and health conditions unfortunately increases the known risk factors of BC. Moreover, the population of the Arctic might show up to be especially vulnerable because of the contemporary high burden of POPs and genetic susceptibility. © 2012 Stine Overvad Fredslund and Eva Cecilie Bonefeld-Jørgensen.",Arctic; breast tumor; female; human; incidence; review; risk factor; Arctic Regions; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Risk Factors

The deficiency of acid α-glucosidase in GSD II is associated with intracellular vacuoles filled with glycogen. However, the deficiency of α-glucosidase does not account for the following unexpected findings in GSD II: excessive accumulation of extralysosomal glycogen; normal appearance of the patient at birth, despite as severely affected tissues as found at death from muscle failure several months later; similar α-glucosidase deficiency in the devastated muscle of an adult with GSD II as in the same patient's heart that was normal in weight, size, and glycogen concentration, and essentially normal histologically; initial excessive glycogen accumulation in areas of adult GSD II myocytes that do not exhibit glycogen-filled 'abnormal lysosomes;' the presence in hepatocytes of occasional tightly-packed glycogen accumulations not surrounded by a membrane; and a drop in glycogen concentration and disappearance of abnormal lysosomes from the liver of a patient with GSD II who had received a long-term infusion of glycogen-degrading enzymes. The lysosomes were not apparent during continued enzyme infusion, whereas liver glycogen concentration returned to high values. We speculate that these unexpected findings can result from the synthesis of a type of glycogen that requires functioning lysosomes for its disposal. The rate of synthesis of this glycogen may be different in normal cells and in cells affected with GSD II. Treatment with enzymes will probably be unsuccessful as long as they cannot be introduced into clinically affected organs. Gold particles in vitro entered selected compartments of abnormal lysosomes; perfluorinated particles in vivo entered RE cells including Kupfer cells, but neither type of particle entered cells of muscle, heart, or brain, which was also true for exogenous enzymes. Thus, at present, prenatal diagnosis is of practical importance in lysosomal disease. The diagnosis can be quickly accomplished by electron microscopy of uncultured amniotic fluid cells in GSD II, but not in Hurler's disease, which instead, requires the assay of α-L-iduronidase in cultured cells. An affected fetus with either disease gives electron microscopic and enzymatic findings that are characteristic for the respective disorder. A girl with deficiencies of arylsulfatases A, B, and C and intact iduronidase had brain and liver characteristics by electron microscopy that were different from metachromatic leucodystrophy (which is characterized by arylsulfatase A deficiency), but was identical to that observed in Hurler's or Hunter's diseases (which are characterized by the deficiency of iduronidase or iduronosulfate sulfatase, respectively). To explain this observation, we postulate that the tissue of the girl with multiple sulfatase deficiency is also deficient in iduronosulfate sulfatase, i.e., in the enzyme that is defective in Hunter's disease. Transplantation of normal fibroblasts has been reported by others to have had beneficial effects in three patients with Hunter's disease; we applied the technique to one boy with Hurler's disease and saw no ill effects. Benefits, if any, have not yet been assessed. In Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is presumed to be a lysosomal disease because of cellular inclusions and the nature of leucocyte dysfunction, a specific enzyme defect has apparently not been described. Nonetheless, the administration of vitamin C has been reported by others to associated in vitro with the normalization of cyclic 3',5'-AMP concentration, and in vivo with the survival of patients with this previously fatal disease.","adrenalin; enzyme; brain cortex; diagnosis; electron microscopy; glycogen storage disease; histology; hurler syndrome; inborn error of metabolism; liver; lysosome; review; skin; therapy; Chediak-Higashi Syndrome; Female; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Human; Infant, Newborn; Leukodystrophy, Metachromatic; Lysosomes; Mucopolysaccharidosis II; Pregnancy; Sulfatases; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

The availability of mice with specific deficiencies of components of the complement system has provided new insights into the mechanisms by which complement might be involved in autoimmunity and tissue injury in SLE. In humans, deficiencies of early components of the classical complement pathway are strongly associated with SLE. Mice lacking C1q or C4 are also predisposed to autoimmunity, which is associated with the failure of normal clearance of apoptotic cells bearing on their surfaces many of the autoantigens involved in SLE. Antiphospholipid syndrome is common in patients with SLE and studies in an animal model of fetal loss caused by antiphospholipid syndrome have shown that injury is dependent on activation of complement with subsequent neutrophil influx and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor. Insights from animal models might enable the design of more rational therapeutic approaches for manipulating the complement system in human SLE. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.","CD19 antigen; CD81 antigen; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; complement component C1q; complement component C1r; complement component C1s; complement component C2; complement component C3a; complement component C3b; complement component C4; complement component C5 inhibitor; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement inhibitor; Fc receptor; heparin; hirudin; properdin; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor; antigen recognition; antiphospholipid syndrome; apoptosis; autoimmunity; cardiovascular disease; complement activation; complement alternative pathway; complement classical pathway; complement inhibition; complement lectin pathway; complement system; cytokine production; dendritic cell; disease predisposition; drug efficacy; fetus wastage; human; hypocomplementemia; immunological tolerance; immunopathogenesis; lupus erythematosus nephritis; nonhuman; priority journal; review; systemic lupus erythematosus; Animals; Apoptosis; Autoimmunity; Complement Activation; Complement System Proteins; Disease Progression; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic"

They have the potential to marginally delay the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, there have been inconsistencies in reports of the MCT dose–response relationship, which may be due to differences in MCT composition, participant characteristics, and other factors that can influence ketone generation. To resolve these discrepancies, we reviewed studies that investigated the ketogenic effect of MCTs in healthy adults. Aside from the treatment dose, other factors that can influence the ketogenic response, such as accompanying meals, fasting duration, and caffeine intake, were assessed. Based on the available literature, four practical recommendations are made to optimize the ketogenic effect of MCTs and reduce unwanted side effects (primarily gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea). First, the starting dose should be either 5 g of octanoic acid [caprylic acid (C8); a component of MCTs] or 5 g of a combination of C8 and decanoic or capric acid (C10; another component of MCTs), and the dose should be progressively increased to 15–20 g of C8. Second, MCTs should be consumed after an overnight fast, without an accompanying meal if tolerable, or with a low-carbohydrate meal. Third, the addition of caffeine may slightly increase the ketogenic response. Fourth, emulsifying the MCTs might increase their ketogenic effect and alleviate side effects.

FtsZ polymerizes into a dynamic ring that defines the division site, recruits downstream proteins, and directs peptidoglycan synthesis to drive constriction. Recent studies have documented treadmilling of FtsZ polymer clusters both in cells and in vitro. Emerging evidence suggests that FtsZ dynamics are regulated largely by intrinsic properties of FtsZ itself and by the membrane anchoring protein FtsA. Although FtsZ dynamics are broadly required for Z-ring assembly, their role(s) during constriction may vary among bacterial species. These recent advances set the stage for future studies to investigate how FtsZ dynamics are physically and/or functionally coupled to peptidoglycan metabolic enzymes to direct efficient division. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","bacterial protein; FtsZ protein; guanosine triphosphatase; polymer; bacterial protein; cytoskeleton protein; FtsZ protein, Bacteria; peptidoglycan; bacterial cell wall; bacterium; cell division; cell membrane; cytoarchitecture; enzyme activity; nonhuman; polymerization; priority journal; protein binding; protein function; Review; transmission electron microscopy; bacterium; cell wall; classification; cytology; metabolism; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Division; Cell Wall; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Peptidoglycan"

It has been manufactured from past 40 years but its presence in the environment was initially reported in 2006. Later, it has been found in various biotic and abiotic environmental matrices. However, little attention has been paid to monitor its presence in Asia. Many studies have reported the occurrence of DP in the environment of Asia, yet the data are scarce, and studies are limited to few regions. The objective of present review is to summarize the occurrence, distribution, and toxicity of this ubiquitous pollutant in various environmental matrices (biotic and abiotic). DP has also been reported in the areas with no emission sources, which proves its long-range transport. Moreover, urbanization and industrialization also affect the distribution of DP, i.e., high levels of DP have been found in urban areas relative to the rural. Tidal movement also incorporates in transport of DP across the aquatic system. Further, bioaccumulation trend of DP in various tissues is kidney > liver > muscle tissues, whereas, blood brain barrier resists its accumulation in brain tissues. Additionally, gender-based accumulation trends revealed high DP levels in females in comparison to males due to strong metabolism of males. Furthermore, methodological aspects and instrumental analysis used in previous studies have also been summarized here. However, data on biomagnification in aquatic ecosystem and bioaccumulation of DP in terrestrial food web are still scarce. Toxicity behavior of syn-DP and anti-DP is still unknown which might gain the interest for future studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","bioaccumulation; blood; brain; environmental quality; flame retardant; food web; industrialization; long range transport; metabolism; toxicity; Asia; chlorinated hydrocarbon; dechlorane plus; flame retardant; polycyclic hydrocarbon; Asia; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; female; pollutant; Asia; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Flame Retardants; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Polycyclic Compounds"

To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials. © Geesien S.A.

Stick-slip motion was not observed even for the smooth surface for the modified PFPE tape. The friction is almost independent of the PFPE structure, but depends on the amine structures. The ammonium salt being tightly anchored to the rubbing surface covers uniformly, which leads to better lubricity. The higher dispersive interaction of the hydrophobic group of the amine is endowed with a compensating friction reduction. Steric hindrance of the hydrophilic group causes a high friction. Based on these findings, a saturated long chain ammonium salt is the best selection. Moreover, the modified PFPEs are dissolved in alcohol and hexane, which makes practical use convenient without any environmental problems. These ionic lubricants invented around 1987 have been used for magnetic tapes for about a quarter century because of their good lubricity and are reviewed in this paper. © 2012 Hirofumi Kondo.",NA

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are isotactic polymers that play a critical role in the central metabolism of producer bacteria, as they act as dynamic reservoirs of carbon and reducing equivalents. PHAs continue to attract industrial attention as a starting point toward renewable, biodegradable, biocompatible, and versatile thermoplastic and elastomeric materials. Pseudomonas species have been known for long as efficient biopolymer producers, especially for medium-chain-length PHAs. The surge of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering approaches in recent years offers the possibility of exploiting the untapped potential of Pseudomonas cell factories for the production of tailored PHAs. In this article, an overview of the metabolic and regulatory circuits that rule PHA accumulation in Pseudomonas putida is provided, and approaches leading to the biosynthesis of novel polymers (e.g., PHAs including nonbiological chemical elements in their structures) are discussed. The potential of novel PHAs to disrupt existing and future market segments is closer to realization than ever before.

These effects include increased β-oxidation of fatty acids, increases in several cytochrome P-450 (CYP450)-mediated reactions, and inhibition of the secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and cholesterol from the liver. These effects on lipid metabolism and transport result in a reduction of cholesterol and triglycerides in serum and an accumulation of lipids in the liver. The triad of tumors observed (liver, Leydig cell, and pancreatic acinar-cell) is typical of many PPAR agonists and is believed to involve nongenotoxic mechanisms. The hepatocellular tumors observed in rats are likely to have been the result of the activation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα). The tumors observed in the testis (Leydig-cell) have been hypothesized to be associated with an increased level of serum estradiol in concert with testicular growth factors. The mechanism responsible for the acinarcell tumors of the pancreas in rats remains the subject of active investigation. The mechanism resulting in the hepatocellular tumors in rats (PPARα activation) is not likely to be relevant to humans. Similarly, the proposed mechanism for Leydig-cell tumor formation is of questionable relevance to humans. Acinar tumors of the pancreas are rare in humans, and the relevance of the these tumors, as found in rats, to humans is uncertain.

WTP and WRRF flows release PFAS in liquid-phase, solid-phase, and gas-phase matrices. The purpose of this review is to educate and inform readers of the fate and transport of PFASs throughout the urban water cycle emphasizing the WTP-WRRF connection. Source reduction programs, treatments that interrupt the PFAS cycle, and comprehensive analytical methods are future research needs. © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.",Aquifers; Gas plants; Hydrogeology; Potable water; Urban transportation; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Forever chemical; Gas-phases; Liquid Phase; Liquid phasis; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Phase matrix; Polyfluoroalkyl substance cycling; Polyfluoroalkyl substance environmental source; Polyfluoroalkyl substance in gas-phase matrix; Polyfluoroalkyl substance in liquid-phase matrix; Polyfluoroalkyl substance in solid-phase matrix; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Resource recovery; Solid phasis; Solid-phase; Water cycle; Water resource recovery facility; Waters resources; Gases; chemical substance; drinking water; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water treatment

Nowadays, their potential non-bioaccumulable alternatives have been developed to meet the requirements of environmental sustainable development. In this paper, the recent advances of potential non-bioaccumulable fluorinated surfactants with different fluorocarbon chain structures, including the short perfluorocarbon chain, the branched fluorocarbon chain, and the fluorocarbon chain with weak points, are reviewed from the aspects of synthesis processes, properties, and structure-activity relationships. And their applications in emulsion polymerization of fluorinated olefins, handling membrane proteins, and leather manufacture also are summarized. Furthermore, the challenges embedded in the current non-bioaccumulable fluorinated surfactants are also highlighted and discussed with the hope to provide a valuable reference for the prosperous development of fluorinated surfactants.

Biomolecular emergence scenarios have proliferated in the literature but accounting for the ubiquity of oxidized (+ 5) phosphate (PO43−) in extant biochemistries has been challenging due to the dearth of phosphate and molecular oxygen on the primordial Earth. A compelling body of work suggests that exogenous schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)3P) was delivered to Earth via meteorite impacts during the Heavy Bombardment (ca. 4.1–3.8 Gya) and there converted to reduced P oxyanions (e.g., phosphite (HPO32−) and hypophosphite (H2PO2−)) and phosphonates. Inspired by this idea, we review the relevant literature to deduce a plausible reduced phospholipid analog of modern phosphatidylcholines that could have emerged in a primordial hydrothermal setting. A shallow alkaline lacustrine basin underlain by active hydrothermal fissures and meteoritic schreibersite-, clay-, and metal-enriched sediments is envisioned. The water column is laden with known and putative primordial hydrothermal reagents. Small system dimensions and thermal- and UV-driven evaporation further concentrate chemical precursors. We hypothesize that a reduced phospholipid arises from Fischer–Tropsch-type (FTT) production of a C8 alkanoic acid, which condenses with an organophosphinate (derived from schreibersite corrosion to hypophosphite with subsequent methylation/oxidation), to yield a reduced protophospholipid. This then condenses with an α-amino nitrile (derived from Strecker-type reactions) to form the polar head. Preliminary modeling results indicate that reduced phospholipids do not aggregate rapidly; however, single layer micelles are stable up to aggregates with approximately 100 molecules. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","evaporation; meteorite; modeling; phospholipid; phosphorite; phosphorus; phosphate; phospholipid; phosphorus; astronomy; Earth, Planet; Meteoroids; Phosphates; Phospholipids; Phosphorus"

The skin coverage is usually adequate but the aponeurotic defect has to be closed temporally using synthetic patches. The use of these materials leads to increase complication such as infection, fistula formation and extrusion. In addition a second operation is required to remove the material and to perform a definitive closure. The role of fascia lata in reconstruction of abdominal wall is well established as free grafts, pedicled flaps or free flaps. Bank cadaveric fascia lata is used extensively in neurosurgical, ophtalmological, orthopaedic and urogynecological procedures. This is the first description of the use of cadaveric fascia lata for the closure of large abdominal wall defects. CASE REPORTS: We present two cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The first patient was a newborn who presented the impossibility to close the fascia, that was salvaged by a teflón patch. Five months later the wound opened, leaving the mesh exposed that had to be removed. A cadaveric fascia lata patch was used to cover the defect, closing the skin satisfactorily. The second case was a two days newborn. We performed the diaphragmatic closure, and the aponeurotic defect was closed using cadaveric fascia lata. RESULTS: Cosmetic and functional appearance are satisfactory in both cases and no complications have been seen. CONCLUSION: Fascia lata patches are revascularized in the abdominal wall and incorporates into receptor tissue. They have the following advantages with respect to synthetic materials: First, the risk of complications is lower. Second, their removal is not necessary. Finally, no intraperitoneal adhesions occur. The risks of disease transmission and rejection are minimized by the Centro Comunitario de Transfusiones donor selection and processing of the cadaveric fascia lata.","abdominal wall musculature; cadaver; case report; fascia lata; human; male; newborn; review; transplantation; Abdominal Muscles; Cadaver; Fascia Lata; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male"

In particular, it is shown how the electronic properties may be controlled by synthetic design. Insoluble poly(para-phenylene) can be made by a variety of precursor routes. Attachment of solubilising side chains gives soluble polyphenylenes in which a high degree of torsion between adjacent benzene rings produced by steric interactions between the substituents strongly reduces their electronic interaction. The phenylene units can be made coplanar by bridging them with methine or other bridges to produce ladder-type polymers, which show excellent photophysical properties, but strong intermolecular interactions lead to problems in obtaining blue emission. Similar problems are seen for 'stepladder' polymers such as polyfluorenes with only partial bridging of the phenylene rings. These interactions may be controlled by introduction of bulky substituents. The electroluminescence efficiency of these materials can also be enhanced by use of charge-transporting substituents. Copolymerisation with lower-band-gap units enables tuning of the emission colour across the entire visible range. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",NA

Since 1929 it has been known that filling the lung with liquid, instead of air, reduces these pressures by at least half. However, although most liquids are unable to dissolve sufficient amounts of oxygen, perfluorocarbons (PFCs; bio-chemically stable liquids) are able to dissolve high amounts of oxygen at normobaric pressures. Instillation of PFCs into the lung with superimposed mechanical ventilation allows normal gas exchange both in healthy and diseased lungs. The technique of superimposed ventilation is known as partial liquid ventilation (PLV). Our group was the first to apply this technique in an animal model of ARDS. The knowledge and experience gained from these first experiments have provided an extensive and ongoing interest in PLV in ARDS. In this review we will focus on the use of PFCs in ARDS. We discuss the current knowledge on the effect of PFCs on hemodynamics, progress of lung injury, anti-inflammatory properties and the possible side-effects. Furthermore, data on clinical trials are discussed and guidelines for future application of PFCs in ARDS are presented.",fluorocarbon; oxygen; surfactant; adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway pressure; antiinflammatory activity; capillary; clinical trial; hemodynamics; human; liquid ventilation; lung alveolus; lung injury; practice guideline; review; surface tension

Redox flow batteries are considered to be among the best options for electricity storage in the megawatt range and large demonstration systems have already been installed. Although the full technological potential of these systems has not been reached yet, currently the main problem hindering more widespread commercialization is the high cost of redox flow batteries. Nafion, as the preferred membrane material, is responsible for about 11% of the overall cost of a 1 MW/8MWh system. Therefore, in recent years two main membrane-related research threads have emerged: 1) chemical and physical modification of Nafion membranes to optimize their properties with regard to vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) application; and 2) replacement of the Nafion membranes with different, less expensive materials. This review summarizes the underlying basic scientific issues associated with membrane use in VRFBs and presents an overview of membrane-related research approaches aimed at improving the efficiency of VRFBs and making the technology cost-competitive.

With the completion of the sequencing of the Human Genome and the initiation of the HapMap project the concept that the chromosomes of the mammalian genome are a mosaic, or patchwork, of conserved extended block haplotype sequences is now accepted by the mainstream genomics research community. Ancestral Haplotypes (AHs) can be viewed as a recombined string of smaller Polymorphic Frozen Blocks (PFBs). How have such variant extended DNA sequence tracts emerged in evolution? Here the relevant literature on the problem is reviewed from various fields of molecular and cell biology particularly molecular immunology and comparative and functional genomics. Based on our synthesis we then advance a testable molecular and cellular model. A critical part of the analysis concerns the origin of the strand biased mutation signatures in the transcribed regions of the human and higher primate genome, A-to-G versus T-to-C (ratio ~1.5 fold) and C-to-T versus G-to-A (≥1.5 fold). A comparison and evaluation of the current state of the fields of immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) and Transcription-Coupled DNA Repair focused on how mutations in newly synthesized RNA might be copied back to DNA thus accounting for some of the genome-wide strand biases (e.g., the A-to-G vs T-to-C component of the strand biased spectrum). We hypothesize that the genesis of PFBs and extended AHs occurs during mutagenic episodes in evolution (e.g., retroviral infections) and that many of the critical DNA sequence diversifying events occur first at the RNA level, e.g., recombination between RNA strings resulting in tandem and dispersed RNA duplications (retroduplications), RNA mutations via adenosine-to-inosine pre-mRNA editing events as well as error prone RNA synthesis. These are then copied back into DNA by a cellular reverse transcription process (also likely to be error-prone) that we have called ""reverse transcription-mediated long DNA conversion."" Finally we suggest that all these activities and others can be envisaged as being brought physically under the umbrella of special sites in the nucleus involved in transcription known as ""transcription factories."". © 2011 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",adenosine; inosine; messenger RNA precursor; DNA sequence; functional genomics; gene mutation; genetic polymorphism; genetic recombination; genetic transcription; genetic variability; haplotype; human; human genome; molecular evolution; mosaicism; nonhuman; primate; priority journal; reverse transcription; review; RNA analysis; RNA editing; RNA synthesis; somatic hypermutation

Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially.

Over that time span, 1H imaging flourished and was adopted worldwide with an endless array of applications and imaging approaches, making magnetic resonance an indispensable pillar of biomedical diagnostic imaging. For many years during this timeframe, 19F imaging research continued at a slow pace as the various attributes of the technique were explored. However, over the last decade and particularly the last several years, the pace and clinical relevance of 19F imaging has exploded. In part, this is due to advances in MRI instrumentation, 19F/1H coil designs, and ultrafast pulse sequence development for both preclinical and clinical scanners. These achievements, coupled with interest in the molecular imaging of anatomy and physiology, and combined with a cadre of innovative agents, have brought the concept of 19F into early clinical evaluation. In this review, we attempt to provide a slice of this rich history of research and development, with a particular focus on liquid perfluorocarbon compound-based agents. © 2015 THE AUTHORS.

The review focuses primarily on chemicals of recent concern, including phthalates, bisphenol-A, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and perfluorinated compounds, but also addresses chemicals with longer histories of investigation, including air pollutants, lead, methylmercury, manganese, arsenic, and organophosphate pesticides. For some chemicals of more recent concern, the available literature does not yet afford strong conclusions about neurodevelopment toxicity. In such cases, points of disagreement among studies are identified and suggestions provided for approaches to resolution of the inconsistencies, including greater standardization of methods for expressing exposure and assessing outcomes.

Current ad-hoc clinical protocols require signifcant clinical effort and produce highly variable results. Model-based methods can provide tight, patient specifc control, while addressing practical clinical diffculties and dynamic patient evolution. However, tight control remains elusive as there is not enough understanding of the relationship between control performance and clinical outcome. Methods: The general problem and performance criteria are defned. The clinical studies performed to date using both ad-hoc titration and model-based methods are reviewed. Studies reporting mortality outcome are analysed in terms of standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and a 95th percentile (±2σ) standard error (SE95%) to enable better comparison across cohorts. Results: Model-based control trials lower blood glucose into a 72-110 mg/dL band within 10 hours, have target accuracy over 90%, produce fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and require no additional clinical intervention. Plotting SMR versus SE95% shows potentially high correlation (r=0.84) between ICU mortality and tightness of control. Summary: Model-based methods provide tighter, more adaptable one method fts all solutions, using methods that enable patientspecifc modeling and control. Correlation between tightness of control and clinical outcome suggests that performance metrics, such as time in a relevant glycemic band, may provide better guidelines. Overall, compared to the current one size fts all sliding scale and ad-hoc regimens, patient-specifc pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic model-based, or one method fts all control, utilizing computational and emerging sensor technologies, offers improved treatment and better potential outcomes when treating hyperglycemia in the highly dynamic critically ill patient. © Diabetes Technology Society.",NA

Testosterone and its metabolically activated product dihydrotestosterone are critical for the development of male reproductive system and spermatogenesis. At least four steroidogenic enzymes are involved in testosterone biosynthesis: Cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) for the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone within the mitochondria, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B), for the conversion of pregnenolone into progesterone, 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) for the conversion of progesterone into androstenedione and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B3) for the formation of testosterone from androstenedione. Testosterone is also metabolically activated into more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone by two isoforms 5a-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and 2 (SRD5A2) in Leydig cells and peripheral tissues. Many endocrine disruptors act as antiandrogens via directly inhibiting one or more enzymes for testosterone biosynthesis and metabolic activation. These chemicals include industrial materials (perfluoroalkyl compounds, phthalates, bisphenol A and benzophenone) and pesticides/biocides (methoxychlor, organotins, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and prochloraz) and plant constituents (genistein and gossypol).

Physical isolation of cell bodies and axons is achieved by culturing neurons in tri-chambered Teflon rings. Dissociated ganglia are plated in one end compartment of the trichamber, and axonal growth is guided underneath watertight silicone grease barriers into a separate compartment. Since the axons and cell bodies are located in different compartments, they can be infected and assayed separately. We describe the assembly and use of compartmented neuronal cultures for in vitro study of directional infection of neurons by alpha herpesviruses. Selective application of viral inoculum to only one compartment ensures that the remainder of the neuron is not contaminated by input inoculum.

A common feature of both infant and acute respiratory distress syndromes is an inability of the lung's surfactant system to adequately lower surface tension, leading to regions of atelectasis. Liquid ventilation with PFC appears to ameliorate the disease process by lowering interfacial tension in the lung, opening regions of atelectasis, and improving gas exchange. To understand how gas exchange is successful during liquid ventilation requires careful re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying our current models of gas exchange physiology during normal gas ventilation. These assumptions must then be examined in light of the alterations in pulmonary physiology during liquid ventilation.",perfluoro compound; animal experiment; atelectasis; guinea pig; lung alveolus surface tension; lung compliance; lung gas exchange; lung ventilation distribution; lung ventilation perfusion ratio; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; respiratory distress syndrome; review; total lung capacity; treatment outcome

For instance, the committee rightly defines the ""induction"" as nothing more or less than the first suggestion after the introduction. However, the definition stumbles over its nonposition on whether the word hypnosis must be uttered during the procedure. This equivocation invites research designs that preemptively define a hypnotic group and a control group in terms of whether or not the word hypnosis is used in the protocol. These designs represent a backslide into naive operationism; they reveal little new about human nature or hypnosis. The field deserves an optimally heuristic definition that preserves pluralism and is relatively resistant to the teflon shield of preemptive definition.

The objectives of the workshop were to: 1. Review findings related to the role of environmental chemicals, referred to as ""metabolic disruptors"", in obesity and metabolic syndrome with special attention to recent discoveries from animal model and epidemiology studies; 2. Identify conclusions that could be drawn with confidence from existing animal and human data; 3. Develop predictions based on current data; and 4. Identify critical knowledge gaps and areas of uncertainty. The consensus statements are intended to aid in expanding understanding of the role of metabolic disruptors in the obesity and metabolic disease epidemics, to move the field forward by assessing the current state of the science and to identify research needs on the role of environmental chemical exposures in these diseases.

Intensive usage of industrial compounds has led to the massive emission to the environment and therefore their potential adverse effects may endanger aquatic organisms and human health. Based on the available literatures, organotins and flame retardants are two main groups of EPs from industrial emission identified in Indonesian seafood, as well as in those worldwide. However, concentration of both EPs group detected in Indonesian seafood is relatively low than that in developed countries and the majority of South East Asian countries. Toxicological studies revealed that EPs emitted from industrial activities have to be concern, as most of the EPs attributed to endocrine disrupting chemicals. Nevertheless, study on the exposure assessment of EPs in Indonesia is very limited. Even though, the concentrations of EPs in Indonesian seafood produce exposure below tolerable daily intake (TDI) to the local consumer, the long term exposures have to be aware due to their possible continues emission and elevating concentration such as shown by flame retardants. Governmental regulation, monitoring programs, and laboratory approach are among issues to be concern in addressing EPs in Indonesia, especially from industrial emission. © 2019, Squalen BMFPB.",NA

Such non-IgE-mediated ""pseudoallergic"" reactions are primarily caused by (1) certain liposomal formulations of intravenous drugs and imaging agents, (2) infusion liquids containing micelle-forming amphiphilic lipids or synthetic block-copolymer emulsifiers, and (3) iodinated radiocontrast media with limited solubility in water. Common features of the latter ""pseudoallergens"" include the capacity to activate the complement (C) system; also, the symptoms they cause are often typical manifestations of excessive anaphylatoxin generation in blood. Hence, these reactions have been called ""C activation-related pseudoallergy"" (CARPA). The present review surveys the experimental and clinical evidence for the involvement of C activation in HSRs caused by pseudoallergens in the above three categories. To fit CARPA within the classical scheme of HSRs, a subdivision of Type I allergy is proposed on the basis of the mechanism of mast cell (and basophil) activation. The new scheme distinguishes direct and receptor- mediated HSRs, with the latter category subdivided to true IgE-mediated allergy; anaphylatoxin- mediated CARPA; and IgE plus anaphylatoxin double-triggered reactions. Further issues addressed in the review include animal models, risk factors, laboratory predictive tests, and pharmacological prevention of CARPA.",acetrizoic acid; amphotericin B cholesterol sulfate; amphotericin B lipid complex; chelating agent; complement; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C3b receptor derivative; contrast medium; cremophor; doxorubicin; drug carrier; fluosol da; hydrazinonicotinamide phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate plus polyethylene glycol; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin E; iodamide; iodixanol; iohexol; liposome; macrogol; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody c5a; monoclonal antibody c5g1.1; nicotinamide; paclitaxel; perfluorotributylamine; poloxamer; polyoxyethylene; ricinomacrogol; solvent; tp 10; tp 20; unclassified drug; basophil; cell activation; clinical trial; complement activation; complement activation related pseudoallergy; disease model; drug delivery system; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; human; immediate type hypersensitivity; laboratory test; mast cell; micelle; nonhuman; prediction; reaction analysis; review; risk factor; symptom

However, data clearly characterizing the impact of environmental exposures and health endpoints in African populations is limited. To describe recent progress and identify important research gaps, we reviewed literature on environmental health research in African populations over the last decade, as well as research incorporating both genomic and environmental factors. We queried PubMed for peer-reviewed research articles, reviews, or books examining environmental exposures and health outcomes in human populations in Africa. Searches utilized medical subheading (MeSH) terms for environmental exposure categories listed in the March 2018 US National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, which includes chemicals with worldwide distributions. Our search strategy retrieved 540 relevant publications, with studies evaluating health impacts of ambient air pollution (n=105), indoor air pollution (n = 166), heavy metals (n = 130), pesticides (n = 95), dietary mold (n = 61), indoor mold (n = 9), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs, n = 0), electronic waste (n = 9), environmental phenols (n = 4), flame retardants (n = 8), and phthalates (n = 3), where publications could belong to more than one exposure category. Only 23 publications characterized both environmental and genomic risk factors. Cardiovascular and respiratory health endpoints impacted by air pollution were comparable to observations in other countries. Air pollution exposures unique to Africa and some other resource limited settings were dust and specific occupational exposures. Literature describing harmful health effects of metals, pesticides, and dietary mold represented a context unique to Africa. Studies of exposures to phthalates, PFASs, phenols, and flame retardants were very limited. These results underscore the need for further focus on current and emerging environmental and chemical health risks as well as better integration of genomic and environmental factors in African research studies. Environmental exposures with distinct routes of exposure, unique co-exposures and co-morbidities, combined with the extensive genomic diversity in Africa may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms underlying complex disease and promising potential for translation to global public health. © Copyright © 2020 Joubert, Mantooth and McAllister.",alkyl group; heavy metal; perfluoroalkyl substance; pesticide; phenol; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; Africa; air pollution; ambient air pollution; cardiovascular disease; dust; e-waste; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental health; genetic risk; genome; health hazard; health impact assessment; health status; indoor air pollution; medical research; mold; occupational exposure; outcome assessment; peer review; population risk; publication; respiratory tract disease; Review

Many communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure. Objectives: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight directions for future research that would be the most likely to meaningfully increase knowledge. Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness of study results. Results: We identified 16 cohort (or case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate cancer, but the data are inconsistent. Discussion: Each study's design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative. © 2021",perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; water; adult; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; case control study; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; kidney cancer; male; malignant neoplasm; Medline; priority journal; prostate cancer; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review; testis cancer; kidney tumor; pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Water

Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, e.g. Nafion, are widely used in fuel cell technology; but, despite their success, they show some drawbacks such as high cost, limited operating temperature range and high methanol crossover. These limit their widespread commercial application in DMFCs. Such disadvantages are inspiring worldwide research activities for developing new PEM materials based on non-perfluorinated polymers as alternative to Nafion for DMFCs. A review of membrane properties is carried out on the basis of thermal stability, methanol crossover and proton conductivity. The analysis of DMFC performance covers perfluorosulfonic acid membranes (PFSA), sulfonated aromatic polymers (SAPs) and composite membranes. PFSA membranes are suitable materials in terms of power density, SAPs are more advantageous regarding the low methanol permeability and cost, whereas composite membranes are more appropriate for operation above 100 C. DMFC power density values reported in literature show that, although there are remarkable research efforts on this subject, the achieved results are not yet satisfying. Further work is especially necessary on non-perfluorinated polymers to improve performance and durability for an effective application in practical DMFC devices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The focus of the review was placed on the application of constructed wetlands as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system. The design parameters of the reported constructed wetlands including the physical configuration, hydraulic mode, vegetation species, and targeting pharmaceuticals were summarized. The removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals under different conditions in the wetlands were evaluated at the macroscopic level. In addition, the importance of the three main components of constructed wetlands (substrate, plants and microbes) for pharmaceutical removal was analyzed to elucidate the possible removal mechanisms involved. There is a general consensus among many researchers that constructed wetlands hold great potential of being used as an alternative secondary wastewater treatment system or as a wastewater polishing treatment system for the removal of pharmaceuticals, but relevant reported studies are scarce and are not conclusive in their findings. Current knowledge is limited on the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands, the removal mechanisms involved, the toxicity to constructed wetlands caused by pharmaceuticals, and the influences of certain important parameters (configuration design, hydraulic mode, temperature and seasonality, pH, oxygen and redox potential, etc.). This review promotes further research on these issues to provide more and better convincing evidences for the function and performance of larger laboratory-scale, pilot-scale or full-scale constructed wetlands. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Drug products; Polishing; Reclamation; Redox reactions; Research; Wastewater treatment; Configuration designs; Constructed wetlands; Emerging pollutants; Macroscopic levels; Pharmaceutical contaminants; Removal efficiencies; Vegetation species; Wastewater treatment system; Wetlands; amoxicillin; ampicillin; atenolol; caffeine; carbamazepine; clarithromycin; cotinine; diclofenac; doxycycline; enrofloxacin; erythromycin; fluoxetine; gemfibrozil; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; lincomycin; metoprolol; nadolol; naproxen; oxygen; paracetamol; propranolol; salicylic acid; sotalol; sulfadimethoxine; sulfamethoxazole; sulfapyridine; tetracycline; trimethoprim; constructed wetland; design; drug; laboratory method; parameterization; performance assessment; redox potential; substrate; waste treatment; wastewater; water treatment; effluent; oxidation reduction state; pH; pharmaceutical care; priority journal; review; seasonal variation; temperature; waste water management; water contamination; wetland; Constructed wetland; Emerging pollutant; Pharmaceutical; Wastewater treatment; Facility Design and Construction; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Wetlands"

Here, we review the published literature concerning PFAA impacts on neurobiological, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral outcomes. We find that there are many mechanisms through which PFAAs may enter the brain and interact with biochemical endpoints to impact neurological function. These results are supported by epidemiological evidence in humans and experimental evidence in animals that demonstrate numerous and varied PFAA impacts on the nervous system. However, the methods commonly used in animal models of PFAA exposure result in durations of exposure and serum PFAA concentrations in blood that may not appropriately mimic human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. If animal models lack validity, confidence in mechanistic inferences regarding PFAA exposure and brain function is reduced, limiting these studies’ utility. Finally, we end by suggesting some potential impacts of PFAA exposure in human neurological health and disease states whose associations may not readily present themselves in the epidemiological literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; absorption; blood level; body distribution; brain function; clinical outcome; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; excretion; health impact assessment; health status; human; nervous system; neuroendocrine system; neurologic disease; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; animal; animal model; brain; drug effect; nerve cell; pollutant; thyroid gland; toxicity; Animals; Brain; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Models, Animal; Neurons; Neurosecretory Systems; Thyroid Gland"

During pregnancy, SLE is associated with a high risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Among the most frequent complications are spontaneous abortion, fetal death, prematurity, intrauterine Fetal growth restriction (FGR), and preeclampsia (PE). The pathophysiology underlying obstetric mortality and morbidity in SLE is still under investigation, but several studies in recent years have suggested that placental dysfunction may play a crucial role. Understanding this association will contribute to developing therapeutic options and improving patient management thus reducing the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in this group of women. In this review, we will focus on the relationship between SLE and placental insufficiency leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes.

The requirements for such membranes are also summarized. Then, different strategies are given to synthesize anion-exchange polymeric materials containing cationic (especially ammonium) groups. The first pathway focuses on heterogeneous membranes that consist in: (i) polymer blends and composites based on poly(alkene oxide)s and hydroxide salts or polybenzimidazole doped with potassium hydroxide, (ii) organic-inorganic hybrid membranes especially those synthesized via a sol-gel process, and (iii) (semi)interpenetrated networks based on poly(epichlorhydrine), poly(acrylonitrile) and polyvinyl alcohol for example, that have led to new polymeric materials for anion-exchange membranes. The second and main part concerns the homogeneous membranes divided into three categories. The first one consists in materials synthesized from (co)polymers obtained via direct (co)polymerization, for example membranes based on poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). The second pathway concerns the modification of polymeric materials via radiografting or chemical reactions. These polymeric materials can be hydrogenated or halogenated. The radiografting of membranes means the irradiation via various sources - electron beam, X and γ rays, 60Co and 137Cs that lead to trapped radicals or macromolecular peroxides or hydroperoxides, followed by the radical graft polymerization of specific monomers such as chloromethyl styrene. The third route deals with the chemical modifications of commercially available hydrogenated aliphatic and aromatic (co)polymers, and the syntheses of fluorinated (co)polymers such as carboxylic and sulfonic perfluoropolymers. In addition, several approaches for the crosslinking of above-mentioned polymeric materials are also reported as this process enhances the properties of the resulting membranes.

While considerable progress has been made in this particular field of research, activating strong bonds, such as the C-F bond, continues to be a challenge. Because polyfluorinated compounds are commercially available, the functionalization of C-F bonds has been extensively studied for preparing partially fluorinated compounds, some of which are biologically active and are used as functionalized materials. However, chemo- and regioselective methods are still required to prepare useful partially fluorinated compounds. In addition, a new strategy for the activation of a C-F bond in less reactive monofluorinated compounds remains a need. Directed strategies have been extensively used in C-H bond activation chemistry to achieve high efficiency as well as a high regioselectivity. On the other hand, a directed strategy that is applicable to the activation of various unreactive bonds, such as C-O, C-N, C-F, and others is still needed, compared with directed C-H bond activation.

In wildlife, changes in the biotic and abiotic environment (e.g. salinity, temperature, reproductive stage, and health status) often lead to dynamic and responsive physiological changes that alter the prevalence and location of many proteins, including PFAS-related proteins. Therefore, we hypothesize that if key PFAS-related proteins are impacted as a result of environmentally induced as well as biologically programmed physiological changes (e.g. reproduction), then PFAS that associate with those proteins will also be impacted. Changes in tissue distribution across tissues of PFAS due to these dynamics may have implications for wildlife studies where these chemicals are measured in biological matrices (e.g., serum, feathers, eggs). For example, failure to account for factors contributing to PFAS variability in a tissue may result in exposure misclassification as measured concentrations may not reflect average exposure levels. The goal of this review is to share general information with the PFAS research community on what biotic and abiotic changes might be important to consider when designing and interpreting a biomonitoring or an ecotoxicity based wildlife study.

Overall, understanding these connections between biotic and abiotic environments, dynamic protein levels, PFAS levels measured in wildlife, and epidemiology serves to strengthen study design and study interpretation and thus strengthen conclusions derived from wildlife studies for years to come. © 2021","Cell proliferation; Fatty acids; Physiology; Proteins; Tissue; Abiotic; Biotics; Fatty acid-binding proteins; Organic anions; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Protein expressions; Reproductive health; Reproductive stage; Serum proteins; Study design; Animals; ABC transporter; albumin; fatty acid binding protein; lipid; lipoprotein; organic anion transporter; organofluorine derivative; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; phospholipid; plasma protein; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; abiotic factor; biomonitoring; biotic factor; gene expression; persistent organic pollutant; physiological response; protein; toxicity; wildlife management; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; body constitution; diet; diseases; ecotoxicity; environmental change; environmental exposure; excretion; health status; human; nonhuman; physiology; pregnancy; protein binding; protein expression; protein localization; reproduction; Review; salinity; seasonal variation; temperature; tissue distribution; toxicokinetics; wildlife; animal; wild animal; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biological Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Reproduction"

By opposition to structural elucidations benefitting from full data aspects, pharmacological evaluations are concerned with partial investigations resulting in sparse information. METHODS: The limited data availability was overcome by extensive consideration of several small sets of pharmacologically evaluated flavonoids in several plant taxa, alternatively to the traditional intensive analysis of big dataset of a given metabolic family in a given plant taxon. Statistical analyses were carried out using correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, box plots and fisher exact test to highlight structure-structure, structure-plant and structure-activity trends. RESULTS: Different aglycone types showed opposite trends between hydroxylation (flavonols, anthocyanidins, flavanols), and methoxylation (isoflavones, isoflavanes, neoflavones). Moreover, different carbons showed differential substitution levels in different aglycones: C3 in flavonols, C6, C8 in flavones, flavonols, C2' in flavanones, C6' in isoflavanes. Plant families were well differentiated by different relative occurrences of aglycones: flavones in Lamiaceae, flavanones in Rutaceae, neoflavones in Rubiaceae, flavonols in Asteraceae, isoflavones in Fabaceae. Relatively more hydroxylated flavonoids occurred in Asteraceae, Lamiaceae and Fabaceae vs. more methoxylated ones in Rutaceae and Rubiaceae. Concerning structure-activity trends, flavanols and isoflavones were relatively more concerned with anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities, respectively, vs. balanced distribution of flavones. Anti-inflammatory activity showed significant association with substitution position of same chemical groups (OH, OCH3), whereas anti-diabetic activity was revealed to be mainly influenced by the type of chemical groups (positive effect of OH and glycosyls). CONCLUSION: These results call for regular updates and further investigations.

Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries’ systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Food supply; Health risks; Losses; Planning; Runoff; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water pollution; Carbon sequestration; Emerging pollutants; Landscape integration; Literature reviews; Low impact development; Resources recycling; Sustainable agriculture; Urban drainage systems; Sustainable development; storm water; adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; food supply; mitigation; nutrient cycling; pollutant removal; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; urban drainage; urbanization; air pollution; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; catchment area (hydrology); catering service; climate change; climate resilience; drought; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; human; hydraulic conductivity; hydropower; land use; natural resource; nutrient cycling; peak expiratory flow; public policy; recycling; Review; runoff; soil moisture; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development goal; United Nations; urbanization; waste water recycling; water quality; water treatment; watershed

The complement system, a crucial part of innate immunity, plays an important role in this process. Thus, apoptotic and necrotic cells are recognized by complement initiators such as C1q, mannose binding lectin, ficolins, and properdin. This triggers complement activation and opsonization of cells with fragments of C3b, which enhances phagocytosis and thus ensures silent removal. Importantly, the process is tightly controlled by the binding of complement inhibitors C4b-binding protein and factor H, which attenuates late steps of complement activation and inflammation. Furthermore, factor H becomes actively internalized by apoptotic cells, where it catalyzes the cleavage of intracellular C3 to C3b. The intracellularly derived C3b additionally opsonizes the cell surface further supporting safe and fast clearance and thereby aids to prevent autoimmunity. Internalized factor H also binds nucleosomes and directs monocytes into production of anti-inflammatory cytokines upon phagocytosis of such complexes. Disturbances in the complement-mediated clearance of dying cells result in persistence of autoantigens and development of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, and may also be involved in development of age-related macula degeneration. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Magnetic resonance methods based on the paramagnetism of oxygen have the advantage of using great electromagnetic wavelengths, which present an important penetration in aqueous samples, and display no scattering in condensed matter. The transverse relaxation time (T2) of water protons is decreased by the paramagnetism of deoxyhaemoglobin, wich is inversely related to the blood oxygen concentration. A tremendous amount of work is currently being done using this blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect. The exchangeable imidazole proton of the proximal histidine of haemoglobin yields a more specific signal, which is directly related to the paramagnetism of deoxyhaemoglobin and reflects the oxygen concentration more accurately than the T2 of water protons. Perfluorocarbon emulsions are blood substitutes which can be used to measure precisely the oxygen content of blood. Unpaired electrons of the free radical probes can also be used for sensitive oxymetry purposes thanks to bimolecular collisions between the oxygen and free radical molecules, which alter, specifically, the electron paramagnetic resonance of the radical. Dynamic nuclear polarisation, which combines the sensitivity to oxygen of EPR and the tractability of NMR imaging, is a potential means of achieving localised oxymetry. The principles and recent applications of these magnetic resonance methods to the measurement of oxygen concentrations in biology are reviewed here, in order to underline the advantages and difficulties of each method. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Its agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, exhibits multiple mechanisms to evade the host immune response and infect host cells. An important immune evasion strategy of T. cruzi infective stages is its capacity to inhibit the complement system activation on the parasite surface, avoiding opsonizing, immune stimulating and lytic effects. Epimastigotes, the non-infective form of the parasite, present in triatomine arthropod vectors, are highly susceptible to complement-mediated lysis while trypomastigotes, the infective form, present in host bloodstream, are resistant. Thus T. cruzi susceptibility to complement varies depending on the parasite stage (amastigote, trypomastigotes or epimastigote) and on the T. cruzi strain. To avoid complement-mediated lysis, T. cruzi trypomastigotes express on the parasite surface a variety of complement regulatory proteins, such as glycoprotein 58/68 (gp58/68), T. cruzi complement regulatory protein (TcCRP), trypomastigote decay-accelerating factor (T-DAF), C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning (CRIT) and T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT). Alternatively, or concomitantly, the parasite captures components with complement regulatory activity from the host bloodstream, such as factor H (FH) and plasma membrane-derived vesicles (PMVs). All these proteins inhibit different steps of the classical (CP), alternative (AP) or lectin pathways (LP). Thus, TcCRP inhibits the CP C3 convertase assembling, gp58/68 inhibits the AP C3 convertase, T-DAF interferes with the CP and AP convertases assembling, TcCRT inhibits the CP and LP, CRIT confers ability to resist the CP and LP, FH is used by trypomastigotes to inhibit the AP convertases and PMVs inhibit the CP and LP C3 convertases. Many of these proteins have similar molecular inhibitory mechanisms. Our laboratory has contributed to elucidate the role of TcCRT in the host-parasite interplay. Thus, we have proposed that TcCRT is a pleiotropic molecule, present not only in the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, but also on the trypomastigote surface, participating in key processes to establish T. cruzi infection, such as inhibition of the complement system and serving as an important virulence factor. Additionally, TcCRT interaction with key complement components, participates as an anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor molecule, inhibiting at least in important part, tumor growth in infected animals. © 2017 Ramírez-Toloza and Ferreira.",C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning protein; calreticulin; classical complement pathway C3 C5 convertase; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C5; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement factor H; complement regulatory protein; decay accelerating factor; glycoprotein; glycoprotein 58/68; lectin; membrane protein; sialic acid; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; amastigote; bloodstream infection; cancer inhibition; cell vacuole; complement system; enzyme activity; epimastigote; exosome; host parasite interaction; human; intracellular signaling; nonhuman; phagocytosis; plasma membrane derived vesicle; protein binding; protein expression; Review; Trypanosoma cruzi; trypomastigote

However, currently we only have limited information about their eco-toxicological impacts on the ecosystem and human beings. For this reason, it is important to assess the contamination levels of common POPs (DDT, HCH, HCB, PCB, heptachlor, and ∑PFAAs, PFOA, PFOS) and their damaging impacts on the health of people and ecosystems in Bangladesh. Admittedly, POPs are extremely resistant to natural decomposition in the environment and remain in the aquatic environment, soil, food cycles, and finally in the human body for decades even after production has stopped. POPs are proven to adversely affect people's health. Indeed, they can disrupt endocrine, reproductive, immune and nervous systems as well as cause behavioral problems, diabetes, thyroid problems, and even cancer. As well, these contaminants interrupt the food chain and resist vital physiological functions in the long term. Therefore, investigations of environmental and ecological impacts of POPs on physiological functions of the human body are urgently required. This review paper aims to summarize the environmental toxicity levels of POPs in Bangladesh and their lethal concentrations which are creating diseases through the destruction of the human body's vital organs.

It is expected that the combination of anticancer drugs and drug delivery systems, using polymers to increase the access of such agents to their site of action, will improve the efficacy of therapy. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a polymer used as a co-delivery system for anticancer drugs and gene therapy. PEI is also useful for other purposes, such as transfection and bio-adsorbent agents. In co-delivery, PEI can promote drug internalization. However, PEI with a high molecular weight is linked to higher cytotoxicity, thus requiring further evaluation of clinical safety. This review focuses on the utilization of PEI as a co-delivery system for anticancer therapy, as well as its potential to overcome resistance, particularly in the treatment of specific subtypes (eg, breast cancer). In conclusion, PEI has promising applications and is improvable for the development of anticancer drugs. © 2022 Fahira et al.",CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epirubicin; folic acid; hyaluronic acid; methotrexate; perfluorodecalin; polyethyleneimine; retinoic acid; short hairpin RNA; apoptosis; bioavailability; breast cancer; cancer inhibition; cancer therapy; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; drug adsorption; drug bioavailability; drug delivery system; drug selectivity; endocytosis; gene therapy; genetic transfection; human; internalization (cell); nonhuman; nucleic acid internalization; Review; RNA interference; RNAi therapeutics

Hemoglobin-based solutions and fluorocarbons are currently under clinical investigation. Hemoglobin solutions are produced from different sources with various difficulties. The major sources of hemoglobin solutions available today are human blood, bovine blood and recombinant hemoglobin. Whatever the origin, hemoglobin solutions must be highly purified, have a normal affinity for oxygen and a sufficiently long intravascular half-life. Biochemical or genetic modifications of the hemoglobin molecule have fulfilled these criteria. Most solutions have already been tested in hemorrhagic shock models with positive results. However, a vasoconstrictive effect which is at least partly dependent upon the ability of hemoglobin to capture NO, has been demonstrated in these studies. Fluorocarbons represent another approach in the search for blood substitutes. Available preparations are highly concentrated and stable at room temperature. Fluorocarbons are prepared as lipid emulsions which are practically ready to use. Oxygen transport with fluorocarbon is a function of fluocrit and PO2. Interestingly, fluorocarbons may improve oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. In combination with perioperative blood conservation techniques, blood substitutes should increase the margin of safety of normovolemic hemodilution and decrease the exposure to allogenic blood. The acute phase of myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary bypass and liquid ventilation are other potential applications of blood substitutes. The results of ongoing clinical investigations should help establish indications and modalities of use.",blood substitute; fluorocarbon; fluosol; hemoglobin; oxyfluor; perfluorooctyl bromide; pluronique f68; unclassified drug; bleeding; blood transfusion; hemodilution; human; oxygen transport; review

Immobilization of biomolecules onto polymer surfaces and the construction of bioconjugates are essential requirements of many biochemical assays and chemical syntheses. Different linkers with a variety of functional groups are used for these purposes. Among them, the benzophenones, aryldiazirines, and arylazides represent the most commonly used photolinker to produce the desired chemical linkage upon their photo-irradiation. In this review, we describe the versatile applications of 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl azide, one of the oldest photolinkers used for photoaffinity labeling in the late 1960s. Surprisingly, this photolinker, historically known as 1-fluoro-2-nitro-4-azidobenzene (FNAB), has remained unexplored for a long time because of apprehension that FNAB forms ring-expanded dehydroazepine as a major product and hence cannot activate an inert polymer. The first evidence of photochemical activation of an inert surface by FNAB through nitrene insertion reaction was reported in 2001, and the FNAB-activated surface was found to conjugate a biomolecule without any catalyst, reagent, or modification. FNAB has distinct advantages over perfluorophenyl azide derivatives, which are contemporary nitrene-generating photolinkers, because of its simple, single-step preparation and ease of thermochemical and photochemical reactions with versatile polymers and biomolecules. Covering these aspects, the present review highlights the flexible chemistry of FNAB and its applications in the field of surface engineering, immobilization of biomolecules such as antibodies, enzymes, cells, carbohydrates, oligonucleotides, and DNA aptamers, and rapid diagnostics.

This paper reviews quantification of [NH3] through measurements, satellite-remote-sensing, and modeling reported in over 500 publications towards synthesizing the current knowledge of [NH3], focusing on spatiotemporal variations, controlling processes, and quantification issues. Most measurements are through regional passive sampler networks. [NH3] hotspots are typically over agricultural regions, such as the Midwest US and the North China Plain, with elevated concentrations reaching monthly averages of 20 and 74 ppbv, respectively. Topographical effects dramatically increase [NH3] over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, North India and San Joaquin Valley, US. Measurements are sparse over oceans, where [NH3] ≈ a few tens of pptv, variations of which can affect aerosol formation. Satellite remote-sensing (AIRS, CrIS, IASI, TANSO-FTS, TES) provides global [NH3] quantification in the column and at the surface since 2002. Modeling is crucial for improving understanding of NH3 chemistry and transport, its spatiotemporal variations, source apportionment, exploring physicochemical mechanisms, and predicting future scenarios. GEOS-Chem (global) and FRAME (UK) models are commonly applied for this. A synergistic approach of measurements↔satellite-inference↔modeling is needed towards improved understanding of atmospheric ammonia, which is of concern from the standpoint of human health and the ecosystem. © 2020 by the authors.

Besides direct industrial or human-derived contamination, nitrosodimethylamine can be formed through a chemical reaction between monochloro-amine and an organic-based compound such as dimethylamine which is frequently detected in surface water. It has been suggested that chloramination of surface waters with a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could result in elevated NDMA formation.

As a consequence of eutrophication, microcystins have become widely disseminated in drinking water sources, seriously impairing drinking water quality. This review focuses on the relationship between microcystins synthesis and physical, chemical, and biological environmental factors that are significant in controlling their production. Light intensity and temperature are the more important physical factors, and in many cases, an optimum level for these two factors has been observed. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the key chemical factors causing frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms and microcystins production. The absorption of nutrients and metabolic activities of algae are affected by different concentrations and forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, leading to variations in microcystins production Metal ions and emerging pollutants are other significant chemical factors, whose comprehensive impact is still being studied. Algae can also interact with biological agents like predators and competitors in aquatic environments, and such interactions are suggested to promote MCs production and release.

In the present review, the occurrence of PFAAs and their behavior in aquatic ecosystem were summarized, and the health and ecological risk assessment and the multimedia fate simulation were investigated. PFAAs are most likely to exist in the aqueous phase, and PFAAs in atmosphere are also able to enter water bodies through diffusion and wet and dry deposition and eventually become widely distributed in various environmental media. The air-solid partition is considered to be one of the major factors in the long-distance transportation of the pollutants. The pKa values and organic carbon fraction of the sediment could influence the partition of PFAAs between water and sediment. Otherwise, PFAAs have teratogenic, mutagenic and other toxic effects and they could be accumulated by biota, and magnified through trophic level. The ecological and health risks of PFOA and PFOS were assessment. In order to explore the partition mechanism and reduce the uncertainty of the simulation of the transport, transformation and fate, the experimental methods on physicochemical properties of PFAAs should be developed.

As a member of this family, the salicylic acid derivative known in the literature as 2-hydroxy-5-octanoyl benzoic acid or β-lipohydroxy acid has also been proposed as an exfoliant and as a treatment of photoaged skin and acne. This article reviews the effects of the hydroxy acids and compares them to those of the salicylic acid derivative. We propose the name C8-lipohydroxy acid (C8-LHA) for this derivative to differentiate it from other related compounds. The lipophilic nature of C8-LHA and its relatively slow penetration in the skin afford it an exfoliating effect that is efficient at low concentrations. It appears to have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticomedogenic properties, which make it effective against acne.

A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low-quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very-low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3. CFOs versus PFOs (1 trial, 108 participants): low-quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 28 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD -1.5, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.22). Low-quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index - FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD -18.55, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68), child-rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 25.8) and parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI -4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD -1.33 seconds, 95% CI -2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 25 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.98). Low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI-disability MD -4.17, 95% CI -24.4 to 16.06), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -3.84, 95% CI -19 to 11.33), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -0.64, 95% CI -13.22 to 11.94). 3. CFOs versus PFsO (2 trials, 87 participants): low-quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD -1.48, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI-disability MD -7.28, 95% CI -15.47 to 0.92), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI -3.9 to 21.2), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI -11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions: Low to very low-certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high-cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re-directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable.

Inspired by abundant yet diffuse solar energy and applications such as clean water and energy, ample motivation has provided the background for this situation. However, substantial fundamental (e. g., charge transfer, recombination), engineering (e. g., observed rates, photon management), and practical barriers (e. g., use of precious metals, competing technologies) have limited implementation. In this review, these are all outlined, in conjunction with typical strategies for improvements, with an emphasis on the use of semiconductor photocatalysts for the degradation of emerging forever chemical contaminants in water. The selected classes of forever chemical contaminants are (micro)-plastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs), siloxanes, and dioxanes. Each has been identified as a key or emerging contaminant and often travel widely while accumulating in the atmosphere due to the lack of natural remediation processes. Recommendations to the field and opportunities for contributions are highlighted throughout and as part of the outlook to the future. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",NA

In this review manuscript, a holistic view of water quality degradation such as concerned pollutants, source of pollution, and its consequences in major river basins around the globe (at least 1 from each continent and a total of 16 basins) is presented. Additionally, nine contemporary techniques such as field scale evaluation, watershed scale evaluation, strategies to identify critical source areas, optimization strategies for placement of best management practices (BMPs), social component in watershed modeling, machine learning algorithms to address water quality problems in complex natural systems concomitant with spatial heterogeneity, establishing a total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), remote sensing in monitoring water quality, and developing water quality index are discussed. Next, the existing barriers to improve water quality are classified into primary and secondary impediments. A detail discussion of three primary impediments (climate change, urbanization and industrial activities, and agriculture) and ten secondary impediments (availability of water quality data, complexity of system, lack of skilled person, environmental legislation, fragmented mandate, limitation in resources, environmental awareness, resistance to change, alteration of nutrient ratio by river damming, and emerging pollutants) are illustrated. Finally, considering all the existing knowledge gaps pertaining to contemporary strategies, a future direction of water quality research is outlined to significantly improve the water quality around the globe. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Agricultural robots; Climate change; Laws and legislation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quality control; Remote sensing; Rivers; Water quality; Water treatment; Watersheds; Best management practice (BMPs); Contemporary techniques; Environmental awareness; Environmental legislations; Monitoring water quality; Total maximum daily load; Water quality degradation; Water quality improvements; River pollution; algorithm; best management practice; climate change; eutrophication; literature review; machine learning; remote sensing; river basin; strategic approach; twenty first century; water quality; adult; agriculture; awareness; climate change; eutrophication; human; law; machine learning; nutrient; pollutant; remote sensing; review; river basin; urbanization; water quality; watershed; environmental monitoring; prospective study; river; urbanization; water pollution; Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Prospective Studies; Rivers; Urbanization; Water Pollution; Water Quality

Radical chain reactions of RFI are readily initiated by azonitrile initiators and this process generally gives pure products from unsaturated compounds of many types; the process is called iodoperfluoroalkylation. In the synthesis of fluorine containing organic compounds, few methods can compare with the efficiency, cost, selectivity and versatility of free radical addition of RFI. Part one reviews all aspects of the generation of RF radicals from RFI for synthetic purposes and reports the relative reactivity of RFI and of 20 typical alkenes or alkynes. Practical syntheses of 16 different classes of alkenes and alkynes are illustrated by examples and comprehensive tables of experimental data. Special emphasis is given to novel and important uses for many of these new perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds. The aim of this review is to bring together in one place the results of research with RFI as an entry into the synthesis of fluorine containing organic compounds, over a fifty year time span.

It is actively involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including skin diseases, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, foreign microorganisms, altered tissue cells, and the presence of mannan. Complement is intended to kill invading microorganisms but it can also destroy the organism's own damaged or altered cells. It is characterized by vigorous activity and is also potentially harmful for the host if triggered in its own body. This review discusses the significance of complement activation for emerging skin diseases and highlights the importance of serological laboratory tests for the detection of complement system activity alterations in skin diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, dermatitis herpetiformis, porphyria, urticaria, angioedema, cutaneous vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, partial lipodystrophy, lichen planus, xeroderma pigmentosum, psoriasis, and recurrent cutaneous infections.

PFCs are used for two major medical indications: as artificial blood substitutes and as a medium for liquid ventilation. The PFC perflubron is additionally used as a contrast medium for diagnostic radiologic procedures. For the intravenous application perfluorocarbons have to be emulgated in phospholipids for the intrapulmonary application the sterile pure solution is used. Liquid ventilation can either be performed by a method known as total liquid ventilation (TLV), in which a device is utilised to ventilate with perfluorocarbon the previously perfluorocarbon-filled lung, or as partial liquid ventilation (PLV) in which a conventional mechanical gas ventilator is used to gas ventilate the partially perfluorocarbon-filled lung. A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of perfluorocarbon liquid ventilation in improving gas exchange and pulmonary function in a number of animal species in the setting of acute respiratory failure. In 1989 Greenspan reported on the first human liquid ventilation experience in a neonate. More recently human experiences for neonatal, paediatric and adult patients with acute lung injury have been reported. Since 1995 an FDA-approved study to examine the efficacy of PLV in severe respiratocy failure in patients of all ages has been undertaken in the United States. The number of PLV-treated patients is still small; if PLV demonstrates its efficacy even in the ongoing human studies, it might be a very effective additional tool for treating severe acute lung injury.","contrast medium; fluorocarbon; artificial ventilation; aspiration; bronchoscopy; gas exchange; human; inhalation anesthesia; lung injury; respiratory failure; review; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal; child; equipment design; instrumentation; lung gas exchange; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; newborn; oxygen therapy; pathophysiology; physiology; respiratory failure; treatment outcome; Adult; Animals; Child; Equipment Design; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn; Respiratory Insufficiency; Treatment Outcome"

Despite the limited number of reports, the FBS hydrosilylation reaction has been extremely successful. In all cases fluorous monophosphines (either alkylic or perfluoroalkylsilyl-substituted derivatives of triphenylphosphine) have been employed as ligands to synthesize and inmobilize the metal catalysts (either rhodium(I) or gold(I) derivatives) in the fluorous solvent (including a fluorous ionic liquid). The hydrosilylation of alkenes, ketones and enones with fluorous rhodium analogs to the Wilkinson's catalyst [RhCl(PPh3) 3], have afforded high TON/TOF and a very efficient separation and recycling of the fluorous catalyst. Modification of the fluorous content and position of the fluorous tails in the aryl groups of the phosphines have allowed for further optimization of the process and a better recovery of the catalyst with minimal leaching of rhodium and fluorous ligand to the organic phase. Moreover, the use of the so-called second generation methods which eliminate the need of fluorous solvents by exploiting the temperature-dependent solubilities of fluorous catalysts in common organic solvents (thermomorphic properties) have permitted the use and separation of fluorous alkyl-phosphine rhodium catalysts in hydrosilylation reactions in conventional organic solvents. The addition of an insoluble fluorous support such as Teflon tape allowed for an exceptionally easy and efficient recovery of fluorous rhodium catalysts (""catalyst-on-a- tape"") in the hydrosilylation of ketones. In the case of the FBS gold-catalyzed hydrosilylation of aldehydes, new fluorous gold catalysts with alkylic phosphines have led to an efficient separation and recycling of the gold catalysts although the TON/TOF are lower than in the rhodium-catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes and ketones. A detailed study of the non-fluorous gold-catalyzed version has helped to explain how this catalytic system could be improved. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA

Over the course of his scientific career, Eckhard R. Podack made several seminal discoveries that elucidated key aspects of this warfare at a molecular level. When Eckhard joined the complement laboratory of Müller-Eberhard in 1974, he was fascinated by two questions: (1) what is the molecular mechanism by which complement kills invasive bacteria? and (2) which one of the complement components is the killer molecule? Eckhard's quest to answer these questions would lead to the discovery C9 and later, two additional pore-forming killer molecules of the immune system. Here is a brief account of how he discovered poly-C9, the pore-forming protein of complement in blood and interstitial fluids: Perforin-1, expressed by natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; and Perforin-2 (MPEG1), expressed by all cell types examined to date. All the three killing systems are crucial for our survival and health. © 2016 Podack and Munson.",complement component C3; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; decay accelerating factor; lymphotoxin; perforin; tumor necrosis factor; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; electron microscopy; immunity; microorganism; natural killer cell; neoplasm; nonhuman; Review; ultracentrifugation

Major sources of PFAS in the environment include fire-fighting foams (aqueous film forming foam (AFFF)), wastewater sources, biosolids, and composts. Limited information is available about PFAS in wastewater, which is the focus of this review. PFAS wastewater sources include domestic effluents, industrial effluents, landfill leachates, stormwater, and agricultural effluents through their use in various applications. Land application of PFAS-contaminated wastewater can lead to the contamination of soil and groundwater, thereby reaching the food chain through plant uptake and consumption of potable water. Landfill leachates and industrial effluents contain the highest concentrations of PFAS, posing serious risks to surrounding waterways. Transformation of PFAS precursors can occur through abiotic and biotic processes within the treatment of wastewater, resulting in the formation of harmful PFAS compounds. Currently, there is limited data reported on novel short-chain and ultra-short chain PFAS and PFAS precursors. The strong thermal and chemical stability of PFAS and the complex nature of PFAS mixtures makes the remediation of PFAS in wastewater challenging. However, the review examines and compares current technologies which can treat and remove PFAS from wastewaters.

The first stage of cell division is the formation of a Z ring, composed of a polymerized tubulin-like protein, FtsZ, at the division site precisely at midcell. Several membrane-associated division proteins are then recruited to this ring to form a complex, the divisome, which causes invagination of the cell envelope layers to form a division septum. The Z ring marks the future division site, and the timing of assembly and positioning of this structure are important in determining where and when division will take place in the cell. Z ring assembly is controlled by many factors including negative regulatory mechanisms such as Min and nucleoid occlusion that influence Z ring positioning and FtsZ accessory proteins that bind to FtsZ directly and modulate its polymerization behavior. The replication status of the cell also influences the positioning of the Z ring, which may allow the tight coordination between DNA replication and cell division required to produce two identical newborn cells. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

PFOA is extremely resistant to environmental degradation processes and thus persists indefinitely. Unlike most other persistent and bioaccumulative organic pollutants, PFOA is water-soluble, does not bind well to soil or sediments, and bioaccumulates in serum rather than in fat. It has been detected in finished drinking water and drinking water sources impacted by releases from industrial facilities and waste water treatment plants, as well as in waters with no known point sources. However, the overall occurrence and population exposure from drinking water is not known. PFOA persists in humans with a half-life of several years and is found in the serum of almost all U.S. residents and in populations worldwide. Exposure sources include food, food packaging, consumer products, house dust, and drinking water. Continued exposure to even relatively low concentrations in drinking water can substantially increase total human exposure, with a serum:drinking water ratio of about 100:1. For example, ongoing exposures to drinking water concentrations of 10. ng/L, 40. ng/L, 100 ng/L, or 400 ng/L are expected to increase mean serum levels by about 25%, 100%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively, from the general population background serum level of about 4. ng/mL. Infants are potentially a sensitive subpopulation for PFOA's developmental effects, and their exposure through breast milk from mothers who use contaminated drinking water and/or from formula prepared with contaminated drinking water is higher than in adults exposed to the same drinking water concentration. Numerous health endpoints are associated with human PFOA exposure in the general population, communities with contaminated drinking water, and workers. As is the case for most such epidemiology studies, causality for these effects is not proven. Unlike most other well-studied drinking water contaminants, the human dose-response curve for several effects appears to be steepest at the lower exposure levels, including the general population range, with no apparent threshold for some endpoints. There is concordance in animals and humans for some effects, while humans and animals appear to react differently for other effects such as lipid metabolism. PFOA was classified as ""likely to be carcinogenic in humans"" by the USEPA Science Advisory Board. In animal studies, developmental effects have been identified as more sensitive endpoints for toxicity than carcinogenicity or the long-established hepatic effects. Notably, exposure to an environmentally relevant drinking water concentration caused adverse effects on mammary gland development in mice. This paper reviews current information relevant to the assessment of PFOA as an emerging drinking water contaminant. This information suggests that continued human exposure to even relatively low concentrations of PFOA in drinking water results in elevated body burdens that may increase the risk of health effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","drinking water; perfluorooctanoate ammonium; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; uric acid; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; bioaccumulation; carcinogen; concentration (composition); drinking water; environmental degradation; epidemiology; health risk; hepatitis; literature review; metabolism; organic acid; organic pollutant; point source pollution; pollution effect; pollution exposure; water treatment; blood analysis; breast milk; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; cognition; concentration (parameters); consumer; exposure; fluorination; food packaging; house dust; human; immune system; liver; mammary gland; nonhuman; population research; priority journal; reproduction; review; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; United States; uric acid blood level; waste water management; water contamination; water supply; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Octanoic Acids; United States; Water Pollutants, Chemical; United States; Animalia; Mus"

Direct sample analysis of OF only applies to some techniques on consumer products, whereas others require sample pre-treatment or concentration before measurements. Comparison between methods for OF analysis were found to be difficult because of different selectivity (between OF and fluoride), sensitivity and type of samples (bulk, extract, surface) analysed. Neither inter-laboratory comparison on OF analysis nor suitable certified reference materials have been used for method validation, which makes data comparability between studies challenging. A top down approach for the comprehensive assessment of OF is proposed, where OF/extractable OF is first measured, followed by target analysis to obtain unquantifiable OF concentrations using the mass balance approach. For further identification of unquantifiable OF, approaches such as total oxidizable precursor assay, suspect and non-target screening are briefly discussed. © 2019 The Authors",Consumer products; Fluorine compounds; Inductively coupled plasma; Ion chromatography; Combustion ion chromatography; Gamma-ray emission; Mass balance; Organofluorine; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Gamma rays; fluoride; organofluorine derivative; sodium biphenyl; sodium derivative; unclassified drug; absorption spectroscopy; analytic method; assay; chemical analysis; combustion ion chromatography; continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry; defluorination; fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance; food packaging; gamma spectrometry; human; instrumental neutron activation analysis; ion chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; liquid liquid extraction; neutron activation analysis; non target analysis; particle induced gamma ray emission spectroscopy; priority journal; pyrolysis; reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; Review; screening test; solid phase extraction; suspect screening analysis; total oxidizable precursor assay; validation process; X ray photoemission spectroscopy

Upon ligand binding, PPARs dimerize with retinoid receptors, translocate to the nucleus, recognize specific PP-responsive elements on DNA and transactivate a number of genes. Several processes are regulated by PPARs, such as mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation, inflammation, intracellular lipid trafficking, cell proliferation and death. In addition, PPARs have been proposed to act as tumor suppressors or as tumor promoters, depending on the circumstances. In particular, PPs have been extensively studied for their hepatocarcinogenic action in rodents, most often ascribed to their antiapoptotic action. Recent evidence, however, has been provided about the antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and differentiation-promoting activities displayed by PPAR ligands. The present review will focus on the cytotoxic effects exerted by several PPs, among which clofibrate, on different types of tumor cells, with particular reference to the mechanisms of cell death and to their relevance to cancer induction and progression. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","15 deoxy delta12,14 prostaglandin J2; [4 [2 (3 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl) 4 methyl 5 thiazolylmethylthio] 2 methylphenoxy]acetic acid; ciglitazone; clofibrate; conjugated linoleic acid; nafenopin; netoglitazone; perfluorooctanoic acid; peroxisome proliferator; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; pirinixic acid; pirinixil; rosiglitazone; tdz 18; troglitazone; unclassified drug; cancer growth; cell death; cell proliferation; DNA responsive element; drug cytotoxicity; drug receptor binding; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; human; hyperlipidemia; inflammation; lipid transport; liver carcinogenesis; mitochondrion; nonhuman; peroxisome; protein transport; review; transactivation; Animals; Clofibrate; Cytotoxins; Disease Progression; Humans; Neoplasms; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Peroxisome Proliferators"

It highlights human population-based associations as well as in vitro-based experimental data to inform an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these health effects. Among the mechanisms by which PFAS may induce toxicity is via their interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism and placental functions important to healthy pregnancies, as well as fetal and child development. Recent Findings: In utero exposure to prevalent environmental contaminants such as PFAS is associated with negative health outcomes during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and later in life. Specifically, PFAS have been associated with increased incidence of gestational diabetes, childhood obesity, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. In terms of placental molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, studies demonstrate that PFAS interfere with trophoblast lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and invasion. Moreover these effects could be mediated in part by the interaction between PFAS and PPARs, as well as other biological mechanisms. Summary: This review summarizes how PFAS, critical environmental contaminants, may contribute to diseases of pregnancy as well as early and later child health. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","fluorocarbon; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; adult; adverse event; child; child development; child health; drug effect; environmental exposure; female; fetus; human; maternal exposure; metabolism; placenta; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; prenatal exposure; Adult; Child; Child Development; Child Health; Diabetes, Gestational; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal Exposure; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Placenta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"

To overcome these problems, perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers as well as acellular-and cellular-type, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been developed for use as artificial oxygen carriers. Despite their extensive evaluation, including formulation and pharmacology, they have not been extensively used in clinical settings. One of the reasons for this is that their pharmacokinetics have not been well characterized. Artificial oxygen carriers require not only an acceptable level of physicochemical activity, but also clinical efficacy, as reflected by their retention in the circulation, and the absence of measurable accumulation in the body, if unexpected adverse effects are to be avoided.

Recently, complement and complement receptors have been reported to play an important role in the regulation of innate as well as adaptive immune responses during infection. The regulation of host immune responses by complement involves modulation of dendritic cell activity in addition to direct effects on T-cell function. Intriguingly, many viruses encode homologs of complement regulatory molecules or proteins that interact with complement receptors on antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. The evolution of viral mechanisms to alter complement function may augment pathogen persistence and limit immune-mediated tissue destruction. These observations suggest that complement may play an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection as well as virus-mediated modulation of host immunity. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","CD18 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD59 antigen; CD8 antigen; CD86 antigen; chemokine receptor CCR5; chemokine receptor CCR7; complement; complement component C1q; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3b; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C3d; complement component C3d receptor; complement component C4b; complement component C5a; complement component C5a receptor; complement component C5b; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement receptor; decay accelerating factor; glycoprotein p 15095; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 12; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; membrane cofactor protein; unindexed drug; adaptive immunity; antigen presentation; antigen presenting cell; complement activation; dendritic cell; host; immunomodulation; immunoregulation; inflammation; innate immunity; nonhuman; review; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; virus immunity; virus infection; virus particle; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Complement System Proteins; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Receptors, Complement; T-Lymphocytes; Viruses"

Therefore, the possible advantages of a synthetic meniscal substitute over allografts, such as availability and freedom from disease transmission, are overshadowed by factors such as sizing problems, inferior material properties and wear. Using some of the available materials, such as Dacron and Teflon, knee joint stability with intact cruciate ligaments seems to be a basic requirement for the incorporation and fixation of the synthetic material into the biological environment. Similar to using allografts or biological implants, normal posterior and anterior attachment sites could not be reconstructed with the synthetic materials, which may be one of the main causes of insufficient cartilage preservation after meniscal substitution. Further, it was shown that synthetic implants without a polyurethane coating failed because of wear and changes in shape; meanwhile the coated, more inflexible implants often caused osteophyte formation and synovitis. In conclusion, with the materials and designs tested the concept of a permanent meniscal prosthesis does not seem clinically applicable at the moment. Nevertheless, the beneficial effects on cartilage preservation which were seen with slight improvements in prosthesis size, design and material properties may point to a future potential for this concept. © 1994.","biomaterial; dacron; politef; polyurethan; allograft; biocompatibility; disease transmission; endoprosthesis; joint stability; knee; knee cruciate ligament; knee meniscus; osteophyte; priority journal; review; surgical technique; synovitis; Animal; Biocompatible Materials; Human; Knee Prosthesis; Menisci, Tibial; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Synovitis"

Methods: We systematically reviewed original, quantitative studies of patients', research participants', or journal readers' views about FTs to pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for English-language studies containing original, quantitative data on attitudes toward FTs. We screened 6561 citations and retrieved 244 potentially eligible abstracts. Of these, 20 met inclusion criteria. Results: Eleven studies assessed FTs and perceptions of quality. In clinical care, patients believed FTs decreased the quality and increased the cost of care. In research, FTs affected perceptions of study quality. In 2 studies, readers' perceptions of journal article quality decreased after disclosure of FTs. Eight studies assessed the acceptability of FTs. Patients were more likely to view personal gifts to physicians as unacceptable, compared with professional gifts. In 6 of the 10 studies that assessed the importance of disclosure, most patients and research participants believed FTs should be disclosed; in the other 4, approximately one-quarter believed FTs should be disclosed. Among the 7 studies assessing willingness to participate in research, approximately one-quarter of participants reported less willingness after disclosure of FTs. Conclusions: Patients believe that FTs influence professional behavior and should be disclosed. Patients, physicians, and research participants believe FTs decrease the quality of research evidence, and, for some, knowledge of FTs would affect willingness to participate in research. ©2010 American Medical Association.

There are vast applications of hydrophobic membranes such as filtration, gas separation, membrane gas absorption, pervaporation, membrane distillation and more that cannot be attained with hydrophilic membranes. However, the development of hydrophobic membranes was relatively slow in the past, as membrane technologists and researchers were more interested in reducing membrane hydrophobicity for permeability enhancement or fouling control in the aqueous separation. Thus, literature related to hydrophobic membranes has not been reviewed elsewhere. This review reported on the characterization and preparation methods for hydrophobic membranes. Hydrophobic ceramic membranes are commonly prepared by chemical modification. Besides using different types of chemicals, the membrane surface is roughened to enhance its hydrophobicity. For polymeric membranes, great hydrophobicity can be engineered using per-fluorinated polymers or phase immersion in a dual coagulation bath. Each technique has its advantages and weaknesses.

With increasing prevalence of NAFLD in both children and adults, an understanding of the factors that promote NAFLD development and progression is crucial. Environmental agents, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have been linked to other diseases, may play a role in NAFLD development. Increasing evidence supports a developmental origin of liver disease, and early-life exposure to EDCs could represent one risk factor for the development of NAFLD later in life. Rodent studies provide the strongest evidence for this link, but further studies are needed to define whether there is a causal link between early-life EDC exposure and NAFLD development in humans. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying development of NAFLD in the context of developmental EDC exposures may identify biomarkers for people at risk, as well as potential intervention and/or therapeutic opportunities for the disease.

Research over the last 10 years has shown that these compounds are ubiquitous environmental contaminants they are extremely persistent, show toxic effects and accumulate in the food chain. We evaluate global, temporal and spatial trends of these important emerging contaminants. Abstract This review gives an overview of existing knowledge of polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) in humans and in marine biota. Temporal trends and spatial distribution of PFCs were globally compared in humans, marine mammals, seabirds and fish. In general, PFC concentrations in the environment have increased significantly from the beginning of the production up to the 1990s. After the phase-out of perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) production starting in 2000, PFC concentrations in humans generally decreased. In marine biota no clear temporal trends were observed. The temporal trends depended on the species, their trophic levels and the geographical locations. PFC patterns in humans and in marine wildlife species were compared regarding perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), their shorter and longer chain homologues (C4C15) and precursor compounds. Finally knowledge gaps were identified and recommendations for future work were presented. © CSIRO 2010.",bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); fish; food chain; literature review; marine mammal; organic pollutant; polymer; public health; seabird; spatiotemporal analysis; toxicity test; trend analysis; trophic level; Mammalia

This article serves to review all the known antigens that have been shown to localize to subepithelial deposits in MN, as well as the distinctive characteristics associated with each subtype of MN. We will also shed light on the novel proteomic approaches that have allowed identification of the most recent antigens. The paradigm of an antigen normally expressed on the podocyte cell surface leading to in-situ immune complex formation, complement activation, and subsequent podocyte injury will be discussed and challenged in light of the current repertoire of multiple MN antigens. Since disease phenotypes associated with each individual target antigens can often blur the distinction between primary and secondary disease, we encourage the use of antigen-based classification of membranous nephropathy.

Applying a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) reduces waste generation from a cleaner process perspective and reduces energy consumption in line with the process intensification strategy. A CMR combines a chemical or biochemical reaction with a membrane separation process in a single unit by improving the performance of the process in terms of conversion and selectivity. The core of the CMR is the membrane which can be polymeric or inorganic depending on the operating conditions of the catalytic process. Besides, the membrane can be inert or catalytically active. The number of studies devoted to applying CMR with higher membrane area per unit volume in multi-phase reactions remains very limited for both catalytic polymeric and inorganic membranes. The various bio-based catalytic membrane system is also used in a different commercial application. The opportunities and advantages offered by applying catalytic membrane reactors to multi-phase systems need to be further explored. In this review, the preparation and the application of inorganic membrane reactors in the different catalytic processes as water gas shift (WGS), Fisher Tropsch synthesis (FTS), selective CO oxidation (CO SeLox), and so on, have been discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The incidence of thyroid cancer is thought to be rapidly and steadily increasing in recent decades. Recent studies have described thyroid cancer as the 4th most common cancer today, up from 14th in the early 1990s. This increase is mainly due to various environmental factors including: radiation, smoking, obesity, pollutants such as pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds, bromine flame retardants, perchlorates, nitrates and various elements such as metals, non-metals and metalloids. In particular, some metals such as iron, copper, cadmium, lead, vanadium, chromium, manganese and nickel have a positive effect, while others such as zinc and magnesium have a negative correlation with thyroid cancer. Other metals such as molybdenum, tin and cobalt appear to increase the incidence of thyroid cancer in combination, while sodium, mercury, aluminum and silver have no evidence of thyroid carcinogenicity. Of the non-metals, iodine and selenium deficiency are associated with carcinogenic effects on the thyroid, while there is no information on any phosphorus-relative activity. Boron belonging to the metalloids is considered a goitrogenic element and probably increases the incidence of thyroid cancer when it acts in combination with cadmium, molybdenum, taken in small non-toxic doses, for a long time. Finally, air pollution has been studied. It has been found that originating from gaseous waste is associated with an increased incidence of cancer in various anatomical areas, including the thyroid. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",aluminum; arsenic; boron; bromine; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; flame retardant; iodine; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; mercury; metalloid; molybdenum; nickel; nitric acid derivative; perchlorate; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; selenium; silver; sodium; tin; vanadium; xenobiotic agent; zinc; air pollution; cancer mortality; carcinogenicity; endocrine system; environmental factor; gas waste; human; incidence; ionizing radiation; obesity; pollutant; radiation; Review; smoking; thyroid cancer

They were identified as endocrine disruptors due to their ability to interfere with thyroid function. The resistance of PFOA and PFOS to environmental degradation, their bio-accumulation in food chains, and their long half-life raised concern in the scientific community, and several studies were performed with the aim to establish the real dangerousness of these compounds for the human health. Purpose: The present review will focus on the effects of PFOA and PFOS on the thyroid gland taking into account in vitro experiments, animal studies, and human data. PFOS and PFOA reduce the circulating levels of thyroid hormones in diet-exposed animals, mainly by increasing their metabolic clearance rate. Conclusions: An accumulation of PFOS and PFOA was documented in thyroid cells, and a cytotoxic effect was observed after exposure to extremely high concentrations of these compounds. In environmentally exposed communities and in the general population, the most consistent effect of exposure to PFOA, and to a less extent to PFOS, is the occurrence of hypothyroidism. Women and children appear to be more at risk of developing mild thyroid failure. Pregnant women with circulating thyroid antibodies might be at risk of developing subclinical hypothyroidism, mainly when exposed at high doses of PFOS. The relative risks for thyroid cancer in people exposed to PFOA and PFOS were low and based on a few cases. Moreover, there was no consistent finding across all or even most studies. © 2016, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).",endocrine disruptor; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; thyroid hormone; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; chemistry; environmental exposure; human; in vitro study; metabolic clearance rate; nonhuman; occupational exposure; pollution; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; Review; synthesis; thyroid cancer; thyroid function; thyroid gland; female; metabolism; Thyroid Diseases; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Pregnancy; Thyroid Diseases
NA,Human exposure pathways to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from indoor media: A systematic review,2022,NA,NA,"Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022",NA

Although microbiological contamination remains the largest cause of water-related morbidity and mortality globally, chemicals in water supplies may also cause disease, and evidence of the human health consequences is limited or lacking for many of them. Objectives: We aimed to summarize the state of knowledge, identify gaps in understanding, and provide recommendations for epidemiological research relating to chemicals occurring in drinking water. Discussion: Assessing exposure and the health consequences of chemicals in drinking water is challenging. Exposures are typically at low concentrations, measurements in water are frequently insufficient, chemicals are present in mixtures, exposure periods are usually long, multiple exposure routes may be involved, and valid biomarkers reflecting the relevant exposure period are scarce. In addition, the magnitude of the relative risks tends to be small. Conclusions: Research should include well-designed epidemiological studies covering regions with contrasting contaminant levels and sufficient sample size; comprehensive evaluation of contaminant occurrence in combination with bioassays integrating the effect of complex mixtures; sufficient numbers of measurements in water to evaluate geographical and temporal variability; detailed information on personal habits resulting in exposure (e.g., ingestion, showering, swimming, diet); collection of biological samples to measure relevant biomarkers; and advanced statistical models to estimate exposure and relative risks, considering methods to address measurement error. Last, the incorporation of molecular markers of early biological effects and genetic susceptibility is essential to understand the mechanisms of action. There is a particular knowledge gap and need to evaluate human exposure and the risks of a wide range of emerging contaminants.","arsenic; biological marker; disinfectant agent; drinking water; fluoride; manganese; nitrate; perfluorooctanoic acid; trihalomethane; bladder cancer; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; cyanobacterium; epigenetics; exposure; genomics; health; human; metabolomics; practice guideline; priority journal; proteomics; review; toxicity; transcriptomics; waste water; water contamination; water quality; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants, Chemical"

The full potential of the technique, however, is limited by the fact that growth of cells is usually restricted to a monolayer accompanied by major decreases in many of their tissue-specific functions. This has been shown to be due, in large part, to the inadequate oxygenation of cells growing in tissue culture dishes. Studies that show that the high charge density and rigidity of the plastic and glass surfaces used for culture are also major factors limiting growth of cells to a monolayer, are reviewed. A new culture system has been developed in which cells are grown on substrata made using perfluorocarbons (PFCs) coated with collagen type 1 and other adhesive factors. Perfluorocarbons have a much higher solubility for oxygen than water and have been used as oxygen delivery systems to protect cells from hypoxia. These new PFC-based substrata can provide both the optimal level of oxygen cells need to maintain differentiated functions and the flexible and weaker type of adhesion that allows cells to round up, interact with each other, and when provided with adequate nutritional support, to grow in three dimension.","1h,1h perfluoro 1 metadecanol; acetylcarnitine; adhesive agent; albumin; antioxidant; collagen type 1; cytochrome P450; decanol; epidermal growth factor; fibronectin; fluorocarbon; free radical; gelatin; growth factor; insulin; liothyronine; lipid; oxygen; perfluoro compound; perfluorotrihexylamine; politef; polyacrylamide gel; polystyrene; reactive oxygen metabolite; tyrosine; unclassified drug; water; aerobic metabolism; anchorage independent growth; biochemistry; biopsy; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell hypoxia; cell proliferation; cell respiration; cell strain HepG2; gas permeability; HeLa cell; liver cell; mammal cell; nonhuman; nutritional support; oxygen tension; oxygenation; physiology; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; review; solubility; spheroid cell; tissue culture; tissue specificity; Mammalia"

Optimized photochemical elimination methods, which involve the pollutant properties, light adsorption and quantum yield, interfacial interaction and environmental conditions, are promising techniques for controlling the potential risk of HOCs. The present review summarizes the mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) by photo-generated radical species (eg, hVB+, eCB-, ·OH, eaq-) on photocatalyst as well as the mechanisms of direct photolysis. The photochemical degradation of HOCs can be achieved through the electron transfer between HOCs and reactive radical species or photo-induced reduction from the excited state of HOCs. Optimazation designs of photocatalyst and reaction process are important factors for the photocatalytic degradation of HOCs. Based on the currently achieved research results, some key issuses for the future are proposed from some aspects such as the interfacial electron transfer, the information of band structure, and the integration of reaction and separation.",NA

The most common glucuronidation reactions are O- and N-glucuronidation and in this review, we discuss both, while the emphasis is on N-glucuronidation. Interspecies difference in glucuronidation is another central issue in this review due to its importance in drug development. Accordingly, the available data on glucuronidation in different animals comes mainly from the species that are used in preclinical studies to assess the safety of drugs under development. Both O- and N-glucuronidation reactions are chemically diverse. Different O-glucuronidation reactions are described and discussed, and many drugs that undergo such reactions are indicated. The compounds that undergo N-glucuronidation include primary aromatic amines, hydroxylamines, amides, tertiary aliphatic amines, and aromatic N-heterocycles. The interspecies variability in N-glucuronidation is particularly high, above all when it comes to aliphatic tertiary amines and aromatic N-heterocycles. The N-glucuronidation rates in humans are typically much higher than in animals, largely due to the activity of two enzymes, the extensively studied UGT1A4, and the more recently identified as a main player in N-glucuronidation, UGT2B10.

High concentrations of Tl that are primarily associated with the epithermal metallogenesis of sulfide minerals have the potential of producing Tl pollution in the environment, which has been recognized as an emerging pollutant in China. This paper aims to review the research progress in China on Tl pollution in terms of the source, mobility, transportation pathway, and health exposure of Tl and to address the environmental concerns on Tl pollution in a geo-environmental perspective. Tl associated with the epithermal metallogenesis of sulfide minerals has been documented to disperse readily and accumulate through the geo-environmental processes of soil enrichment, water transportation and food crop growth beyond a mineralized zone. The enrichments of Tl in local soil, water, and crops may result in Tl pollution and consequent adverse health effects, e.g. chronic Tl poisoning. Investigation of the baseline Tl in the geo-environment, proper land use and health-related environmental planning and regulation are critical to prevent the Tl pollution. Examination of the human urinary Tl concentration is a quick approach to identify exposure of Tl pollution to humans. The experiences of Tl pollution in China can provide important lessons for many other regions in the world with similar geo-environmental contexts because of the high mobility and toxicity of Tl. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Adverse health effects; China; Emerging pollutants; Environmental concerns; Environmental planning; Epithermal; Food crops; Geo-environment; Health impact; High concentration; High mobility; Human health; Metallogenesis; Mineralized zone; Quick approach; Research progress; Soil enrichment; Toxic metals; Water transportation; Crops; Health; Pollution; Sulfide minerals; Thallium; Soil pollution; sulfide; thallium; concentration (composition); health impact; metallogenesis; mobility; poisoning; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; soil pollution; sulfide; thallium; toxicity; water pollution; atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; China; crop production; environmental enrichment; environmental exposure; environmental planning; health hazard; human; pollution; priority journal; review; soil pollution; urinalysis; water transport; China; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; Sulfides; Thallium; China

However, they can be effectively removed by advanced treatment technologies such as sorption, membranes, and oxidation. Thus, it is essential to understand the removal mechanisms of various PFASs during these advanced treatment processes, in particular because the physicochemical characteristics of various PFASs impose difficult challenges regarding determining the transport and fate of these compounds in aqueous solution.

In this review, toxicokinetic data of PFCAs (chain lengths ranging from 4 to 10) in different species are compared with an emphasis on their relevance to renal elimination. PFCAs vary in their affinities to bind to serum albumins in plasma, which is an important factor in determining the renal clearance of PFCAs. PFCA-albumin binding has been well characterized and is summarized in this review. The mechanism of the sex-, species-, and chain length-dependent renal PFCA elimination is a research area that has gained continuous interest since the beginning of toxicological studies of PFCAs. It is now recognized that organic anion transport proteins play a key role in PFCA renal tubular reabsorption, a process that is sex-, species-, and chain length-dependent. Recent studies on the identification of PFCA renal transport proteins and characterization of their transport kinetics have greatly improved our understanding of the PFCA renal transport mechanism at the molecular level. A mathematical representation of this renal tubular reabsorption mechanism has been incorporated in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). Improvement of PBPK models in the future will require more accurate and quantitative characterization of renal transport pathways of PFCAs. To that end, a basolateral membrane efflux pathway for the reabsorption of PFCAs in the kidney is discussed in this review, which could provide a future research direction toward a better understanding of the mechanisms of PFCA renal elimination. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","haloacid; perfluorocarboxylic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; serum albumin; unclassified drug; binding affinity; drug elimination; drug protein binding; human; kidney clearance; kidney tubule absorption; nonhuman; review; sex difference; species comparison; toxicokinetics; Animals; Carboxylic Acids; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Kidney; Models, Biological; Octanoic Acids; Mammalia"

Though landfill cover (LFC) (viz., daily, intermittent and final cover) is widely used by landfill operators to mitigate or reduce these emissions, their overall performance is still under question. A critical analysis of available literature, primarily pertaining to (i) the composition of the landfill gases and their migration in the LFC system, (ii) experimental and mathematical investigations of the transport mechanism of gas and (iii) the impact of additives to cover soils on transport and fate of gas, has been conducted and presented in this manuscript. Investigation of the efficiency of modified soil was mainly focused on laboratory test. More field tests and application of amended cover soils should be conducted and promoted further. Studies on nitrous oxide and emerging pollutants, including poly-fluoroalkyl substances transport in landfill cover system are limited and need further research. The transport mechanisms of these unconventional contaminants should be considered regarding the selection of LFC materials including geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liners. The existing analytical and numerical models can provide a basic understanding of LFG transport mechanisms and are able to predict the migration behaviour of LFG; however, there are still knowledge gaps concerning the interaction between different species of the gas molecule when modeling multi-component gas transport. Gas transport through fractured cover should also be considered when evaluating LFG emission in the future. Simplified design method for landfill cover system regarding LFG emission based on analytical models should be proposed. Overall, mathematical models combined with experiments can facilitate more visualized and intensive insights, which would be instrumental in devising climate adaptive landfill covers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",nitrous oxide; perfluoroalkanoic acid; volatile organic compound; chemical pollutant; experimental study; geomembrane; landfill; porous medium; adsorption; advection; degradation; diffusion; diffusion flux; gas; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas emission; laboratory test; landfill; mathematical model; methane emission; municipal solid waste; nitrous oxide emission; oxidation; pollution transport; Review; soil layer; soil pollution; surface property; gas; human; procedures; soil; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Gases; Humans; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Waste Disposal Facilities

The properties that characterize are their low degradability as well as their resistance to water, oil and heat. This results in their high persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in different organisms, causing many adverse effects on the environment as well as in human health. Some of their effects remain unknown to this day. As there are thousands of registered PFAS, it is difficult to apply traditional technologies for an efficient removal and detection for all. This has made it difficult for wastewater treatment plants to remove or degrade PFAS before discharging the effluents into the environment. Also, monitoring these contaminants depends mostly on chromatography-based methods, which require expensive equipment and consumables, making it difficult to detect PFAS in the environment. The detection of PFAS in the environment, and the development of technologies to be implemented in tertiary treatment of wastewater treatment plants are topics of high concern. This study focuses on analyzing and discussing the mechanisms of occurrence, migration, transformation, and fate of PFAS in the environment, as well the main adverse effects in the environment and human health. The following work reviews the recent advances in the development of PFAS detection technologies (biosensors, electrochemical sensors, microfluidic devices), and removal/degradation methods (electrochemical degradation, enzymatic transformation, advanced oxidation, photocatalytic degradation). Understanding the risks to public health and identifying the routes of production, transportation, exposure to PFAS is extremely important to implement regulations for the detection and removal of PFAS in wastewater and the environment.

The dysfunction appears to be triggered within 2.5 min of the endothelial generation of a large burst of superoxide radicals (40, 76, 117). However, the initial dysfunction may be amplified by neutrophil-generated factors including oxygen-derived free radicals, cytokines, proteases, and lipid mediators. Moreover, adhesive molecules on the surface of the PMN, along with their ligands on the endothelial cell membrane, appear to promote endothelial dysfunction in ways that may go beyond the adherence of neutrophils on the endothelial surface. These interactions remain to be elucidated but may involve intricate cell signaling pathways. A variety of pharmacologic agents exert endothelial protective effects in ischemia-reperfusion and circulatory shock states. Table 1 summarizes these agents and indicates the major mechanism of preservation of the endothelium. These substances can be classified into three broad categories: (a) substances replacing endogenous cytoprotective agents of endothelial origin including prostacyclin (PGI2), endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), and adenosine: the endothelium protecting agents include these substances as well as stable analogs of PGI2, and nitric oxide donors; (b) substances that inhibit pro-inflammatory mediators of endothelial origin: the pro-inflammatory agents are primarily platelet activating factor (PAF) and oxygen-derived free radicals (e.g. superoxide radicals) although other mediators may be involved. The therapeutic agents useful in this area are PAF receptor antagonists and free radical scavengers (e.g. superoxide dismutase); (c) substances that inhibit neutrophils or neutrophil-derived mediators: the major neutrophil-derived mediators are oxygen-derived free radicals, cytokines (e.g. TNFα and IL-1β), proteases (e.g. elastase), and lipid mediators (e.g. LTB4). In addition, adhesive molecules on the neutrophil surface and their endothelial ligands promote endothelial dysfunction and the action of adherent neutrophils. Agents that inhibit some of these mediators are transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), elastase inhibitors, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor antagonists and monoclonal antibodies to adhesive proteins (e.g. anti-CD18, anti-ICAM-1). Further work is needed to clarify these findings and to determine the physiolsogic and pathophysiologic interactions among these diverse agents. This topic of endothelial dysfunction represents a fertile area for further investigation to elucidate the complex mechanisms of neutrophil-endothelial interactions. These interactions lead to neutrophil adherence to the endothelium, neutrophil migration into the underlying tissues, and subsequent tissue injury (e.g. myocardial reperfusion injury). Understanding these mechanisms will provide important insight into the pathophysiologic proceses of reperfusion injury as well as offer important targets for therapeutic intervention in these important disease states.",acetylcholine; adenosine; antibody; cardiovascular agent; CD18 antigen; cytokine; defibrotide; free radical; glyceryl trinitrate; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; lipoxygenase inhibitor; nitric oxide; perfluoro compound; prostacyclin; proteinase; sodium nitrite; superoxide; superoxide dismutase; taprostene; thrombocyte activating factor antagonist; thromboxane synthase inhibitor; transforming growth factor beta; cell protection; ischemia; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; reperfusion injury; review; shock; vascular endothelium; Lethrinidae

As it is not known why the strictly controlled C system starts to react against autologous heart tissue, we have analyzed the expression of various membrane regulators of C (CR1, DAF, MCP, CD59, C8 binding protein) and the pattern of deposition of C components and plasma C regulators (C4b binding protein and vitronectin) in normal (n = 7) and infarcted (n = 13) human myocardium. In the infarcted myocardium deposits of the C membrane attack complex (MAC) were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and lesions resembling the transmembrane channels of MAC were detected by transmission electron microscopy. CD59 and C8 binding protein were strongly expressed by muscle cells of normal myocardial tissue. Little or no CR1, MCP, and DAF was observed on these cells. The assembly of MAC was accompanied by the deposition of vitronectin (S-protein) and C4b binding protein in the infarcted areas of myocardium. In accordance with our earlier results the expression of CD59 but not of C8 binding protein was clearly diminished in the lesions. The results show that C8 binding protein, vitronectin, and C4b binding protein do not prevent complement attack against the infarcted myocardium but rather become codeposited with the MAC. Ischemia-induced transformation of nonviable cells into complement activators, acquired loss of resistance to the MAC by shedding of CD59, and recruitment of multifunctional serum proteins by MAC could thus constitute a general process aimed at the clearance of injured tissue.","binding protein; cd59 antigen; complement component c4b; complement membrane attack complex; regulator protein; vitronectin; antigen expression; cell transformation; complement activation; complex formation; heart infarction; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunohistochemistry; membrane channel; priority journal; review; transmission electron microscopy; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Complement C4; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Glycoproteins; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Immunohistochemistry; Macrophage Activation; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Sarcolemma; Time Factors; Vitronectin"

Therefore, it is important to use mixed microbial cultures and their interactions with the microbiome in the targeted ecosystem to perform robust functions towards their sustainability in harsh environmental conditions. Emerging pollutants like phthalates and hydrocarbons that are toxic to several aquatic and terrestrial life forms in the water bodies and lands are an alarming situation. The present review explores the possibility of devising an inclusive eco-friendly strategy like microbiome engineering which proves to be a unique and crucial technology involving the power of microbial communication through quorum sensing. This review discusses the interspecies and intra-species communications between different microbial groups with their respective environments. Moreover, this review also envisages the efforts for designing the next level of microbiome-host engineering concept (MHEC). The focus of the review also extended toward using omics and metabolic network analysis-based tools for effective microbiome engineering. These approaches might be quite helpful in the future to understand such microbial interactions but it will be challenging to implement in the real environment to get the desired functions. Finally, the review also discusses multiple approaches for the bioremediation of toxic chemicals from the soil environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Biotechnology; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Emerging pollutants; Engineering concepts; Environmental conditions; Microbiome; Microbiome engineering; Microbiome-host engineering concept; Mixed microbial culture; Open environment; Syncom; Bioremediation

Hydrocarbons can be produced from alternative carbonaceous resources (natural gas, coal, biomass and waste) through FTS and the use of biomass is particularly attractive from a carbon footprint point of view. However, the nature of biomass resources dictates a different exploration approach compared to fossil fuel resources. Compared to coal and natural gas based FTS processes where economics of scale is an advantage, a Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) plant is more suited for smaller scale operation. Thus, the BTL process economy will benefit from a condensed FTS processes. Moreover, considering the expected role of FTS in regional and global hydrocarbon supply in the near future, it becomes pertinent to strive towards improving the process economy. This requires molecular and process engineering and detailed knowledge of the reaction is a pre-requisite to engineering the reaction at molecular level. Syngas to hydrocarbon involves consecutive steps of CO activation, C-C coupling, hydrogenation and desorption of the hydrocarbon product. Atomic details of the dynamics of these steps are still unclear. Recently, clearer pictures about activation are now available. However, over the course of ninety years since the first report on an FTS, proposed pathway of C-C coupling has come full cycle from oxygenate to nonoxygenate and back to oxygenate intermediates. To this end, we attempted an X-ray of progress made at providing answers to issues in the chemistry of FTS. The review focuses on product distribution, macro kinetics and the mechanism of FTS. We compare FTS with other C-C coupling reactions of CO, identify catalytic entities for controlling product selectivity and finally we offer an outlook on future directions of fundamental research towards resolving the lingering questions on the mechanism of C-C coupling in FTS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",Biomass; Carbon footprint; Chemical bonds; Desorption; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Synthesis gas; Biomass resources; C-C coupling; C-C coupling reactions; CO activation; Economics of scale; Fossil fuel resources; Fundamental research; Hydrocarbon product; Liquid hydrocarbons; Macro kinetics; Molecular levels; Natural gas based; Product distributions; Product selectivities; Syn-gas; Coal deposits

We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I2: 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I2: 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses.

The structure-property relationship of SPI membranes is discussed in details with respect to the chemical structure of various sulfonated diamines and morphology of SPI membranes from the viewpoints of viscosity, mechanical strength and proton conductivity. Ion exchange capacity (IEC), basicity of sulfonated diamine, configuration (para-, meta-, or ortho-orientation) and chemical structure of polymer chain (linear or net-work) show great influence on the water stability and mechanical strength of SPI membrane. The SPIs with a branched/crosslinked structure and derived from highly basic sulfonated diamines display reasonably high water stability of more than 200-300 h in water at 130°C, suggesting high potential as PEMs operating at temperatures up to 100°C. The SPI membranes have fairly high proton conductivity at higher relative humidities and low methanol permeability. The water and methanol crossover through membrane under the fuel cell operation conditions is not controlled by electro-osmosis due to proton transport but by diffusion due to activity difference. This is quite different from the case of perfluorosulfonated membranes such as Nafion and results in the advantageous effects on fuel cell performance. SPI membranes displayed high PEFC performances comparable to those of Nafion 112. In addition, SPI membranes displayed higher performances in DMFC systems with higher methanol concentration (20-50 wt%). which is superior to Nafion and have high potential for DMFC applications at mediate temperatures (40-80°C).",Branching; Fuel Cell Performance; Hydrolysis Stability; Polymer Electrolyte Membrane; Proton Conductivity; Sulfonated Diamine; Sulfonated Polyimide; Water Stability; Electric conductivity; Fuel cells; Naphthalene; Polyimides; Protons; Polymeric membranes

This barrier between the body and the environment is constantly maintained by reproduction of inner living epidermal keratinocytes which undergo a process of terminal differentiation and then migrate to the surface as interlocking layers of dead stratum corneum cells. These cells provide the bulwark of mechanical and chemical protection, and together with their intercellular lipid surroundings, confer water-impermeability. Much of this barrier function is provided by the cornified cell envelope (CE), an extremely tough protein/lipid polymer structure formed just below the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequently resides on the exterior of the dead cornified cells. It consists of two parts: a protein envelope and a lipid envelope. The protein envelope is thought to contribute to the biomechanical properties of the CE as a result of cross-linking of specialized CE structural proteins by both disulfide bonds and N(ε)-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds formed by transglutaminases. Some of the structural proteins involved include involucrin, loricrin, small proline rich proteins, keratin intermediate filaments, elafin, cystatin A, and desmosomal proteins. The lipid envelope is located on the exterior of and covalently attached by ester bonds to the protein envelope and consists of a monomolecular layer of ω-hydroxyceramides. These not only serve of provide a Teflon-like coating to the cell, but also interdigitate with the intercellular lipid lamellae perhaps in a Velcro-like fashion. In fact the CE is a common feature of all stratified squamous epithelia, although its precise composition, structure and barrier function requirements vary widely between epithelia. Recent work has shown that a number of diseases which display defective epidermal barrier function, generically known as ichthyoses, are the result of genetic defects of the synthesis of either CE proteins, the transglutaminase 1 cross-linking enzyme, or defective metabolism of skin lipids.",ceramide derivative; cystatin; elafin; involucrin; keratin; lipid; loricrin; proline; protein; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase; structural protein; cell differentiation; cell membrane; cell migration; disulfide bond; epidermis; epidermis cell; intermediate filament; keratinocyte; mammal; nonhuman; review; skin permeability; squamous epithelium; stratum corneum; water loss; Mammalia

This comparative assessment indicates that [i] PFPAs likely have high persistence and long-range transport potential; [ii] PFPiAs may transform to PFPAs (and possibly PFCAs) in the environment and biota [iii] certain PFPAs and PFPiAs can only be slowly eliminated from rainbow trout and rats, similarly to long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs; [iv] PFPAs and PFPiAs have modes-of-action that are both similar to, and different from, those of PFCAs and PFSAs; and [v] the measured levels of PFPAs/PFPiAs in the global environment and biota appear to be low in comparison to PFCAs and PFSAs, suggesting, for the time being, low risks from PFPAs and PFPiAs alone. Although risks from individual PFPAs/PFPiAs are currently low, their ongoing production and use and high persistence will lead to increasing exposure and risks over time. Furthermore, simultaneous exposure to PFPAs, PFPiAs and other PFASs may result in additive effects necessitating cumulative risk assessments. To facilitate effective future research, we highlight possible strategies to overcome sampling and analytical challenges. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Consumer products; Hazards; Life cycle; Risk assessment; Transportation routes; Analytical challenge; Environmental fate; Environmental occurrence; Exposure routes; PBT assessment; PFPAs and PFPiAs; Chemical resistance; chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl phosphonic; phosphinic acid; unclassified drug; dangerous goods; fluorocarbon; phosphinic acid derivative; phosphonic acid derivative; phosphorous acid; pollutant; air exposure; comparative study; environmental fate; environmental hazard; life cycle analysis; pesticide; risk assessment; sampling; bioccumulation potential; chemical analysis; chemical phenomena; comparative study; concentration (parameters); ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental hazard; environmental monitoring; hazard; hazard assessment; human; long range transport potential; measurement; nonhuman; persistance; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; analysis; animal; dangerous goods; ecotoxicology; environmental monitoring; methodology; pharmacokinetics; pollutant; procedures; toxicity; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Rattus; Animals; Ecotoxicology; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Phosphinic Acids; Phosphorous Acids; Research Design; Risk Assessment

The Baltic Sea is particularly susceptible to pollution by hazardous substances (limited water exchange, shallowness, and large catchment area). Polish media regularly reports ecological catastrophes in the Gulf of Gdańsk area caused by eg. shipwrecks leaking. Thus, there is a need of a broad scientific based report on recent contaminant loads and distribution. In this review paper, we report loads of contaminants from different obvious and non-obvious sources. We also gather data on legacy and new emerging contaminant concentrations measured in the Gulf of Gdańsk within the last decade (2008–2018).

Whether these changes are related to the mechanical or to the chemical properties of PFCL is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pressure spikes or shearing forces during endotamponade with PFCL and standardised eye movements. Material and Methods: Part 1: In an eye model the resulting pressure forces of 6 PFCL were measured at four different sites during standardised eye movements. Part 2: Shearing forces were determined in a plexiglass eye model and the resulting tangential forces at the PFCL-retina interface were calculated. Part 3: Rabbit eyes were vitrectomised and filled with light and heavy fluorocarbons for 6 weeks. Subsequently, the retina were examined histologically and by immunohistochemistry. Results: With increasing filling of the eye model, the maximum of the pressure peaks moved from the inferior wall of the eye model to the lateral eye walls. For perfluorodecalin (PFD) the highest pressure peak was 407 Pa with a 75 % filling of the vitreous cavity. The lowest pressure peak was 314 Pa with a 50 % filling of hexafluoropropene oxide. Shearing forces for standardised accelerations were dependent on viscosity and ranged between 0.87 mN/m2 (perfluorohexyloctane) and 8055 mN/m2 (hexafluoropropene oxide). Part 3: Histological and immunohistochemical analyses did not reveal pressure-related damage or any difference between the effects of the different tamponades in vivo. Conclusion: In comparison with physiological dynamic and static pressure peaks, the measured mechanical forces induced by intraocular PFCL tamponades are low. Specific gravity and mechanical damage by intraocular PFCL as a cause of retinal damage seem unlikely. Animal studies underline these findings. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","fluorocarbon; perfluorodecalin; perfluorohexyloctane; fluorocarbon; calculation; eye movement; gravity; histology; human; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; intraocular pressure; liquid; rabbit; retina injury; review; spike; viscosity; vitrectomy; animal; biological model; drug effect; pathophysiology; retina; shear strength; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Gravitation; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Models, Biological; Retina; Shear Strength"

Unlike their brethren, the SURs have no identified transport function; instead, evolution has matched these molecules with K+ selective pores, either K IR6.1/KCNJ8 or KIR6.2/KCNJ11, to assemble adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels found in endocrine cells, neurons, and both smooth and striated muscle. Adenine nucleotides, the major regulators of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel activity, exert a dual action. Nucleotide binding to the pore reduces the activity or channel open probability, whereas Mg-nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domains of SUR antagonize this inhibitory action to stimulate channel openings. Mutations in either subunit can alter this balance and, in the case of the SUR1/KIR6.2 channels found in neurons and insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells, are the cause of monogenic forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and neonatal diabetes. Additionally, the subtle dysregulation of KATP channel activity by a KIR6.2 polymorphism has been suggested as a predisposing factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies on KATP channel null mice are clarifying the roles of these metabolically sensitive channels in a variety of tissues. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","ABC transporter; ABC transporter C8; ABC transporter C9; acetylcholine; adenosine diphosphate; adenosine triphosphate; catecholamine; diazoxide; glibenclamide; glimepiride; glipizide; glucose; incretin; insulin; inwardly rectifying potassium channel; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.1; inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2; magnesium; nateglinide; octreotide; oral antidiabetic agent; potassium channel; repaglinide; sulfonylurea; sulfonylurea receptor; sulfonylurea receptor 1; sulfonylurea receptor 2; tolbutamide; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; brain; channel gating; diabetes mellitus; drug binding site; drug mechanism; drug substitution; endocrine cell; gene mutation; genetic polymorphism; gluconeogenesis; homeostasis; human; hyperinsulinemia; hypoglycemia; insulin release; insulin treatment; liver; liver function; molecular evolution; nerve cell; newborn disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; potassium channelopathy; priority journal; protein assembly; protein binding; protein domain; protein function; protein hydrolysis; regulatory mechanism; review; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; smooth muscle; transgenic mouse; upregulation; Amino Acids; Animals; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Calcium; Catecholamines; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Models, Animal; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucose; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Insulin; Liver; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Models, Molecular; Persistent Hyperinsulinemia Hypoglycemia of Infancy; Potassium Channels; Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptors, Drug"

Evaluations of different configurations of the organic denuder, and SVOC determined by different denuder-based samplers, both integrated and semi-continuous, are reviewed. A new equation for determination of the denuder efficiency is estimated, considering the efficiency of removing both the gaseous organics that could be adsorbed by the quartz and the gaseous passing through the quartz that could be subsequently adsorbed by the backup adsorbent filter. The origin of OC on the backup quartz filter, behind either quartz or Teflon filter, is quantitatively evaluated by the denuder-based method based on the data published.

The cause of disease pathology is an expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats within the huntingtin gene (HTT) on chromosome 4 (4p16.3), which codes the huntingtin protein (mHTT). The common symptoms of HD include motor and cognitive impairment of psychiatric functions. Patients exhibit a representative phenotype of involuntary movement (chorea) of limbs, impaired cognition, and severe psychiatric disturbances (mood swings, depression, and personality changes). A variety of symptomatic treatments (which target glutamate and dopamine pathways, caspases, inhibition of aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional dysregulation, and fetal neural transplants, etc.) are available and some are in the pipeline. Advancement in novel therapeutic approaches include targeting the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein and the HTT gene. New gene editing techniques will reduce the CAG repeats. More appropriate and readily tractable treatment goals, coupled with advances in analytical tools will help to assess the clinical outcomes of HD treatments. This will not only improve the quality of life and life span of HD patients, but it will also provide a beneficial role in other inherited and neurological disorders.

While indirect additives can be found in traces in food and come from materials used for packaging, storage, and technological processing of food, direct additives are added to food with a special purpose (canning). The use of additives is justified if it is in accordance with legal regulations and does not pose a health or danger to consumers in the prescribed concentration. However, due to the specificity of the child’s metabolic system, there is a greater risk that the negative effects of the additive will manifest. Considering the importance of the potential negative impact of additives on children’s health and the increased interest in the control and monitoring of additives in food for children, we have reviewed the latest available literature available through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Expert data were taken from publicly available documents published from January 2010 to April 2022 by internationally recognized professional organizations. It was found that the most frequently present additives in the food consumed by children are bisphenols, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl chemicals, perchlorates, pesticides, nitrates and nitrites, artificial food colors, monosodium glutamate, and aspartame. Increasing literacy about the presence and potential risk through continuous education of parents and young people as well as active monitoring of newly registered additives and harmonization of existing legal regulations by competent authorities can significantly prevent the unwanted effects of additives on children’s health. © 2022 by the authors.",aspartame; fluorine derivative; food additive; food dye; glutamate sodium; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; perchlorate; perfluoroalkyl; pesticide; phenol derivative; phthalic acid derivative; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; food additive; pesticide; additive; child care; nitrate; nitrite; nutritional status; public health; child; child health; child nutrition; data base; food intake; health education; health literacy; human; legal aspect; Review; adolescent; Adolescent; Aspartame; Child; Fluorocarbons; Food Additives; Humans; Nitrites; Perchlorates; Pesticides; Sodium Glutamate

A key property in many of these applications is surface energy; specifically a low surface energy is often desired so as to impart low adhesive behavior to the materials. The fluorine–carbon bond displays low polarizability, and so fluorocarbons show high resistance to interactions with both polar and non-polar molecules. Thus the commodity fluoropolymers within the PFTE family have been used widely in applications where low adhesion and solvent resistance are important. For several decades scientists have included perfluorinated or partly-fluorinated segments into specialty polymers in attempts to achieve low fouling behavior, and modification of virtually every class of macromolecule has been explored. Notably, over the past several decades, advances in polymerization techniques, specifically controlled radical polymerization, have made possible the creation of polymers with highly-specific and unique structures, for example, block and well-defined network copolymers. Accordingly, this review discusses traditional partly-fluorinated materials but primarily focuses on recent progress in the design of partly-fluorinated polymeric materials with low surface energy. The objective of the review is to provide a concise summary of the approaches taken to date, and to demonstrate, though example, areas with high potential for innovation in the future. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Adhesives; Biomaterials; Block copolymers; Interfacial energy; Polymerization; Surface segregation; Controlled radical polymerization; Fluorinated materials; Low surface energy; Modern technologies; Nonpolar molecules; Partly fluorinated polymers; Solvent resistance; Specialty polymers; Fluorine containing polymers

In the 1960s and 1970s, when medical technology and blood use were expanding rapidly and liquid whole blood and RBC storage were limited to 3 weeks, many attempts were made to expand the use of frozen RBC for meeting the needs for a stable blood supply and to have RBC reserves for emergencies. These attempts have largely been abandoned because of the cost of freezing, storing and processing, better management of the larger and longer lived RBC inventory, concerns about the safety of stored RBC that have not received the most up-to-date testing and the losses associated with the short shelf life of thawed RBC. New automated frozen RBC processing systems will potentially allow extending the outdate of thawed RBC to 2 weeks, but will not materially effect the costs or losses associated with the use of frozen RBC.

However, to ensure sufficient sensitivity of 19 F MRI, fluorine probes with a high content of chemically equivalent fluorine atoms are required. The majority of 19 F MRI agents are perfluorocarbon emulsions, which have a broad range of applications in molecular imaging, although the content of fluorine atoms in these molecules is limited. In this review, we focus mainly on polymer probes that allow higher fluorine content and represent versatile platforms with properties tailorable to a plethora of biomedical in vivo applications. We discuss the chemical development, up to the first imaging applications, of these promising fluorine probes, including injectable polymers that form depots that are intended for possible use in cancer therapy. © 2018, The Author(s).","contrast medium; fluorine; fluorocarbon; polymer; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal; chemistry; devices; fluorine magnetic resonance imaging; human; light; metabolism; molecular imaging; molecular probe; mouse; pH; procedures; radiation scattering; temperature; trends; Animals; Contrast Media; Fluorine; Fluorine-19 Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Light; Mice; Molecular Imaging; Molecular Probes; Polymers; Reactive Oxygen Species; Scattering, Radiation; Temperature"

Recent studies have shown higher concentrations of these contaminants in serum of hyperthyroid cats in comparison to cats with normal thyroid status.

The molecular weight of polymer additives plays a critical role in modulating the crystal growth, enabling phase segregation, optimizing thin film morphology, and improving the charge transport of organic semiconductors. Here, we provide an in-depth review of the recent progress in studying amorphous and semicrystalline polymeric additives, including polystyrene, poly(α-methylstyrene), polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene oxide, and fully discuss the effect of the different polymer molecular weights on semiconductor crystallization, active layer composition, and the electrical performance of miscellaneous organic semiconductors.

Appropriate animal model selection is required to effectively recapitulate the human experience, including relevant dosing and windows of exposure, and ensure translational utility and reproducibility. While classical toxicology heavily relies on inbred rats and mice, and focuses on apical endpoints such as tumor formation or birth defects, EDC researchers have used a greater diversity of species to effectively model more subtle but significant outcomes such as changes in pubertal timing, mammary gland development, and social behaviors.

Many countries have investigated and tried to implement various countermea-sures in response to this decision. In this article, we collect reports concerning regulations and risk evaluations of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and review the current PFC management practiced in various countries. The first part of this review contains a comprehensive collection of proposed standard PFC values, including provisional tolerable daily intakes (pTDI), drinking water guidelines, and predicted non-effect concentrations (PNEC). The pTDI values ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 μg/kg/day for PFOS, and there are wide margins of safety for adults. Health risks for plant workers exposed to PFCs and for infants are of particular concern. The application of these proposed values in controlling PFC pollution is one approach that may effectively control human health risk without unduly sacrificing the benefits from PFC use. The second part of this review contains a collection and review of a number of regulations and countermeasures, such as an EU directive, regulation in Canada, and the Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), including voluntary control (i.e., production phase-out by 3M, stewardship programs, regulation in the semiconductor industry). Most of these regulations are based principally on the precautionary principle. However, they may not be as effective in pollution reduction as intended because the chemicals in question are already widely distributed in the environment owing to their use and mobility in the environment. In addition, these types of regulations would be non-operative in developing countries because rapidly growing economies place great demand on high performance materials, including PFCs. Further development of risk assessment methods that allow the evaluation of the counter risks of PFC alternatives and the loss of benefits from the PFC ban is necessary because of the possible continuous use of PFCs, especially in developing countries. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Developing countries; Health risks; Management; Organic chemicals; Organic pollutants; Pollution control; Potable water; Semiconductor device manufacture; Guideline; High performance material; Perfluorinated compound (PFCs); Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Persistent organic pollutants; Regulation; Risk assessment and managements; Significant new use rules; Risk assessment

Reclaiming and reusing the solvents may be the most economically and environmentally beneficial option for managing spent solvents. Purifying the solvents to meet reuse specifications can be challenging. For hydrophilic solvents, water must be removed prior to reuse, yet many hydrophilic solvents form hard-to-separate azeotropic mixtures with water. Such mixtures make separation processes energy-intensive and cause economic challenges. The membrane processes pervaporation (PV) and vapor permeation (VP) can be less energy-intensive than distillation-based processes and have proven to be very effective in removing water from azeotropic mixtures. In PV/VP, separation is based on the solution–diffusion interaction between the dense permselective layer of the membrane and the solvent/water mixture. This review provides a state-of-the-science analysis of materials used as the selective layer(s) of PV/VP membranes in removing water from organic solvents. A variety of membrane materials, such as polymeric, inorganic, mixed matrix, and hybrid, have been reported in the literature. A small subset of these is commercially available and highlighted here: poly (vinyl alcohol), polyimides, amorphous perfluoro polymers, NaA zeolites, chabazite zeolites, T-type zeolites, and hybrid silicas. The typical performance characteristics and operating limits of these membranes are discussed. Solvents targeted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for reclamation are emphasized and ten common solvents are chosen for analysis: acetonitrile, 1-butanol, N,N-dimethyl formamide, ethanol, methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and 2-propanol.

Initiation requires ATP-bound DnaA protein, together with replication proteins. Replication is followed by decatenation and monomerization of sister-chromosome molecules. Sister chromosomes are rapidly partitioned into opposite halves of the cell, perhaps by a kinesin-like protein (MukB). Cytokinesis starts with the formation of a ring of a CTP-binding protein (FtsZ), usually around the cell center. A specific enzyme (PBP3) and other proteins (FtsQ, FtsA, FtsL, FtsW) are responsible for the coordinate ingrowth of the peptidoglycan cell wall at this location. EnvA protein is required to split the resultant cross-wall to form new cell poles. The formation of the FtsZ ring is inhibited by activated MinC protein, but the MinE protein reverses this inhibition at potential division sites. A minimum cell length is probably required for partition and a minimum-size DNA-free zone for septum formation.",cell cycle; cell division; DNA replication; Escherichia coli; nonhuman; priority journal; review; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli

The etiology of MRKH syndrome is complex and largely unexplained. Familial clustering suggests a genetic component and the spectrum of clinical presentations seems consistent with an inheritance pattern characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Mutations of several candidate genes have been proposed as possible causes based on genetic analyses of human patients and animal models. In addition, studies of monozygotic twins with discordant phenotypes suggest a role for epigenetic changes following potential exposure to environmental compounds. The spectrum of clinical presentations is consistent with intricate disruptions of shared developmental pathways or signals during early organogenesis. However, the lack of functional validation and translational studies have limited our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this condition. The clinical management of affected women, including early diagnosis, genetic testing of MRKH syndrome, and the implementation of counseling strategies, is significantly impeded by these knowledge gaps. Here, we illustrate the embryonic development of tissues and organs affected by MRKH syndrome, highlighting key pathways that could be involved in its pathogenesis.

We propose that prenatal exposure to mixtures of thyroid hormone– disrupting chemicals provides a plausible biological mechanism contributing to current increases in the incidence of neurodevelopmental disease and IQ loss. © 2018 The authors.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; bisphenol F; bisphenol S; chlorphenotane; chlorpyrifos; cigarette smoke; endocrine disruptor; estrogen related receptor; flavonoid; hexachlorobenzene; mancozeb; maneb; messenger RNA; perchlorate; perfluorinated chemical; phthalic acid; polybrominated flame retardant; polychlorinated biphenyl; silicristin; silybilin; silymarin; thiocyanate; thyroid disrupting chemical; thyroid hormone receptor; thyromimetic agent; thyrotropin; triclosan; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; zineb; ziram; attention deficit disorder; brain development; concentration (parameters); human; innate immunity; intelligence quotient; metabolism; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; protein expression; Review; thyroid disease"

More recently, the retinoid X receptors (RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the estrogen related receptor γ (ERRγ) have also been identified as targets of EDCs. Finally, nuclear receptors still poorly studied for their interaction with environmental ligands such as the progesterone receptor (PR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the retinoic acid receptors (RAR α, RARβ and RARγ), the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the liver X receptors α and β (LXRα and LXβ) as well are suspected targets of EDCs. Humans are generally exposed to low doses of pollutants, therefore the aim of current research is to identify the targets of EDCs at environmental concentrations.

Research on PBDEs has been extensively conducted in e-waste dumping sites in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, where the PBDE levels in the environmental matrices and human bodies are relatively high. PFOS/PFOA levels are relatively low in environmental matrices and human bodies in China, perhaps because of the lower usage in China compared with North America. The recent studies have indicated the widespread occurrence of PBDEs and perfluorinated compounds in China. Usually, PBDE-209 is the predominant component of PBDEs, and PFOS is the major perfluorinated compounds in environmental samples. Until now, there have been few studies on Dechlorane Plus and short-chain chlorinated paraffin pollution reported in China. Few data are available to understand the long-term temporal variations of the environmental levels of such emerging POPs. More work should be done to strengthen local monitoring capacity for emerging POPs in China to further investigate their pollution status.

Zinc porphyrin dye sensitizer YD2-o-C8 has become a research hotspot due to its high molar absorption coefficient and environmental friendliness. However, YD2-o-C8 and its derivatives still have some shortcomings in the application: (1) the carboxyl anchoring group is easy to desorb, which makes the dye unstable; (2) the low absorption intensity of dye sensitizer in the near-infrared region reduces the photoelectric conversion performance, which limits its large-scale production and application; (3) the easily self-polymerized dye sensitizer can shorten the service life and reduce the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. In recent years, based on zinc porphyrin dye sensitizer YD2-o-C8, many derivative porphyrin dye sensitizers with D-π-A structure have been synthesized by changing the structure of electron donor, electron acceptor and conjugated π-bridge. Dye sensitizers such as WW-6 and NCH3-YD2 appeared by changing the electron donor group. Dye sensitizers such as YD2-II-CA and PorCND1A1 appeared by changing the conjugate π-bridge. Dye sensitizers such as YD2-o-C8T and MH1 are produced by changing the electron-acceptor and anchoring group. These dye sensitizers expand the absorption range of B band and Q band, improve the absorption intensity of near-infrared region, and then improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. Even some dye sensitizers surpass YD2-o-C8 in stability and service life, which makes the development of dye sensitizer family take on a new look. In this paper, the experimental and theoretical progress of D-π-A zinc porphyrin dye sensitizer YD2-o-C8 and its derivatives are reviewed. The improvement of YD2-o-C8 in electron donor group, conjugated π-bridge and electron-acceptor and anchoring group and its influence on the photoelectric conversion performance are emphasized.

When the carrier system contains emulsified lipids, typical production steps may encompass premixing of raw materials including the drug, high-energy homogenization, filtration and filling of bottles followed by heat sterilization. This procedure is defined as drug incorporation de novo, in contrast to extemporaneous addition of a drug to a pre-formed emulsion. Changes in concentration or chemical composition of raw materials, including the pharmaceutically active ingredient, or changes in process conditions, including time, temperature and pressure, may have profound effects on physical properties and stability of the final product. Careful characterization of these properties is essential in order to minimize toxicity of the carrier system and optimize drug efficacy. First-generation drug emulsions, which are either in clinical trials or are being marketed, include Amphotericin B, Diazemuls®, Vitalipid®, prostaglandin E1 and Diprivan®. Second-generation formulations, which are currently being developed and evaluated, incorporate cytotoxics such as Perilla ketone, Penclomedine and taxol or anesthetics such as halothane or pregnanolone.

A major prerequisite for optimal image quality and a more confident diagnosis is the adequate luminal distension of the bowel, which is usually achieved by administering an intraluminal contrast agent through a nasojejunal catheter. Magnetic resonsance enteroclysis is a new technique that combines the advantages of volume challenge with state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse sequences, resulting in an excellent demonstration of the anatomy of the small bowel. Magnetic resonance enteroclysis compares favourably with conventional enteroclysis in detecting, localising and assessing the extent of involved small bowel segments. Luminal narrowing and extramural manifestations or complications of the disease can also be accurately assessed by the technique. Imaging features including the presence of deep ulcers, extensive wall thickening and mesenteric lymph nodes exhibiting marked gadolinium enhancement correlate strongly with disease activity. Although the clinical utility of magnetic resonsance enteroclysis in Crohn's disease has been widely recognised, its routine application is currently limited to academic centres. Its clinical indications may include follow-up studies of known disease, the classification of Crohn's disease subtypes, an estimation of disease activity and a determination of the extramucosal extent and spread of the disease process. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

NA,Environmental contaminant exposures and preterm birth: A comprehensive review,2013,NA,NA,"Preterm birth is a significant public health concern, as it is associated with high risk of infant mortality, various morbidities in both the neonatal period and later in life, and a significant societal economic burden. As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth. Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",NA

Relatively simple, with no requirement for labelling, homogenization, extraction or reconstitution, the technique has found a variety of applications in molecular biology, pathology, pharmacology and toxicology. By discriminating the spatial distribution of biomolecules in serial sections of tissues, biomarkers of lesions and the biological responses to stressors or diseases can be better understood in the context of structure and function.

Although ABA is registered as a farm chemical (plant growth regulator), its practical use has been limited, mainly due to its weak effect in field trials, which is considered to be due to its rapid inactivation through biodegradation. Catabolic inactivation of ABA is mainly controlled by ABA 8'-hydroxylase (CYP707A), which is the cytochrome P450 catalyzing the C8'-hydroxylation of ABA into 8'-hydroxy-ABA and its more stable tautomer, phaseic acid, which has much lower hormonal activity than ABA. Thus, a specific inhibitor of CYP707A is promising not only as a chemical probe for the mechanism of ABA action, but also because of its potential use in agriculture and horticulture. This review article focuses on our recent research on the development of two types of specific inhibitors of CYP707A: the ABA analogue-type inhibitors that were designed on the basis of differences between the structural requirements for CYP707A and for ABA activity, and the azole-type P450 inhibitors that were developed by conformational restriction or enlargement of the plant growth retardant uniconazole. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",aba 8' hydroxylase; abscisic acid; abscisic acid 8' hydroxylase inhibitor 1; abscisic acid 8' hydroxylase inhibitor 2; cytochrome P450; enzyme inhibitor; ifap1; ifap2; ifsp1; ifsp2; ifsp3; imi x; phaseic acid; phytohormone; pyrrole; pyrrole derivative; ufap1; ufap2; ufap3; unclassified drug; uni; uni x; unspecific monooxygenase; abscisic acid; abscisic acid 8' hydroxylase; abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase; cytochrome P450; enzyme inhibitor; phytohormone; pyrrole derivative; catabolism; catalysis; chemical structure; conformation; drought tolerance; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; hydroxylation; ligand binding; nonhuman; plant growth; review; seedling; tautomer; chemistry; drug antagonism; metabolism; Abscisic Acid; Azoles; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Enzyme Inhibitors; Plant Growth Regulators

Therefore, there is an increasing interest to investigate the gene expression as well as the presence and activity of proteins involved in FA metabolism. The attention on Peroxisome Proliferation Activate Receptors (PPARs) also prevails in fish species exposed to OC and in the transport, biosynthesis and β-oxidation of FA. Several studies have been conducted under controlled conditions to evaluate these biological aspects of fish species exposed to OC, as fibrates, endocrine disrupting compounds, perfluoroalkyl acids, flame retardants, metals and mixtures of organic compounds associated with a polluted area. However, only fibrates, which are agonists of PPARs, induce biological responses suitable to be considered as biomarkers of exposure to these pollutants. According to the documented findings on this topic, it is unlikely that these physiological aspects are suitable to be employed as biomarkers with some noticeable exceptions, which depend on experimental design. This emphasises the need to investigate the responses in fish treated with mixtures of OC and in wild fish species from polluted areas to validate or refute the suitability of these biomarkers for environmental or fish health monitoring. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic organisms; Biochemistry; Biomarkers; Cytology; Endocrine disrupters; Fish; Flame retardants; Gene expression; Lipids; Metabolism; Mixtures; Physiology; Pollution; Aquatic environments; Controlled conditions; Endocrine disrupting compound; Environmental Monitoring; Fatty acid metabolism; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Physicochemical property; PPARs; Fatty acids; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; fibric acid derivative; flame retardant; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; pesticide; plasticizer; biological marker; endocrine disruptor; fatty acid; fish protein; organic compound; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; water pollutant; xenobiotic agent; biomarker; environmental monitoring; fatty acid; fish; metabolism; organic pollutant; physiological response; pollution exposure; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; fatty acid transport; fish; gene expression; hydrophobicity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; pollution monitoring; pollution transport; protein function; Review; water pollution; animal; drug effects; environmental monitoring; fish; lipid metabolism; metabolism; procedures; toxicity; water pollutant; Pisces; Animals; Biomarkers; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Monitoring; Fatty Acids; Fish Proteins; Fishes; Lipid Metabolism; Organic Chemicals; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Xenobiotics"

PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors",Abstracting; Diagnosis; Organic chemicals; Anthropogenic organic chemicals; Bibliometrics analysis; Eco-toxicology; Map analysis; PFOA; PFOS; Systematic Review; ‘overview of review’; ‘systematic review’; ‘umbrella review’; Animals

These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022","Contamination; Environmental technology; Learning systems; Risk assessment; 'omics'; Chemical exposure; Chemical risk assessment; Contaminant exposure; Environmental epidemiology; Epidemiological studies; Population exposure; Study design; Systematic evidence map; ‘omic; Molecular biology; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; metal; perfluoro compound; pesticide; phthalic acid derivative; volatile organic compound; epidemiology; map; public health; risk assessment; air pollutant; data base; environmental exposure; environmental impact; epidemiology; epigenetics; health risk assessment; human; metabolomics; persistent organic pollutant; proteomics; Review; scientific literature; systematic review; toxicokinetics; transcriptomics; adverse event; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; reference value; risk assessment; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Reference Values; Risk Assessment"

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

The effects of environmental toxicants on maternal and fetal metabolic profile changes have not yet been summarized. This systematic review aims to summarize the current studies exploring the association between prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants and metabolic profile alterations in mother and fetus. We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database for relevant literature conducted up to September 18, 2019 with some key terms. From the initial 155 artides, 15 artides met the inclusion and exclusion aiteria, and consist of highly heterogeneous research methods. Seven studies assessed the effects of multiple environmental pollutants (metals, organic pollutants, nicotine, air pollutants) on the maternal urine and blood metabolomic profile; five studies evaluated the effects of arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nicotine, and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on the cord blood metabolomic profile; and one study assessed the effects of smoking exposure on the amniotic fluid metabolomic profile. The alteration of metabolic pathways in these studies mainly involve energy metabolism, hormone metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. No population study investigated the association between environmental toxicants and placental metabolomics. This systematic review provides evidence that prenatal exposure to a variety of environmental pollutants can affect maternal and fetal metabolomic characteristics. Integration of environmental toxicant exposure and metabolomics data in maternal-fetal samples is helpful to understand the interaction between toxicants and metabolites, so as to reveal the pathogenesis of fetal disease or diseases of fetal origin.

Based on the analysis of the interaction mechanism between antibiotics and heavy metals, the research progress of the main treatment technologies of wastewater polluted by antibiotics and heavy metals is reviewed, and the mechanism of action and advantages and disadvantages are summarized. The results showed that the interaction between antibiotics and heavy metals was affected by the types of functional groups, the types of heavy metal ions and the pH of the solution.

Obesity is associated with increased risk of knee OA. This systematic review involves a meta-regression and analysis to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and PFP and PFOA, and to determine the link between BMI and interventional outcomes. Methods We searched seven electronic databases and reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews, for cross-sectional, prospective, human-based observational and interventional studies reporting BMI in individuals with PFP or PFOA compared to healthy controls. Two independent reviewers appraised methodological quality (epidemiological appraisal instrument). Where possible, data from prospective studies were pooled to conduct meta-regression and case-control, and intervention studies to conduct meta-analysis using the following categories: adolescents with PFP, adults with PFP and PFOA. Results 52 studies were included. We found greater BMI in adults with PFP (standardised mean difference: 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36) and PFOA (0.73, 0.46 to 0.99) compared to healthy controls, but not in adolescents with PFP (-0.19,-0.56 to 0.18). We also observed statistical trends (p<0.10) towards higher BMI being a predictor for development of PFP in adults (0.34,-0.04 to 0.71).

Consequently, the sources of such pollution have been studied for the past 50 years, with the vehicular transportation sector and the atmospheric deposition identified early as the major pollution sources. In search for mitigation of this pollution, source controls, besides other measures, were recognised as effective pollution mitigation tools, whose successful implementation requires a good knowledge of pollution sources. Even though great research efforts have been exerted to document specific sources of urban runoff pollution, or specific groups of pollutants present in urban runoff, a comprehensive overview of all known contributing sources is still missing. This review contributes to closing this gap by compiling findings of previous research and critically synthesizing the current knowledge of various stormwater pollution sources. As the emphasis is placed on the sources, the related issues of implications for urban surface water quality and possible source controls for individual sources are touched upon just briefly, where required. The review showed that the atmospheric deposition, vehicular transportation-related activities and metallic building envelopes continue to be among the major pollution sources, which have been studied in a far greater detail than other sources. Furthermore, it was noted that because of the rapid advances in clean manufacturing and pollution control technologies, a large part of the body of data on stormwater quality available in the literature should be considered as historical data, which may no longer describe well the current conditions. Progressing historical data obsolescence, combined with continuing releases of new materials and chemicals, and, in some cases of new substances of potential concern, into the environment, suggests that the identification of important stormwater runoff/snowmelt pollution sources, and the associated pollutants, has been and will remain to be a work in progress. © 2019 The Authors",Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition; Deterioration; Meteorological problems; Obsolescence; Quality control; River pollution; Runoff; Sewage; Snow melting systems; Storm sewers; Storms; Water pollution control; Water quality; Diffuse pollution; Emerging pollutants; Snowmelt; Source control; Stormwater quality; Air pollution; storm water; surface water; chemical pollutant; pollutant source; pollution control; runoff; snowmelt; stormwater; urban pollution; water quality; atmospheric deposition; domestic waste; dumping; forest; gardening; human; industrialization; motor vehicle; nonhuman; pet animal; pollution monitoring; priority journal; recreational park; Review; runoff; snowmelt runoff; surface area; urban area; waste disposal; water pollution; water quality; wildlife

MBL (mannose-binding lectin) is part of the innate immune system (IIS), which is the host’s first line defense against pathogens. The IIS functions centrally by identifying pathogen-specific microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) with the help of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Studies have classified mannose-binding lectin (MBL) as one of the PRR molecules which belong to the C-type lectin family. The protective role of MBL lies in its ability to activate the complement system via the lectin pathway and there seems to be a direct link between the chicken’s health status and the MBL concentration in the serum. Several methods have been used to detect the presence, the level and the structure of MBL in chickens such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) among others. The concentration of MBL in the chicken ranges from 0.4 to 35 µg/mL and can be at peak levels at three to nine days at entry of pathogens. The variations observed are known to depend on the bacterial strains, breed and age of the chicken and possibly the feed manipulation strategies. However, when chicken MBL (cMBL) becomes deficient, it can result in malfunctioning of the innate immune system, which can predispose chickens to diseases. This article aimed to discuss the importance and components of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in chickens, its mode of actions, and the different methods used to detect MBL. Therefore, more studies are recommended to explore the causes for low and high cMBL production in chicken breeds and the possible effect of feed manipulation strategies in enhancing cMBL production. © 2021 by the authors.

In this review, the optimization of the opto-electronic property and device efficiency of polyfluorenes in the field of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic cells (PVs) by tuning structure and morphology are summarized in terms of two typical modification techniques: copolymerization and blending. The relationships between molecular structures, thin film morphologies, opto-electronic properties and device efficiencies are discussed, and some recent progress in LEDs and PVs is simultaneously reviewed. After the introduction, the basic knowledge of molecular structures and properties of polyfluorene homopolymers is presented as a background for a better understanding of their great potential for opto-electronic applications. Immediately after this, three different opinions on the origin of low-energy emission band at 520-540nm in polyfluorene-based LEDs are addressed. Rod-coil block copolymers and alternative copolymers are focused on in the next section, which are a vivid embodiment of controlling supramolecular structures and tailoring molecular structures, respectively. In particular, various supramolecular architectures induced by altering coil blocks are carefully discussed. Recent work that shows great improvement in opto-electronic properties or device performance by blending or doping is also addressed.

Environmental toxicants, especially those that disrupt normal placental and endothelial function, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of ubiquitous chemicals found in consumer products, the environment, and increasingly in drinking water. PFAS have been associated with a multitude of adverse health effects, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and more recently, HDP. In this review, we present epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for the link between PFAS and HDP and recommend next steps for research and prevention efforts. To date, epidemiological studies have assessed associations between only ten of the thousands of PFAS and HDP. Positive associations between six PFAS (PFOA, perfluorooctanoic acid; PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid; PFHxS, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid; PFHpA, perfluoroheptanoic acid; PFBS, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; and PFNA, perfluoronanoic acid) and risk for HDP have been reported in some, but not all, studies. PFAS disrupt placental and immune function, cause oxidative stress, and disrupt lipid metabolism. These physiological disruptions may be mechanisms through which PFAS can lead to HDP. Overall, limited epidemiological evidence and plausible mechanisms support PFAS as risk factors for HDP. More research is needed in diverse, well-powered cohorts that assess exposures to as many PFAS as possible. Such research should consider not only individual PFAS but also the totality of exposures to PFAS and other environmental chemicals. Pregnant women may be a group that is vulnerable to PFAS exposure, and as such HDP risk should be considered by policymakers setting PFAS exposure limits. In the interim, medical and public health professionals in regions with PFAS contamination could provide short-term solutions in the form of patient-level prevention, increased monitoring, and early intervention for HDP. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","endocrine disruptor; environmental chemical; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluoronanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; drinking water; epidemiology; health risk; hypertension; metabolism; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk factor; womens health; cardiovascular disease; contamination; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental policy; female; human; lipid metabolism; maternal hypertension; medical care; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiological stress; preeclampsia; prenatal exposure; priority journal; public health; Review; risk factor; environmental exposure; placenta; pollutant; pregnancy; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Placenta; Pregnancy; Risk Factors"

Over recent years, the question of concrete mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of bifidobacteria has been addressed in both animal and human studies. A possible candidate for this role has been discovered recently. The PFNA cluster, consisting of five core genes, pkb2, fn3, aaa-atp, duf58, tgm, has been found in all gut-dwelling autochthonous bifidobacterial species of humans. The sensory region of the species-specific serine-threonine protein kinase (PKB2), the transmembrane region of the microbial transglutaminase (TGM), and the type-III fibronectin domain-containing protein (FN3) encoded by the I gene imply that the PFNA cluster might be implicated in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Moreover, the FN3 protein encoded by one of the genes making up the PFNA cluster, contains domains and motifs of cytokine receptors capable of selectively binding TNF-α. The PFNA cluster could play an important role for sensing signals of the immune system. Among the practical implications of this finding is the creation of anti-inflammatory drugs aimed at alleviating cytokine storms, one of the dire consequences resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021 by the authors.

Its development has progressed over the past three decades as a clean and effective technique for wastewater treatment. Even though conventional EF has been shown to be a powerful process for efficient degradation/mineralization of toxic and/or persistent organic pollutants; it still suffers from some downsides for industrial-scale development. Recently, research has focused on improving its effectiveness and relevance, mainly by modifying certain operating parameters; improvements in electrode material and reactor configuration, as well as coupling with other treatment methods. Therefore, this review evaluates the current state of the EF process and presents the most recent advances such as 3D-EF, chelate-EF, self-powered EF, pulsed current EF, bio-EF, sono-EF, sulfite-EF, pyrite-EF, and ferrate-EF in addition to its emerging applications like disinfection, generation of value-added products, and removal of emerging pollutants from water. The suitability of different modified or hybrid-EF processes is discussed based on their performance in H2O2 generation, degradation kinetics, mineralization efficiency and cost effectiveness.

They are widely used in industrial and consumer applications and are known for their persistence, long-distance migration and toxicity. Various PFASs have been manufactured and distributed over the years at a global scale. Decades of relevant research on these emerging contaminants has revealed that PFASs are bioaccumulative and possibly carcinogenic to animals as well as humans. Following regulations and public concern about their impact on ecosystems and uncertain environmental fate, some legacy PFASs have been banned in some regions e.g. Europe, and their industrial production has switched to alternative fluoroalkyl substances. Recently, novel PFAS classes have been identified in numerous environmental matrices. The high variety of legacy and emerging PFASs across the ecosystems is alarming and calls for an efficient monitoring strategy for the quantitative determination of known substances as well as the elucidation and discovery of new compounds. This is crucial for PFAS management and risk assessment in the environment and merits the attention of regulators. This review reports and discusses the most recent analytical method development for PFASs in air, water, abiotic solid matrices and biological matrices. Various instrumental analysis techniques and screening approaches are presented, explored, and compared on the basis of their efficiency and applicability, together with sampling, pre-treatment and extraction methods.

Several countries, including the United States, plan to set an enforceable maximum contamination level for certain PFAS compounds in drinking water sources. Among the available treatment options, photocatalytic treatment is promising for PFAS degradation and mineralization in the aqueous solution. In this review, recent advances in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo-reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS by photo-oxidation involving the holes (hvb+) and oxidative radicals and photo-reduction using the electrons (ecb-) and hydrated electrons (eaq-) are integrated. The recent development of innovative heterogeneous photocatalysts and photolysis systems for enhanced degradation of PFAS is highlighted. Photodegradation mechanisms of alternative compounds, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), are also critically evaluated. This paper concludes by identifying major knowledge gaps and some of the challenges that lie ahead in the scalability and adaptability issues of photocatalysis for natural water treatment.

While it is agreed that it is primarily a polymerization process, giving rise to a distribution of mainly olefins and paraffins; the mechanism by which this occurs on catalysts is still a subject of much debate. Many of the FT features, such as deactivation, product distributions, kinetics and mechanism, and equilibrium aspects of the FT processes are still subjects of controversy, regardless of the progress that has been made so far. The effect of molecules co-feeding in FTS on these features is the main focus of this study. This review looks at some of these areas and tries to throw some light on aspects of FTS since the inception of the idea to date with emphasis and recommendation made based on nitrogen, water, ammonia, and olefins co-feeding case studies. © 2019 by the authors.

Over the last two decades, the prevalent view in chemical carcinogenesis has been that most free radicals do not bind to DNA. Recent studies, however, are demonstrating formation of adducts between DNA and free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals and aromatic cation radicals. 2. Within this context, we discuss the recent work from our group demonstrating DNA alkylation by carbon-centered radicals formed during biotransformation of genotoxic hydrazine derivatives both in vitro and in vivo. 3. The mutagenic potential of the identified methyl radical adduct, C8-methylguanine, is discussed, and other possible biological sources of carbon-centered radicals are presented.",carbon; DNA; free radical; hydrazine derivative; alkylation; animal; biotransformation; drug effect; gene; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; review; Alkylation; Animals; Biotransformation; Carbon; DNA; Free Radicals; Genes; Hydrazines; Oxidation-Reduction

The technologies present on the market to the present day still do not reach the ideal features desirable for such processes especially for the removal of highly recalcitrant compounds such as the Perfluorinated Alkyl Substances (PFAS) which are poorly abated using “traditional” Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs). The non-thermal plasma (NTP) treatment is a promising technology based on the production (in the water or immediately above the liquid) of a NTP capable of producing reactive species both in the liquid and gaseous phase. These species can react with stable and recalcitrant compounds (e.g. PFAS) up to their mineralization. In this review, the NTP technology and its applications in wastewater treatment are reviewed, starting from the physics of the plasma, the different processes and reactors proposed in the literature, and the nature of the reactive species generated during the plasma process. Attention is dedicated to the applications of NTP for the abatement of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs), with a focus on PFAS removal. Furthermore, the effects of the natural components of the waters, such as Natural Organic Matter (NOM), pH, and conductivity on the efficiency of NTP-based treatment are discussed. Lastly, based on an overall vision of the published literature on this topic and of the technologies available on the market to the present day, some conclusions regarding the future of this technology have been drawn. © 2022 The Author(s)",NA

It has been widely detected in environmental samples but there is limited information about the health effects on humans from environmental exposure. This paper presents the findings of a review of the literature on the impact of PFOS on the health of the general population. Fifteen relevant epidemiological studies were identified that looked at the association between human PFOS exposure and a range of health related outcomes. Small but statistically significant associations have been reported with PFOS and total cholesterol, glucose metabolism, body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, infertility, breast feeding, uric acid and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The true significance of these findings is uncertain due to the inconsistencies in some of the study results and the limitations of the literature. The majority of studies were cross-sectional and considered surrogate markers of health (e.g. cholesterol levels). The available literature is also limited in ascertaining the link between PFOS concentrations in the environment, exposure pathways and health effects. We conclude that the current evidence is inconclusive and further large-scale prospective cohort studies would be useful to assess the association between environmental exposure to PFOS, appropriate biomarkers (e.g. serum levels of PFOS) and health outcomes. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",cholesterol; glucose; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; testosterone; thyroglobulin; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; uric acid; alkanesulfonic acid; biological marker; fluorocarbon; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; pollutant; attention deficit disorder; bladder cancer; blood level; blood sampling; body mass; breast feeding; cancer incidence; cholesterol blood level; cross-sectional study; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; gestational age; glucose metabolism; high risk population; human; insulin resistance; liver cancer; Medline; metabolic syndrome X; pancreas cancer; population research; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; prostate cancer; review; self report; smoking; systematic review; thyroid function; thyroid hormone blood level; waist circumference; metabolism; pollutant; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Biological Markers; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons

A mechanism for the organ-specific toxicity to the kidney for these compounds has been elucidated. The mechanism involves hepatic glutathione conjugation to dihaloalkenyl or 1,1-difluoroalkyl glutathione S-conjugates, which are cleaved by γ-glutamyltransferase and dipeptidases to cysteine S-conjugates. Haloalkene-derived cysteine S-conjugates are substrates for renal cysteine conjugate β-lyases, which cleave them to form reactive intermediates identified as thioketenes (from chloroalkene-derived S-conjugates) or thionoacyl halides (from 1,1-difluoroalkyl S-conjugates). Alternatively, cysteine S-conjugates may be N-acetylated to excretable mercapturic acids. The formation of reactive intermediates by cysteine-conjugate β-lyase may play a role in the target-organ toxicity and in the possible renal tumorigenicity of several chlorinated olefins widely used in many chemical processes.","cysteine conjugate beta lyase; gamma glutamyltransferase; glutathione; haloolefin; carcinogenesis; drug carcinogenicity; drug specificity; human; kidney carcinoma; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; review; target organ; tissue specificity; Animals; Biotransformation; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases; Carcinogens; Glutathione; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Kidney; Kidney Neoplasms; Organ Specificity"

Many polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are potential perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors. When they are released to the environment, abiotic and microbial degradation of non-fluorinated functionalities, polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl moieties can result in perfluoroalkyl carboxylic (PFCAs) and sulfonic acids (PFSAs), such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). These highly persistent and ubiquitously detected PFAAs are the subjects of many regulations and actions due to their toxic profiles. In order to confidently evaluate the environmental fate and effects of these precursors and their links to PFSAs and PFCAs, we present the review into the environmental biodegradability studies carried out with microbial culture, activated sludge, soil and sediment in the past decade. First, we propose that the knowledge gap caused by the lack of direct detection of precursor chemicals in environmental samples can be bridged by laboratory investigations of important precursors such as fluorotelomer-based compounds and perfluoroalkane sulfonamido derivatives. Then we evaluate the experimental setups and methodologies, sampling and sample preparation methods, and analytical techniques that have been successfully applied. Third, we provide the most updated knowledge on quantitative and qualitative relationships between precursors and PFSAs or PFCAs, microbial degradation pathways, half-lives of precursors, defluorination potential, and novel degradation intermediates and products. In the end, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest research directions with regard to future biodegradation studies, environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological assessment of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Chemical detection; Industrial chemicals; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Ecotoxicological assessment; Laboratory investigations; Pathway; Perfluoroalkyl; Perfluorooctane sulfonic acids; Polyfluoroalkyl; Precursor; Sample preparation methods; Biodegradation; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorotelomer; fluorotelomer acrylate; fluorotelomer alcohol derivative; fluorotelomer citrate ester; fluorotelomer ethoxylate derivative; fluorotelomer methacrylate; fluorotelomer phosphate ester; fluorotelomer stearate ester; fluorotelomer sulfonate; fluorotelomer urethane derivative; n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol; perfluoroalkane sulfonamido derivative; perfluoroalkyl acid; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid derivative; perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyfluoroalkyl derivative; unclassified drug; activated sludge; biodegradation; environmental fate; microbial activity; microorganism; organofluorine; activated sludge; aerobic microbial degradation; anaerobic microbial degradation; analytic method; bacterium culture; biodegradability; defluorination; ecotoxicity; environment; environmental monitoring; half life time; methodology; microbial degradation; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; review; sampling; sediment; soil

Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a promising remediation technique for wastewater contaminated with PFCs. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that the ""non-active"" anodes, including boron-doped diamond, tin oxide, and lead dioxide, are effective in PFCs elimination in wastewater due to their high oxygen evolution potential. Many researchers have conducted experiments to investigate the optimal conditions (i.e., potential, current density, pH value, plate distance, initial PFCs concentration, electrolyte, and other factors) for PFCs elimination to obtain the maximal elimination efficiency and current efficiency. The EO mechanism and pathways of PFCs have been clearly elucidated, which undergo electron transfer, Kolbe decarboxylation or desulfonation, hydrolysis, and radical reaction. In addition, the safety evaluation and energy consumption evaluation of the EO technology have also been summarized to decrease toxic ion release from electrode and reduce the cost of this technique. Although the ultrasonication and hydrothermal techniques combined with the EO process can improve the removal efficiency and current efficiency significantly, these coupled techniques have not been commercialized and applied in industrial wastewater treatment.

This paper examines proposals for reproductive health activities under humanitarian health and protection funding mechanisms for 2002-2013, and the level at which these reproductive health proposals were funded. Methods: The study used English and French health and protection proposal data for 2002-2013, extracted from the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Every project was reviewed for relevance against pre-determined reproductive health definitions for 2002-2008. An in-depth analysis was additionally conducted for 2009-2013 through systematically reviewing proposals via a key word search and subsequently classifying them under designated reproductive health categories. Among the relevant reproductive health proposals, counts and proportions were calculated in Excel based on their reproductive health components, primarily by year. Contributions, requests, and unfunded requests were calculated based on the data provided by FTS. Results: Among the 11,347 health and protection proposals issued from 345 emergencies between 2002 and 2013, 3,912 were relevant to reproductive health (34.5%). The number of proposals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 21.9% per year, while the proportion of health and protection sector appeals containing reproductive health activities increased by an average of 10.1% per year. The total funding request over the 12 years amounted to $4.720 billion USD, of which $2.031 billion USD was received. Among reproductive health components for 2009-2013 proposals, maternal newborn health comprised the largest proportion (56.4%), followed by reproductive health-related gender-based violence (45.9%), HIV/sexually transmitted infections (37.5%), general reproductive health (26.2%), and lastly, family planning (14.9%). Conclusion: Findings show that more agencies are responding to humanitarian appeals by proposing to implement reproductive health programs and receiving increased aid over the twelve year period. While such developments are welcome, project descriptions show comparatively limited attention and programming for family planning and abortion care in particular. © 2015 Tanabe et al.",NA

In recent years, this continuous input has increased considerably, to the point that they were recognized as emerging pollutants by the scientific community, due to their persistence in the environment, and hazardous potential to ecosystems even at low concentrations. The number of studies in literature describing their worldwide presence in several environmental matrices is growing, and many of them indicate that the techniques employed for their safe removal tend to be ineffective. This is the case of conventional activated sludge treatment plants (WWTPs), where considerable loads of synthetic musks enter mainly through domestic sewage. This review paper compiles and discusses the occurrence of these compounds in the sewage, effluents and sludge, main concentration levels and phase distributions, as well as the efficiency of the different methodologies of removal applied in these treatment facilities. To the present day, it has been demonstrated that WWTPs lack the ability to remove musks completely.

EC research in Southeast Asia is especially critical due to its high population density and poor sanitation infrastructure that introduce large amounts of ECs into the aquatic environment. This literature Review investigated the status of EC research in 11 Southeast Asian countries. Key pharmaceutical groups such as antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethazine, ciprofloxacin, and lincomycin) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen) were among the most frequently studied group of ECs, while other significant groups of interests in this Review included per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalate esters (PAEs). With most Southeast Asian countries having agrarian economies and the onset of climate change, the overutilization of antibiotics and pesticides to meet the commercial demand for agriculture and livestock products is a major threat to aquatic environments and even human health in this region. This Review identifies understudied emerging contaminant groups in Southeast Asia such as disinfectants and transformation byproducts and recommends future research directions for Southeast Asia, particularly focusing on seasonal trends of EC input into surface and groundwater environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society.",NA

PFAS have become a global concern due to their toxicity and bio-accumulative properties. PFAS species have been ubiquitously detected in natural waters, wastewaters, sludge, and aquatic and terrestrial species which are anionic, zwitterionic and neutral. The ion exchange (IX) process for PFAS removal is an efficient technology for the remediation of PFAS-laden surface, ground and effluent wastewaters. This approach is more effective towards eliminating emerging short-chain PFAS which are not removed by carbon-based adsorption processes. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of PFAS removal from water via IX process. The evaluation and comparison of various IX resins in terms of kinetics and isotherms is presented. Literature data indicates that IX isotherm uptake capacity for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) can range up to 5 mmol/g on commercially available IX resins such as IRA 958 and IRA 67. The mechanism involved in the PFAS uptake process, such as diffusion, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects are discussed. The effects of the eluent variability on the regeneration efficacy are also highlighted and the effect of single-use vs reuse for newly developed PFAS-specific IX resins are also examined based on the reviewed literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Effluents; Hydrophobicity; Ion exchange resins; Isotherms; Adsorption process; Commercial applications; Efficient technology; Hydrophobic effect; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Perfluorooctanoic acid; State-of-the art reviews; Uptake capacity; Ion exchange; alkyl ether; carboxylic acid derivative; ion exchange resin; organic matter; polymer; resin; sulfonic acid derivative; water; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; ion exchange resin; anthropogenic effect; bioaccumulation; chemical substance; ion exchange; literature review; organic compound; pollutant removal; resin; wastewater treatment; adsorption; anion exchange; diffusion; human; hydrophobicity; isotherm; kinetics; nonhuman; practice guideline; regeneration; Review; static electricity; storage; waste component removal; waste disposal; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Ion Exchange Resins; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

These pollutants enter the human body through environmental exposure and dietary intake, causing adverse health effects. Although many of them have been banned and restricted in the production and use in China, these pollutants still remain in the human body due to their high persistence and strong bioaccumulation. In this review, we aim to reveal the accumulation levels and profiles, as well as the temporal and spatial distribution of common chemical pollutants including chlorinated paraffins (CPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers, organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), new halogenated flame retardants (NHFRs), polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalic acid esters, perfluorinated compounds, bisphenols, organophosphorus pesticides and pyrethroid insecticides in the blood (including whole blood, serum and plasma) of Chinese adults by extracting 93 related studies published from 1990 to 2021.

Under the strict control of pollutants in China, the levels of most pollutants have been on a downward trend except for perfluoro octanoate and perfluoro nonanoate. Besides, OPFRs, NHFRs and PAHs may have a potential upward trend, requiring further research and observation.

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Among many technologies, adsorption has proven to be an effective and inexpensive technique for water and wastewater treatment. Biochar has been identified as a promising and low-cost material, which can be produced from various carbonaceous materials with different origins, compositions, and processing methods. Consequently, the interaction between biochars and adsorbate species is not simple and may involve different adsorption mechanisms, such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, surface complexation, ion-exchange, hydrophobic interactions, π-interactions, co-precipitation, partition, and pore-filling. In addition, many operating conditions can affect the performance of adsorption processes. However, the development of biochars as competitive adsorbent materials depends on standardization, continuous-supply, application, and regulation.

We found that the nutritional, physicochemical, and sensory properties of fried mackerel without treatment were influenced by frying methods. Deep frying affected the oxidation of lipids and degradation of proteins, while air frying increased the overall acceptance score. Frying can reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), eliminate some toxins, lower the trypsin inhibitor (TI), and increase the sensory parameters of mackerel with batter, marinade, and spice treatment. The different ingredients of minced mackerel products preserved their nutritional and sensory parameters after frying. Interestingly, vacuum frying resulted in lower oxidation and maintenance of nutritional and sensory parameters of fried mackerel (with or without treatment) and minced mackerel products. Further research is needed to reveal the effectiveness of vacuum frying in maintaining the nutritional and sensory properties of fried and minced mackerel products. © 2021 by the authors.

Many ventilation techniques have proved beneficial in small trials of very specific patient groups, but most have subsequently failed to translate into improved patient outcome in larger trials. An exception to this is 'protective ventilation' using reduced tidal volumes (to lower airway pressure) and increased PEEP (to reduce pulmonary collapse). Results of trials of protective ventilation have been encouraging, and the technique should now be adopted more widely. High frequency ventilation, inverse ratio ventilation, prone positioning and inhaled nitric oxide are all techniques that may be considered when, in spite of optimal artificial ventilation, the patient's gas exchange remains dangerously poor. Under these circumstances, the choice of technique is dependent on their availability, local expertise and individual patient needs.","antibiotic agent; cytokine; endotoxin; fluorocarbon; nitric oxide; oleic acid; oxygen; perfluorooctyl bromide; placebo; steroid; adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway obstruction; airway pressure; artificial ventilation; atelectasis; bacterial translocation; barotrauma; bleeding; body posture; breathing mechanics; clinical trial; dose response; drug efficacy; health care availability; health care need; high frequency ventilation; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypercapnia; hyperglycemia; hyperoxia; hypoxemia; kidney failure; liquid ventilation; lung collapse; lung edema; lung gas exchange; lung inflation; lung injury; lung ventilation; lung volume; methemoglobinemia; mortality; nonhuman; patient positioning; pneumonia; pneumothorax; positive end expiratory pressure; pressure volume curve; protection; quality of life; review; skill; tidal volume; treatment failure; treatment outcome; ventilator; Humans; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Posture; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Respiratory Mechanics"

About 74 studies, mainly focusing on food traceability issues and published during 2000-2013, were reviewed.

Because FTs are in near constant contact with human milk and/or formula, rapid and extensive bacterial growth is possible. Due to their immature immunologic and gastrointestinal (GI) systems, infants may be at significant health risk due to FT colonization. In adults, length of time FTs remain in place (dwell time) affects the degree of colonization and biofilm formation which is important in infants whose tubes remain in place up to 30 days. Objective: The purpose of this review was to describe and summarize the evidence regarding FT bacterial colonization in infants and identify gaps needing further investigation. Methods: Medline, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for clinical and/or laboratory-based observational and randomized controlled studies investigating the presence of bacteria in neonatal FTs. Results: This review of 10 studies found evidence that neonatal FTs may contain high quantities of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and longer dwell times may increase the bacterial load. Furthermore, evidence suggests FT colonization may be nosocomial in origin and contribute to adverse infant health. Feeding tubes are an unrecognized source of bacterial colonization which may increase morbidity in premature infants and thus the presence of bacteria in FTs is an important area of investigation in the nutritional care of vulnerable infants in the NICU. Implications: Further appropriately powered studies which are clinically based, use appropriate analyses, and control for potential covariates are necessary to make clinical recommendations.

The Z-ring consists of a bundle of laterally bound protofilaments formed in result of FtsZ polymerization. Z-ring is rigidly bounded to the cytosolic side of the inner membrane with the participation of FtsA, ZipA, FtsW and many other divisome cell division proteins. The ring directs the process of cytokinesis transmitting constriction power to the membrane. The primary structures of the prokaryotic FtsZ family members significantly differ from eukaryotic tubulins except for the sites of GTP binding. There is a high degree of structural homology between these proteins in the region. FtsZ is one of the most conserved proteins in prokaryotes. However, ftsZ genes have not been found in several species of microorganisms with completely sequenced genomes. They include two species of mycoplasmas (Ureaplasma parvum and Mycoplasma mobile), Prostecobacter dejongeii, 10 species of chlamydia and 5 species of archaea. Consequently, these organisms divide without FtsZ participation. The genomes of U. parvum and M. mobile have many open reading frames which encode proteins with unknown functions. A comparison of the primary structures of these hypothetical proteins did not identify any known cell division proteins. We hypothesize that the process of cell division in these organisms should involve proteins similar to FtsZ in function and homologous to FtsZ or other cell division proteins in structure. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2007.",Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlamydia; Eukaryota; Mycoplasma; Mycoplasma mobile; Mycoplasmatales; Prokaryota; Ureaplasma; Ureaplasma parvum

The FTS products are predominantly linear, since purified synthesis gases are used converting into sulfur and nitrogen free products. In this review the usage of bifunctional catalysts, where major contribution of promoters likes Rh-, Ru- with different modifiers like Zr, Ga, Si, Al, B, Cr, Ce, etc. and different supports like zeolites (ZSM-5), silica and alumina have been discussed. Selective synthesis of gasoline to higher-range hydrocarbons (C 5+-C18+) and more have been discussed in different schematic ways, by considering different heterogeneous catalyst preparation techniques using various process parameters like mole H2/CO, CO 2/(CO+CO2) ratios, pressures, temperatures, gas hourly space velocity and their effect on the CO% conversion. Catalytic activity and product selectivity studies with various methods of catalyst preparation technique and the characterization of different catalysts has also been discussed through this work. Different methods to modify the product distribution through thermo-chemical route by combining reaction engineering and improved catalysis synthesis techniques have been covered in this review.This may be realized through the development of new engineered catalysts tuned with careful control of mass transport effects.

Yet of those thousands of chemicals, only just over one thousand have been formally examined and graded for their carcinogenic potential. Of those, five hundred have been found worthy of being graded on a cautiously worded scale ranging from ""known""carcinogens to ""possibly""carcinogenic. In addition to carcinogenic substances, a new field has emerged researching how environmental toxins cause endocrine or hormonal disruption. A class of these compounds known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can be found in our food, our environment, and in the products we put on our bodies. Rather than being directly linked to causing cancer, like substances such as asbestos, EDCs influence our health by mimicking or enhancing or changing metabolic regulation. These compounds interfere with hormone production and metabolism in ways that may-especially over the long term-create biological conditions that make us more susceptible to cancer and other diseases. Most of us are exposed to a cocktail of environmental toxins on an ongoing daily basis and at a relatively low level of exposure. Given the lax regulation of chemicals and the reactionary approach of government regulators, it is up to the consumer to be diligent about reading labels and making healthy choices to limit exposure to chemicals and toxins. It is ideal to adopt the Precautionary Principle: until a chemical is found to be harmless, try to not use it. The precautionary principle means that you are maintaining awareness of what you are putting on and in your body and taking steps to avoid exposing yourself unnecessarily to toxins in your household and environment. © 2019 the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; asbestos; carcinogen; endocrine disruptor; flame retardant; formaldehyde; perfluoro compound; phthalic acid; vinyl chloride; awareness; cancer susceptibility; carcinogenicity; consumer; environmental exposure; environmental protection; geography; government regulation; health hazard; hormone synthesis; household; human; long term exposure; malignant neoplasm; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; pollution; Review"

The mechanism by which peroxisome proliferators exert their beneficial (hypolipidemia) as well as their toxic (cancer) effects is still largely unknown. Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) is a potent peroxisome proliferator in rodent liver that resembles other members of this chemical class in many aspects, including its effects on gene expression and fatty acid metabolism. However, there are many dissimilarities between PFDA and hypolipidemic peroxisome proliferators that have not been extensively explored. PFDA is unlike other peroxisome proliferators in parent compound metabolism, hypolipidemia, and tumor promotion.

NA,Signaling in a polluted world: Oxidative stress as an overlooked mechanism linking contaminants to animal communication,2016,NA,NA,"The capacity to communicate effectively with other individuals plays a critical role in the daily life of an individual and can have important fitness consequences. Animals rely on a number of visual and non-visual signals, whose production brings costs to the individual. The theory of honest signaling states that these costs are higher for low than for high-quality individuals, which prevents cheating and makes signals, such as skin and plumage coloration, indicators of individual's quality or condition. The condition-dependent nature of signals makes them ideally suited as indicators of environmental quality, implying that signal production might be affected by contaminants. In this mini-review article, we have made the point that oxidative stress (OS) is one overlooked mechanism linking exposure to contaminants to signaling because (i) many contaminants can influence the individual's oxidative balance, and (ii) generation of both visual and non-visual signals is sensitive to OS. To this end, we have provided the first comprehensive review on the way both non-organic (heavy metals, especially mercury) and organic [persistent organic pollutants (POPs)] contaminants may influence either OS or sexual signaling. We have also paid special attention to emerging classes of pollutants like brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFAs) in order to stimulate research in this area. We have finally provided suggestions and warnings for future work on the links among OS, sexual signaling, and contaminant exposure. © 2016 Marasco and Costantini.",NA

Because of their unique structural characteristics and diverse functional groups, COFs have been used in various application fields, such as adsorption, catalysis, separation, ion conduction, and energy storage. Among COFs, the fluorine-containing COFs (fCOFs) have been developed for special applications by virtue of special physical and chemical properties resulting from fluorine element, which is a nonmetallic halogen element and possesses strong electronegativity. In the organic chemistry field, introducing fluorine into chemicals enables those chemicals to exhibit many interesting properties, and fluorine chemistry increasingly plays an important role in the history of chemical development. The introduction of fluorine in COFs can enhance the crystallinity, porosity, and stability of COFs, making COFs having superior performances and some new applications. In this review, the synthesis and application of fCOFs are systematically summarized. The application involves photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide, photocatalytic water splitting, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, adsorption for different substances (H2, pesticides, per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, bisphenols, and positively charged organic dye molecules), oil−water separation, energy storage (e.g., zinc-ion batteries, lithium−sulfur batteries), and proton conduction.

Their resistance to degradation, however, means that PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment and bioaccumulate. PFAS exposure has also been linked to a variety of adverse health effects. Occupational PFAS exposure is of particular concern as research on PFAS exposure in worker populations has historically been limited and generally restricted to fluorochemical plant workers involved in PFAS production. Methods: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed scientific literature was conducted to investigate which worker populations may experience occupational exposure to PFAS. Serum PFAS levels reported in various occupations were analyzed and compared to serum PFAS levels published on the general public exposed to PFAS-contaminated drinking water and the study population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results: Our analysis indicates that professional ski waxers and firefighters may be exposed to several different PFAS at levels often similar to or higher than levels among fluorochemical plant workers and individuals in communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking water, and higher than levels in the general public. PFAS serum level data on other occupations were largely absent. Conclusions: Results highlight a need for additional research on occupational PFAS exposures and concomitant environmental exposures in these populations. Research on exposure levels in occupations and industries known or suspected to utilize PFAS is critically needed to foster informed recommendations for exposure mitigation measures to protect workers from adverse health effects of PFAS exposure. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",NA

It requires the association of FtsZ with other proteins to assemble a dynamic ring during septation, forming part of the functionally active division machinery, the divisome. FtsZ reversibly interacts with FtsA and ZipA at the cytoplasmic membrane to form a proto-ring, the first molecular assembly of the divisome, which is ultimately joined by the rest of the division-specific proteins. In this review we summarize the quantitative approaches used to study the activity, interactions, and assembly properties of FtsZ under well-defined solution conditions, with the aim of furthering our understanding of how the behavior of FtsZ is controlled by nucleotides and physiological ligands. The modulation of the association and assembly properties of FtsZ by excluded-volume effects, reproducing in part the natural crowded environment in which this protein has evolved to function, will be described. The subsequent studies on the reactivity of FtsZ in membrane-like systems using biochemical, biophysical, and imaging technologies are reported. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges to be met to achieve construction of the minimum protein set needed to initiate bacterial division, without cells, in a cell-like compartment. This integrated approach, combining quantitative and synthetic strategies, will help to support (or dismiss) conclusions already derived from cellular and molecular analysis and to complete our understanding on how bacterial division works. © 2013 International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli

Not only is oxygen the driving force for many cellular functions and metabolism, but it is also involved in regulating stem cell fate, morphogenesis, and organogenesis. Low oxygen levels are the naturally preferred microenvironment for most processes during early development and mainly drive proliferation. Later on, more oxygen and also nutrients are needed for organogenesis and morphogenesis. Therefore, it is critical to maintain oxygen levels within a narrow range as required during development. Modulating oxygen tensions is performed via oxygen homeostasis mainly through the function of hypoxia-inducible factors. Through the function of these factors, oxygen levels are sensed and regulated in different tissues, starting from their embryonic state to adult development. To be able to mimic this process in a tissue engineering setting, it is important to understand the role and levels of oxygen in each developmental stage, from embryonic stem cell differentiation to organogenesis and morphogenesis. Taking lessons from native tissue microenvironments, researchers have explored approaches to control oxygen tensions such as hemoglobin-based, perfluorocarbon-based, and oxygen-generating biomaterials, within synthetic tissue engineering scaffolds and organoids, with the aim of overcoming insufficient or nonuniform oxygen levels and nutrient supply. © 2018 © 2018 S.

Long term consequences of the newborns' contamination by PFAS on thyroid function are of concern. The aim of this study is to assess the potential associations between PFAS contamination measured at birth and thyroid function assessed few months later. PFAS levels were previously determined in cord blood from a cohort of newborns recruited in Liege. METHOD: Parents of the children belonging to the first and the fifth quintiles of exposure to PFAS were contacted in order to measure the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their child few months after birth. Twenty-eight children participated in the study. Moreover, we performed a literature review about associations between pre- or perinatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants and thyroid function during early childhood. RESULT: No significant difference was highlighted between both groups of contamination (Mann-Whitney, p-value = 0.91). Literature review highlighted the critical need of new longitudinal data about this problematic. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the PFAS levels at birth are not associated with TSH levels later in life. Large scale studies are required to confirm our results.Objectif : Notre but est d’étudier les associations potentielles entre contamination par les composés perfluorés (PFC) mesurée à la naissance et fonction thyroïdienne évaluée quelques mois plus tard. Les niveaux de PFC ont été déterminés précédemment dans le sang de cordon de nouveau-nés recrutés à Liège. Méthode : Les parents des enfants appartenant au premier et cinquième quintiles d’exposition aux PFC ont été contactés pour mesurer les niveaux de thyréostimuline (TSH) chez leurs enfants quelques mois après la naissance. Vingt-huit enfants ont été recrutés. De plus, nous avons réalisé une revue de littérature concernant les associations entre exposition pré- ou périnatale aux polluants organiques persistants (POP) et fonction thyroïdienne pendant la petite enfance. Résultat : Aucune différence significative n’a été mise en évidence entre les deux groupes de contamination (Mann-Whitney, p = 0,91). Selon, la revue de la littérature, il est indispensable de disposer de nouvelles données longitudinales relatives à la relation entre contamination par les POP et fonction thyroïdienne. Conclusion : Nos résultats suggèrent que les concentrations de PFC à la naissance ne sont pas associées aux niveaux de TSH au cours de la vie.

In this study, we characterize the expression of p75NTR in sensory neurones of the newborn rat DRG using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we investigate the change in constitutive expression pattern of p75NTR in these neurones following axotomy. In the C7 and C8 DRG of the newborn rat, p75NTR is expressed in approximately 70% of DRG neurones. Those expressing p75NTR can be classified into subpopulations with moderate or intense p75NTR expression,each present in approximately equal proportions. Whilst p75NTR expression is observed in neurones throughout the entire neuronal diameter range, a correlation exists between neuronal diameter and p75NTR expression intensity. We also found that the most vulnerable population following axotomy were those sensory neurones which constitutively express the highest levels of p75NTR, i.e. the large-diameter neurones.","neurotrophin receptor; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; cell death; cell degeneration; cell size; cell subpopulation; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; immunohistochemistry; male; nerve cell necrosis; nerve fiber transection; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein family; rat; receptor affinity; review; sensory nerve cell; spinal ganglion; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Axotomy; Biological Markers; Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide; Cell Death; Female; Ganglia, Spinal; Male; Neurons, Afferent; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor; Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor; Substance P; Animalia"
NA,Developmental Exposure to Environmental Chemicals and Metabolic Changes in Children,2016,NA,NA,"The incidence of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other forms of metabolic disease have been rising over the past several decades. Although diet and physical activity play important roles in these trends, other environmental factors also may contribute to this significant public health issue. In this article, we discuss the possibility that widespread exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases in children. We summarize the epidemiological evidence on exposure to environmental chemicals during early development and metabolic outcomes in infants and children. Prenatal exposure to EDCs, particularly the persistent organic pollutant DDT and its metabolite DDE, may influence growth patterns during infancy and childhood. The altered growth patterns associated with EDCs vary according to exposure level, sex, exposure timing, pubertal status, and age at which growth is measured. Early exposure to air pollutants also is linked to impaired metabolism in infants and children. As a result of these and other studies, professional health provider societies have called for a reduction in environmental chemical exposures. We summarize the resources available to health care providers to counsel patients on how to reduce chemical exposures. We conclude with a discussion of environmental policies that address chemical exposures and ultimately aim to improve public health. © 2016 Mosby, Inc.",NA

Here we reviewed sorption coefficients for PFCs derived from laboratory experiments and compared these values with the gross distribution between the concentrations of PFCs in surface waters and sediments or between wastewater and sewage sludge. Sorption experiments with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) suggest that their sorption can be described reasonably well as a partitioning-like process with an average logKoc of approximately 2.8 for PFOA and 3.0 for PFOS. However, median concentrations in sediments (PFOA, 0.27ngg-1; PFOS, 0.54ngg-1) or sewage sludge (PFOA, 37ngg-1; PFOS, 69ngg-1) in relation to median concentrations in surface water (PFOA, 3ngl-1; PFOS, 3ngl-1) or wastewater treatment effluent (PFOA, 24ngl-1; PFOS, 11ngl-1), suggest that effective logKoc distribution coefficients for the field situation may be close to 3.7 for PFOA and 4.2 for PFOS. Applying lab-based logKoc distribution coefficients can therefore result in a serious overestimation of PFC concentrations in water and in turn to an underestimation of the residence time of PFOA and PFOS in contaminated soils.

NA,Associations between human internal chemical exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes: Systematic review and evidence map of human epidemiological evidence,2021,NA,NA,"The impact of environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on reproductive health is still poorly understood, despite the high societal and economical costs. The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented ‘serious’ or ‘very serious’ risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods. Globally, we judged the level of evidence being “low”. Given the high economical and societal costs associated to infertility and IVF, further well-designed research is urged to fill the highlighted gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",NA

They have been extensively produced since 1940s due to enormous applications as a surface-active agent, and water and oil repellent characteristics. PFASs are made to be non-biodegradable, therefore, many of them have been found in the environment albeit strict regulations have been in place since 2002. PFASs are extremely toxic compounds that can impart harm in both fauna and flora. Recent investigations have shown that wetlands might be useful for their removal from the environment as a passive and nature-based solution. To this end, understanding the role of plants, microbes, and their combined plant-microbe interplay is crucial because it could help design a sophisticated passive treatment wetland system. This review focuses on how these components (plants, microbe, substrate) can influence PFASs removal in wetlands under natural and controlled conditions. The information on underlying removal mechanisms is mostly retrieved from laboratory-based studies; however, pilot- and field-scale data are also presented to provide insights on their real-time performance. Briefly, a traditional wetland system works on the principles of phytouptake, bioaccumulation, and sorption, which are mainly due to the fact that PFASs are synthetic compounds that have very low reactivity in the environment. Nevertheless, recent investigations have also shown that Feammox process in wetlands can mineralize the PFASs; thus, opens new opportunities for PFASs degradation in terms of effective plant-microbe interplay in the wetlands. The choice of plants and bacterial species is however crucial, and the system efficiency relies on species-specific, sediment-specific and pollutant-specific principles. More research is encouraged to identify genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that can help us harness effective plant-microbe interplay in wetlands for the successful removal of PFASs from the environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Petroleum prospecting; Sorption; Surface active agents; Surface chemistry; Aliphatic compound; In planta bioaccumulation; Organofluorine; Phytouptake; Plant-microbe interplay; Poly-fluoroalkyl substance removal; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Surface active water; Surface-active agents; Wetland systems; Wetlands; chemical compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; polyfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; fluorocarbon; water; bioaccumulation; chemical compound; fauna; flora; pollutant removal; real time; sorption; wetland; chemical analysis; environmental factor; genetic analysis; microorganism; physical chemistry; plant; Review; synthesis; wetland; plant; water pollutant; wetland; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fluorocarbons; Plants; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wetlands"

Such claims have been underpinned by an impressive series of scientific advances that have resulted in the isolation of genes encoding most of the enzymes directly involved in oil biosynthesis. In some cases, these enzymes have even been re-engineered by site-directed or random mutagenesis to allow production of new fatty acid profiles that are not present in any existing organism. This has opened up the prospect of engineering 'designer oil crops' to produce novel fatty acids with chain lengths from C8 to C24 and with a wide range of industrially useful functionalities, including hydroxylation, epoxidation, and conjugated and non-conjugated double or triple bonds. However, there remain significant technical challenges before this promise of designer transgenic crops is likely to be translated into large-scale commercial reality. For example, it has proved surprisingly difficult to engineer high levels of novel fatty acids in genetically engineered transgenic plants, although many wild type seeds can readily accumulate 90-95% of a single fatty acid in their storage oil. Another complication is the recent discovery of multiple pathways of triacylglycerol biosynthesis and the difficulty in ensuring that novel fatty acids are only channelled towards storage triacylglycerols and not to membrane or signalling lipids in major target crops like rapeseed. New findings from our lab have suggested that there may also be problems with the tissue specificity of some of the 'seed-specific' gene promoters that are commonly used in transgenic crops. There are also considerable and often underestimated challenges associated with the economics, management and public acceptability of all transgenic crops, even for non-food use. In most cases the projections of petroleum reserves over the next few decades make it unlikely that crop-derived commodity products that substitute for petroleum will be competitive. Also the scale of crop production required to generate millions of tonnes of commodity oils, e.g., for biodegradable plastics, is likely to seriously impinge on food production at a time of increasing global populations, and is therefore unlikely to be acceptable. An alternative strategy to transgenic oil crops is to use molecular breeding techniques in order to develop new crops that already synthesise high levels of novel fatty acids of interest. Finally, the most promising market sectors and product ranges for the future development of oil crop biotechnology will be discussed. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",diacylglycerol; fatty acid; triacylglycerol; vegetable oil; enzyme engineering; epoxidation; fatty acid synthesis; food industry; gene expression; gene isolation; hydroxylation; nonhuman; oil industry; plant biotechnology; plant genetics; plant oil processing; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; review; site directed mutagenesis; tissue specificity; transgenic plant; Sinapis arvensis

This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17 cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. Results/Conclusions: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR™, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR™ in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.","dipeptidyl peptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase 8; dipeptidyl peptidase 9; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; fibroblast activation protein; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; microsomal aminopeptidase; serine proteinase; transforming growth factor beta1; unclassified drug; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; cytokine production; DNA synthesis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; enzyme specificity; fibroblast; immune response; inflammatory disease; keratinocyte; lymphocyte; nonhuman; priority journal; review; signal transduction; skin inflammation; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; tissue distribution; Animals; Antigens, CD13; Antigens, CD26; Humans; Protease Inhibitors; Skin Diseases"

Evolution has equipped these molecules with superior drug-like properties such as high specificity and potency. However, native peptides and proteins suffer from an inadequate pharmacokinetic profile, and their outstanding pharmacological potential can only be realized if this issue is addressed during drug development. To overcome this challenge, a variety of half-life extension techniques relying on covalent chemical modification have been developed. These methods include PEGylation, fusion to unstructured polypeptide-based PEG mimetics, conjugation of large polysaccharides, native-like glycosylation, lipidation, fusion to albumin or the Fc domain of IgG, and derivatization with bio-orthogonal moieties that direct self-assembly. This review provides an overview of available conjugation chemistries, biophysical properties, and safety data associated with these concepts. Moreover, the effects of these modifications on peptide and protein pharmacokinetics are demonstrated through key examples. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes such as Nafion are currently used for PEMFCs in industry, despite suffering from reduced proton conductivity due to dehydration at higher temperatures. However, operating at temperatures below 100 °C leads to cathode flooding, catalyst poisoning by CO, and complex system design with higher cost. Research has concentrated on the membrane material and on preparation methods to achieve high proton conductivity, thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, low fuel crossover and lower cost at high temperatures. Non-fluorinated polymers are a promising alternative. However, improving the efficiency at higher temperatures has necessitated modifications and the inclusion of inorganic materials in a polymer matrix to form a composite membrane can be an approach to reach the target performance, while still reducing costs. This review focuses on recent research in composite PEMs based on non-fluorinated polymers. Various inorganic fillers incorporated in the PEM structure are reviewed in terms of their properties and the effect on PEM fuel cell performance. The most reliable polymers and fillers with potential for high temperature proton exchange membranes (HTPEMs) are also discussed. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",NA

Around a decade later, this group of radiatively active compounds was expanded to include a large number of replacements for ozone-depleting substances such as chlorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), bromofluorocarbons, and bromochlorofluorocarbons. This paper systematically reviews the published literature concerning the radiative efficiencies (REs) of CFCs, bromofluorocarbons and bromochlorofluorocarbons (halons), HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, and related halogen containing compounds. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and self-consistent set of new calculations of REs and global warming potentials (GWPs) for these compounds, mostly employing atmospheric lifetimes taken from the available literature. We also present global temperature change potentials for selected gases. Infrared absorption spectra used in the RE calculations were taken from databases and individual studies and from experimental and ab initio computational studies. Evaluations of REs and GWPs are presented for more than 200 compounds. Our calculations yield REs significantly (> 5%) different from those in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for 49 compounds. We present new RE values for more than 100 gases which were not included in AR4. A widely used simple method to calculate REs and GWPs from absorption spectra and atmospheric lifetimes is assessed and updated. This is the most comprehensive review of the radiative efficiencies and global warming potentials of halogenated compounds performed to date. Key Points We review REs of CFCs,Bromocarbons and halons, HCFCs,HFCs,PFCs, SF6,NF3. We present calculations of REs and GWPs for these compounds.

In particular, perfluorinated (fully fluorinated) compounds (PFCs) have the potential to persist in the environment. But, until recently, the extent and magnitude of environmental distribution of PFCs was unknown. Recent development of an analytical technique for PFCs using high performance liquid chromatography-negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESMSMS) permitted the survey of PFCs in livers and blood plasma of wildlife on a global scale.","fluorocarbon; animal; audiovisual equipment; chemistry; environmental monitoring; human; methodology; review; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Models, Structural"

PFC fluids are biologically inert, have a high gas solubility and a low surface tension, and are nonbiotransformable. With liquid ventilation, alveolar pressures are low because the high surface tension of the gas-lung interface in eliminated.

Despite the many efforts made to understand the mechanisms of TA-TMA, its pathogenesis is largely unknown, its diagnosis is challenging and the case-fatality rate remains high. The hallmarks of TA-TMA, as for any TMA, are platelet consumption, hemolysis, and organ dysfunction, particularly the kidney, leading also to hypertension. However, coexisting complications, such as infections and/or immune-mediated injury and/or drug toxicity, together with the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria, render the diagnosis difficult. During the last 10 years, evidence has been provided on the involvement of the complement system in the pathophysiology of TA-TMA, supported by functional, genetic, and therapeutic data. Complement dysregulation is believed to collaborate with other proinflammatory and procoagulant factors to cause endothelial injury and consequent microvascular thrombosis and tissue damage. However, data on complement activation in TA-TMA are not sufficient to support a systematic use of complement inhibition therapy in all patients. Thus, it seems reasonable to propose complement inhibition therapy only to those patients exhibiting a clear complement activation according to the available biomarkers. Several agents are now available to inhibit complement activity: two drugs have been successfully used in TA-TMA, particularly in pediatric cases (eculizumab and narsoplimab) and others are at different stages of development (ravulizumab, coversin, pegcetacoplan, crovalimab, avacopan, iptacopan, danicopan, BCX9930, and AMY-101). © 2022 by the authors.","avacopan; bcx 9930; complement component C1; complement component C1q; complement component C3a; complement component C3b receptor; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C6; complement component C7; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement membrane attack complex; crovalimab; daclizumab; danicopan; decay accelerating factor; defibrotide; dextro tyrosylisoleucylcysteinylvalyl 1 methyltryptophylglutaminylaspartyltryptophyl n methylglycylalanylhistidylarginylcysteinyl n methylisoleucinamide 3,13 cyclic sulfide; eculizumab; immunosuppressive agent; iptacopan; mannan binding lectin associated serine proteinase; membrane cofactor protein; narsoplimab; nomacopan; pegcetacoplan; ravulizumab; rituximab; unclassified drug; von Willebrand factor cleaving proteinase; complement activation; complement inhibition; complement system; drug mechanism; endothelium injury; gene deletion; gene identification; genetic predisposition; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemolytic uremic syndrome; high throughput sequencing; human; medical history; microvascular thrombosis; mismatched unrelated donor; myeloablative conditioning; nonhuman; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; Review; risk factor; sex difference; thrombotic microangiopathy"

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of epidemiologic studies evaluating the association between environmental chemicals with DNA methylation levels in adults. After excluding arsenic, recently evaluated in a systematic review, we identified a total of 17 articles (6 on cadmium, 4 on lead, 2 on mercury, 1 on nickel, 1 on antimony, 1 on tungsten, 5 on persistent organic pollutants and perfluorinated compounds, 1 on bisphenol A, and 3 on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The selected articles reported quantitative methods to determine DNA methylation including immunocolorimetric assays for total content of genomic DNA methylation, and microarray technologies, methylation-specific quantitative PCR, Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), and bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation content of genomic sites such as gene promoters, LINE-1, Alu elements, and others. Considering consistency, temporality, strength, dose-response relationship, and biological plausibility, we concluded that the current evidence is not sufficient to provide inference because differences across studies and limited samples sizes make it difficult to compare across studies and to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Important questions for future research include the need for larger and longitudinal studies, the validation of findings, and the systematic evaluation of the dose-response relationships.

NA,Effects of Maternal Reproductive Investment on Sex-Specific Pollutant Accumulation in Seabirds: A Meta-Analysis,2019,NA,NA,"Avian egg production demands resources such as lipids and proteins. Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",NA

This study reviews the issues concerning PFASs exposure and potential risks generated with a focus on PFAS occurrence and transformation in various media, discusses their physicochemical characterization and treatment technologies, before discussing the potential human exposure routes. The various toxicological impacts to human health are also discussed. The article pays particular attention to the complexity and challenging issue of regulating PFAS compounds due to the arising uncertainty and lack of epidemiological evidence encountered. The variation in PFAS regulatory values across the globe can be easily addressed due to the influence of multiple scientific, technical, and social factors. The varied toxicology and the insufficient definition of PFAS exposure rate are among the main factors contributing to this discrepancy. The lack of proven standard approaches for examining PFAS in surface water, groundwater, wastewater, or solids adds more technical complexity. Although it is agreed that PFASs pose potential health risks in various media, the link between the extent of PFAS exposure and the significance of PFAS risk remain among the evolving research areas. There is a growing need to address the correlation between the frequency and the likelihood of human exposure to PFAS and the possible health risks encountered. Although USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) recommends the 70 ng/L lifetime health advisory in drinking water for both perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFO) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is similar to the Australian regulations, the German Ministry of Health proposed a health-based guidance of maximum of 300 ng/L for the combination of PFOA and PFOS. Moreover, there are significant discrepancies among the US states where the water guideline levels for the different states ranged from 13 to 1000 ng L−1 for PFOA and/or PFOS. The current review highlighted the significance of the future research required to fill in the knowledge gap in PFAS toxicology and to better understand this through real field data and long-term monitoring programs. © 2020 by the authors.

This review describes the general process by which these various agents are named, presents one general categorization by which these agents can be considered, and provides a concise table to which readers can refer to identify the proper name to use for each of the agents that has thus far been administered to humans.","contrast medium; echovist; ferric ammonium citrate; ferriselz; ferristene; ferumoxsil; gadobenate dimeglumine; gadobutrol; gadodiamide; gadolinium chloride; gadolinium pentetate; gadolinium pentetate meglumine; gadolinium zeolite; gadoteric acid; gadoteridol; gadoversetamide; gadoxetic acid; mangafodipir; manganese chloride; perfluorooctyl bromide; superparamagnetic iron oxide; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; unclassified drug; contrast enhancement; drug classification; drug formulation; nomenclature; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; review; Administration, Oral; Contrast Media; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Particle Size; Terminology"

For Staphylococcus aureus, recurring infections and a limited success of vaccines containing S. aureus antigens imply that native antigens induce immune responses insufficient for optimal efficacy. These perspectives exemplify the need to apply novel vaccine strategies to high-priority pathogens. One such approach can be termed convergent immunity, where antigens from non-target organisms that contain epitope homologs found in the target organism are applied in vaccines. This approach aims to evoke atypical immune defenses via synergistic processes that (1) afford protective efficacy; (2) target an epitope from one organism that contributes to protective immunity against another; (3) cross-protect against multiple pathogens occupying a common anatomic or immunological niche; and/or (4) overcome immune subversion or avoidance strategies of target pathogens. Thus, convergent immunity has a potential to promote protective efficacy not usually elicited by native antigens from a target pathogen. Variations of this concept have been mainstays in the history of viral and bacterial vaccine development. A more far-reaching example is the pre-clinical evidence that specific fungal antigens can induce cross-kingdom protection against bacterial pathogens. This trans-kingdom protection has been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies of the recombinant Candida albicans agglutinin-like sequence 3 protein (rAls3) where it was shown that a vaccine containing rAls3 provides homologous protection against C. albicans, heterologous protection against several other Candida species, and convergent protection against several strains of S. aureus. Convergent immunity reflects an intriguing new approach to designing and developing vaccine antigens and is considered here in the context of vaccines to target S. aureus. © 2014 Yeaman, Filler, Schmidt, Ibrahim, Edwards and Hennessey.",alpha hemolysin; alpha toxin; aphylococcus enterotoxin B; bacterial antigen; bacterial vaccine; collagen binding protein; complement component C3b; complement component C5a; complement component C5b; complement component C8; diphtheria toxoid CRM197; epitope; fungus antigen; gsk2392; Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine; live vaccine; Panton Valentine leukocidin; Pneumococcus vaccine; recombinant antigen; recombinant protein; Sa3ag; Sa4ag; Staphylococcus vaccine; stebvax; toxoid; unclassified drug; vaccine; virus vaccine; antigen recognition; bacteremia; bacterial colonization; Candida albicans; Clostridium tetani; convergent immunity; Corynebacterium diphtheriae; cross protection; hemodialysis; host resistance; human; humoral immunity; immunity; immunoregulation; immunotherapy; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; microbiome; Murinae; neutrophil; nonhuman; opportunistic infection; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); protein expression; protein processing; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; recurrent disease; regulatory T lymphocyte; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; Review; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; vaccination

Contaminant exposure is considered to be one of the largest threats to polar bears after the loss of their Arctic sea ice habitat due to climate change. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of current exposure, fate, and potential health effects of contaminants in polar bears from the circumpolar Arctic required by the Circumpolar Action Plan for polar bear conservation. Overall results suggest that legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), followed by other perfluoroalkyl compounds (e.g. carboxylic acids, PFCAs) and brominated flame retardants, are still the main compounds in polar bears. Concentrations of several legacy POPs that have been banned for decades in most parts of the world have generally declined in polar bears. Current spatial trends of contaminants vary widely between compounds and recent studies suggest increased concentrations of both POPs and PFCAs in certain subpopulations. Correlative field studies, supported by in vitro studies, suggest that contaminant exposure disrupts circulating levels of thyroid hormones and lipid metabolism, and alters neurochemistry in polar bears. Additionally, field and in vitro studies and risk assessments indicate the potential for adverse impacts to polar bear immune functions from exposure to certain contaminants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Biochemistry; Climate change; Contamination; Flame retardants; Hormones; Mammals; Mercury (metal); Risk assessment; Sea ice; Emerging compounds; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); PFAS; Pollutant; Ursus maritimus; Organic pollutants; carboxylic acid; chemical compound; chlordane; corticosteroid; flame retardant; mercury; organochlorine pesticide; perfluoroalkyl substance; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; sex hormone; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; bear; bioaccumulation; conservation planning; environmental fate; environmental impact assessment; flame retardant; health impact; knowledge; mercury (element); persistent organic pollutant; pollution exposure; population decline; Arctic; biochemical analysis; concentration (parameter); correlational study; energy metabolism; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental impact; epigenetics; genital system; health hazard; hematological parameters; histopathology; immune system; in vitro study; infectious agent; kidney; lipid metabolism; liver; neurochemistry; nonhuman; polar bear; pollutant; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; skeleton; species conservation; thyroid gland; trend study; animal; bear; environmental monitoring; physiology; pollutant; Arctic; Ursus maritimus; Animals; Arctic Regions; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Ursidae

Progressive NAFLD can develop into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or hepatocellular carcinoma. The current evidence proposes that environmental pollutants promote development and progression of NAFLD, and autophagy plays a vital role but is multifactorial affected in NAFLD. In this review, we analyzed on the regulations of common environmental pollutants on autophagy in NAFLD. To clarify the involved roles of autophagy, we discussed the dysregulation of autophagy by environmental pollutants in adipose tissue and gut, and their interactions with liver, as well as epigenetic regulation on autophagy by environmental pollutants.

In the future, tailored treatment methods are therefore of increasing significance for accurate removal of target pollutants in different water matrices. This critical review focuses on the overall strategies for accurately removing highly toxic emerging pollutants in the presence of typical interferents. The main difficulties hindering the improvement of selectivity in complex matrices are analyzed, implying that it is difficult to adopt a universal approach for multiple targets and water substrates. Selective methods based on assorted principles are proposed aiming to improve the anti-interference ability. Thus, typical approaches and fundamentals to achieve selectivity are subsequently summarized including their mechanism, superiority and inferior position, application scope, improvement method and the bottlenecks. The results show that different methods may be applicable to certain conditions and target pollutants. To better understand the mechanism of each selective method and further select the appropriate method, advanced methods for qualitative and quantitative characterization of selectivity are presented. The processes of adsorption, interaction, electron transfer, and bond breaking are discussed. Some comparable selective quantitative methods are helpful for promoting the development of related fields. The research framework of selectivity removal and its fundamentals are established. Presently, although continuous advances and remarkable achievements have been attained in the selective removal of characteristic organic pollutants, there are still various substantial challenges and opportunities. It is hopeful to inspire the researches on the new generation of water and wastewater treatment technology, which can selectively and preferentially treat characteristic pollutants, and establish a reliable research framework to lead the direction of environmental science. © 2022 American Chemical Society","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Environmental technology; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Accurate removal; Advanced treatment; Complex water matrix; Emerging pollutants; Interferents; Research frameworks; Selective mechanism; Target pollutants; Toxic organic pollutant; Water matrices; Organic pollutants; organic pollutant; organizational framework; toxic substance; acid base balance; chemical bond; electron transport; environmental science; molecular recognition; quantitative analysis; Review; static electricity; surface property; waste component removal; waste water management; water pollutant; adsorption; pollutant; wastewater; water management; water; Adsorption; Environmental Pollutants; Waste Water; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

These compounds are ubiquitously bioaccumulated in the environment and food chain for a long period due to their high chemical and biological stability. PFOS and PFOA are currently being transmitted via the aquatic medium, posing a concern not only to the aquatic ecosystem but also to human and animal health. Evidence of PFOS and PFOA-based toxicity has been associated with hepatoxicity, immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruptor, and cancer. PFOS and PFOA are primarly absorbed into the animal and human body through ingestion and bioaccumulate in the plasma, liver, and kidney. PFOS and PFOA are difficult to degrade, and as a result, they are frequently excreted in urine in their unchanged form. Methods for detecting PFOS and PFOA at trace levels in environmental and food matrices have been improved over time, resulting in their detection in a variety of environmental and food matrices. Nowadays, PFOS and PFOS have been identified as potential hazards and are included as novel persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Stockholm Convention, however their use in some countries such as Malaysia is unregulated. Although PFOS and PFOA have been widely explored in the environment and in food, and toxicological effects in some animals have been identified, human studies warrant further investigation. © 2021 UPM Press.

The Amplatzer® septal occluder (AGA Medical Co.) currently has the largest reported experience and subsequently the best-established safety and efficacy features. Clinically challenging situations, such as larger atrial septal defects, atrial septal defects with deficient rims and multiple atrial septal defects, are increasingly being addressed using the transcatheter approach, with improved results. The incidence of most complications has significantly reduced over time, and serious side effects are relatively uncommon.

They belong to the class of perfluoroalkyl substances, possessing properties such as high chemical stability, high mobility, high water solubility, extraordinary persistence in the environment, bioaccumulability in living tissues, and toxicity. Because of such properties, HFPO-DA and GenX are ubiquitously found in the environment, where they can remain almost unmutated for an extremely long time, so that such chemicals, together with the other perfluoroalkyl substances, are being named “forever chemicals”. Due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment, growing regulatory attention is paid to these pollutants. Parallelly, new technologies for their removal are highly necessary because conventional ones are almost ineffective. However, there is limited available information regarding the effectiveness of HFPO-DA and GenX treatment methods. The present article reviews the characteristics and occurrence of these emerging chemicals in the environment. Also, the removability of HFPO-DA and GenX by novel treatment approaches (membranes, adsorption, and degradation techniques) and conventional wastewater treatment are discussed.

The isomeric distribution of PFASs in the environment and source waters is largely controlled by the source of contamination and varying physicochemical properties imparted by their structural differences. For example, branched isomers of PFOS are relatively more reactive and less sorptive compared to the linear analogue. As a result, the removal of branched and linear PFASs during water treatment can vary, and thus the isomeric distribution in source waters can influence the overall efficiency of the treatment process. In this paper, we highlight the need to consider the isomeric distribution of PFASs in contaminated matrices while designing appropriate remediation strategies. We additionally summarize the known occurrence and variation in the physicochemical properties of PFAS isomers influencing their detection, fate, toxicokinetics, and treatment efficiency. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Classically, adolescent males develop initially progressive weakness followed by spontaneous stabilization within several years after onset. The pathogenesis of the disease is unclear and pathologic studies are lacking. However the prevailing theory postulates that insufficient growth of the dura relative to the spinal column during puberty allows forward displacement of the dura in flexion with compression of the spinal cord, possibly leading to ischemia of the anterior horn cells at C8 and Th1. Most reported cases have been from Asia, particularly Japan, though some have been reported from India, the Middle East, and Europe. To date, and to our knowledge, there has been no published study characterizing the MR imaging features of this disease in Bulgaria. Routine MR imaging of patients with HD has shown segmental cord atrophy, rarely associated with Th2 abnormalities. Previous studies of other cord diseases have shown, that the extent of cord tissue damage is usually underestimated by using routine MR imaging and that brain plasticity might limit the clinical consequences of cord injury.

NA,"Environmental chemicals, breast cancer progression and drug resistance",2020,NA,NA,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer in the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Mortality is associated mainly with the development of metastases. Identification of the mechanisms involved in metastasis formation is, therefore, a major public health issue. Among the proposed risk factors, chemical environment and pollution are increasingly suggested to have an effect on the signaling pathways involved in metastatic tumor cells emergence and progression. The purpose of this article is to summarize current knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals in breast cancer progression, metastasis formation and resistance to chemotherapy. Through a scoping review, we highlight the effects of a wide variety of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, on invasion mechanisms and metastatic processes in BC. We identified the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer-stemness (the stem cell-like phenotype in tumors), two mechanisms suspected of playing key roles in the development of metastases and linked to chemoresistance, as potential targets of contaminants. We discuss then the recently described pro-migratory and pro-invasive Ah receptor signaling pathway and conclude that his role in BC progression is still controversial. In conclusion, although several pertinent pathways for the effects of xenobiotics have been identified, the mechanisms of actions for multiple other molecules remain to be established. The integral role of xenobiotics in the exposome in BC needs to be further explored through additional relevant epidemiological studies that can be extended to molecular mechanisms. © 2020, The Author(s).",NA

Nafion the preferred membrane in VRFB systems has an overall cost of more than 11% in these systems. However, due to its drawbacks of high permeability and high cost limit its suitability for commercial use. Many researchers are therefore keen to develop new chemical designs for synthetic membranes, such as perfluorinated, partially fluorinated, hydrocarbon based and organic-inorganic composite membrane. The sol-gel process, which is mainly based on hydrolysis and condensation reaction offers the possibility of homogeneous preparation of membranes, leading to high proton conductivity and reduced vanadium ion permeability, thereby greatly increasing the cell efficiency.

Controlling die swell during extrusion is important in order to maintain good dimensional stability of the extrudate. Calendering is also a common problem, which associates blisters, and poor calender release. All raw elastomers and compounding ingredients are free of moisture and other volatiles in order to reduce blisters. Molding, porosity, shrinkage of cured parts, and backrinding also cause problems in a rubber factory. Pretreating the mold with Teflon coating is a method from which one can improve mold release in a rubber factory.

Excessive or inappropriate activation can result in tissue damage, classically illustrated in immune-mediated nephritis. In addition, complement forms a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, helping to prepare and focus T and B lymphocyte responses. More recent research in renal allograft models has shown that complement-inhibited and complement-deficient animals have reduced inflammatory injury and lowered antidonor immune responses. Furthermore, it is known that the transplanted kidney is a significant site of local synthesis of C3, although until recently the relative contribution of locally produced C3 to transplant injury was unknown. Current evidence indicates that defective local synthesis of C3 both reduces tissue injury and lowers the antidonor T cell response, substantially increasing graft survival. Among various possible explanations to account for these findings, the data favours a direct effect of complement on alloreactive T cell stimulation. Study of complement gene regulation by common immunosuppressive agents suggests that they do not influence local complement synthesis. Alternative approaches are therefore required to control the local effect of complement in the extravascular tissue compartment of the graft.",calcineurin inhibitor; complement; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C3c; complement component C4; complement component C5; complement component C5a; complement component C8; complement component C9; complement receptor; corticosteroid; cyclosporin; immunosuppressive agent; peptide fragment; tacrolimus; acute disease; animal; animal model; animal tissue; biosynthesis; complement system; gene expression regulation; graft rejection; human; human cell; immune response; immunology; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney allograft rejection; kidney graft rejection; kidney transplantation; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; organ transplantation; pathology; review; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; Acute Disease; Animals; Complement C3c; Complement C4; Complement System Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Graft Rejection; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Peptide Fragments; T-Lymphocytes

Immunomorphological changes characteristic of human thymic involution begin during or soon after the first year after birth, and continue progressively throughout the entire life span. The 3% to 5% annual reduction in the number of cells of the human thymic microenvironment continues until middle age, when it slows down to less than 1% per year. According to the extrapolation of these results, total loss of thymic reticulo-epithelial (RE) tissue and the associated thymocytes should occur at the age of 120 years in humans. The marked reduction of the thymic cellular microenvironment is a well-controlled physiological process and is presumably under both local and global regulation by the cells of the RE meshwork and by the neuroendocrine axis, respectively. In humans, the age related decline of facteur thymique serique (FTS) levels in blood begins after 20 years of age and FTS completely disappears between the 5th and 6th decade of life. In contrast, serum levels of thymosin-α1 and thymopoietin seem to decline earlier, starting as early as 10 years of age. The influences of a variety of other hormones on the involution of the thymus have also been characterized testosterone, estrogen, and hydrocortisone treatment results in marked involution, cortisone and progesterone administration have a slight to moderate effect while use of desoxycorticosterone has no effect. The experimental administration of thyroxin yielded dose dependent results: low doses resulted in thymic hypertrophy, higher doses produced a slight hypertrophy, while the highest employed doses caused thymic atrophy. The atrophy was of apicnotic type, very different from that detected after treatment with corticoid hormones. Thymus transplantation experiments indicate that age-related physiological thymic involution has been genetically preprogrammed. Grafting of the thymus from one week old C3H leukemic strain mice into 6 month old hosts resulted in changes in thymic weight and involution patterns that were synchronous in all recipients, in direct correlation with the glands in the donor, but not in the host. These data strongly suggest that the stimulus for thymus cell proliferation and differentiation is genetically determined within the organ implant. Since the thymus is the primary T-lymphopoietic organ during mammalian ontogenesis, its age-related involution with typical immunomorphological alterations can be held responsible only for the decline in antigen-specific T lymphocyte immune functions. Thymic involution and diminished T lymphocyte proliferation can be partially restored by thymic tissue transplantation or use of thymic hormones. The only partial reconstitution of CD4+ T helper lymphocyte subset after antineoplastic chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation represents a significant, therapy complicating clinical problem. After high-dose chemotherapy, restoration of thymus dependent CD4+ T lymphocyte genesis was reported only in children. Our radiation stem cell transplantation, and hormone treatment experiments in animals strongly suggest age and time dependent regeneration of the cytoarchitecture of the thymic cellular microenvironment, as well as intrathymic lymphopoiesis. The human body's zinc pool undergoes progressive reduction, resulting in low zinc plasma levels and a negative crude zinc balance in older rodents, as well as humans. Previous research suggests that the diminished bioavailability of zinc in older mammals may represent one of the major factors for the involution of the thymus and consequent cellular immunological dysfunction. In PBMCs, zinc induces several cytokines, predominantly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and, therefore, has an immense immunoregulative capacity. These effects are highly specific for the this element and neither biologically important bivalent ions like calcium or magnesium, nor structurally equivalent cations like nickel or cobalt can mimic these zinc-dependent effects. Cytokine induction by zinc is caused by a direct interaction between zinc with monocytes. By contrast, the stimulatory effect of zinc on T lymphocytes represents an indirect effect via monocyte-secreted IL-1 and direct cell to cell contact. Clinical symptoms of zinc deficiency include not only serious accidental thymic atrophy, but also a related high frequency of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Zinc treatment to improve nonspecific immunoregulation and its use as a non-toxic agent of immunosuppression has been suggested.",cortisone; cytokine; deoxycorticosterone; estrogen; hydrocortisone; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; progesterone; testosterone; thymopoietin; thymosin alpha1; thymus hormone; thyroxine; tumor necrosis factor alpha; zinc; animal tissue; bioavailability; bone marrow transplantation; cancer chemotherapy; cell density; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; dog; female; fetus; histogenesis; hormone blood level; human; human tissue; immunoregulation; involution; lifespan; lymphopoiesis; male; monocyte; mouse; nonhuman; ontogeny; reticuloendothelial system; review; stem cell transplantation; T lymphocyte; thymocyte; thymus; thymus atrophy; thymus transplantation; zinc deficiency

Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15).

Neurosteroids modulate several neurotransmitter systems such as γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and acetylcholine receptors. As physiologic consequences, they are involved in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory processes, aggression and epilepsy, and they modulate the responses to stress, anxiety and depression. The σ1-receptor protein was recently purified and its cDNA was cloned in several species. The amino-acid sequences are structurally unrelated to known mammalian proteins, but shared homology with a fungal sterol C8-C7 isomerase. The σ1-receptor ligands exert a potent neuromodulation on excitatory neurotransmitter systems, including the glutamate and cholinergic systems. Consequently, selective σ1 agonists show neuroprotective properties and beneficial effects in memory processes, stress and depression. The evidence of a direct interaction between neurosteroids and σ1-receptors was first suggested by the ability of several steroids to inhibit the binding of σ1-receptor radioligands in vitro and in vivo.

Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 μg/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at environmentally relevant concentrations.

The affinity of TBA for soil organic matter suggests prolonged contamination; degradation leads to the release of the metabolite desethylterbuthylazine (DET), which has higher water solubility and binds more weakly to organic matter compared to the parent compound, resulting in higher associated risk for contamination of groundwater resources. Additionally, TBA and DET are chemicals of emerging concern because of their persistence and toxicity towards aquatic organisms; moreover, they are known to have significant endocrine disruption capacity to wildlife and humans. Conventional treatments applied during drinking water production do not lead to the complete removal of these chemicals; activated carbon provides the greatest efficiency, whereas ozonation can generate by-products with comparable oestrogenic activity to atrazine. Hydrogen peroxide alone is ineffective to degrade TBA, while UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation and photocatalysis are the most effective processes for oxidation of TBA. It has been determined that direct photolysis gives the highest degradation efficiency of all UV/H2O2 treatments, while most of the photocatalytic degradation is attributed to OH radicals, and TiO2 solar-photocatalytic ozonation can lead to almost complete TBA removal in ∼30 min. Constructed wetlands provide a valuable buffer capacity, protecting downstream surface waters from contaminated runoff.

Recent Findings: The evolving knowledge of mechanisms of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis has recently been reviewed and characterized as ALD, NAFLD, and TAFLD. The most recent mechanistic studies on PFAS and PCBs have revealed a greater role for toxicants in the initiation of not only TAFLD but also NAFLD and the more progressive inflammatory stage of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In addition to insecticides, recent studies support a significant contribution of fungicides and herbicides to NAFLD. Summary: The mechanisms of PFAS, PCBs, and fungicides in contributing to the increased prevalence of NAFLD remain unclear. Addressing whether chronic, low-dose exposures could result in liver pathology and whether real-world exposure to mixtures of environmental contaminants pose a significant risk factor for NAFLD is paramount to understand the impact of NAFLD on populations today. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",pesticide; disease exacerbation; drug effect; human; liver; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pollutant; prevalence; risk factor; toxicity; Disease Progression; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Liver; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Pesticides; Prevalence; Risk Factors

These direct transformations provide new approaches in synthesis with high atom- and step-economy compared to the traditional catalytic cross-coupling reactions. However, such methods still suffer from several limitations including functional group tolerance and the lack of regioselectivity. In addition, they often require harsh reaction conditions and some of them need the use of strong oxidant, in a stoichiometric amount, avoiding these processes to be truly eco-friendly. The use of photoredox catalysis has contributed to a significant expansion of the scope of C(sp2)-H bond functionalizations which include the direct arylations, (perfluoro)alkylations, acylations, and even cyanations. Most of these transformations involve the photochemical induced generation of a radical followed by its regioselective addition to arenes, heteroarenes, or alkenes, leading to the building of a new C(sp2)-C bond. The use of photoredox catalysis plays crucial roles in these reactions promoting electron transfer, enabling the generation of radical species and single electron either oxidation or reduction. Such reactions operating at room temperature allow the building of C-C bonds with high chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity. This review surveys the formation of C(sp2)-C bonds initiated by photoredox catalysis which involves a C(sp2)-H bond functionalization step, describes the advantages compared to traditional C(sp2)-H bond functionalizations, and presents mechanistic insights into the role played by the photoredox catalysts. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",Aromatic compounds; Covalent bonds; Free radical reactions; Hydrocarbons; Regioselectivity; Transition metals; Cross coupling reactions; Electron transfer; Functionalizations; Intensive research; Photoredox catalysis; Radical species; Reaction conditions; Regioselective addition; Catalysis

Assembly of the C5b-9 complex initiates oligomerization of C9 and production of a transmembrane protein channel that inflicts damage to target cells. For protection, cells eliminate the MAC from their surface either by ectocytosis (direct emission of membrane vesicles) or by endocytosis (internalization). The process of ectosome release is rapid and involves cytosolic Ca2+ and activation of protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Recently, the involvement of mortalin (also known as GRP75 and mitochondrial hsp70) in MAC elimination has been suggested. Extracellular application of antibodies directed to mortalin increases cell sensitivity to MAC-mediated lysis. Release of membrane vesicles is ubiquitous and enhanced in apoptotic or tumor cells and upon cell activation. Composition of the ectosomes (also often referred to as microparticles) membrane proteins and lipids appears to be different from those of the original plasma membrane, indicating involvement of a selective sorting process during ectosome formation. Exosomes (unlike ectosomes) are membrane vesicles generated by endocytosis, endosome sorting into perinuclear multivesicular bodies (MVB) and exocytosis of MVBs. Exosomes appear to be different in size and composition from ectosomes. Exosome-associated MAC has also been described. Although research on ectosomes and exosomes is still limited, physiological roles in coagulation, vascular functions, angiogenesis, wound healing and development have been attributed to these shed membrane vesicles. On the other hand, there are indications that elevated levels of ectosomes and exosomes may predispose to morbidity. Membrane vesicles released by cells exposed to complement MAC may play roles in health and disease beyond protection from cell death. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","antibody; calcium ion; complement; complement membrane attack complex; heat shock protein 70; lipid; membrane protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; protein kinase; protein kinase C; angiogenesis; blood clotting; cancer; cell activation; cell death; cell membrane; cell protection; endocytosis; enzyme activation; exocytosis; human; immunity; membrane vesicle; morbidity; nonhuman; oligomerization; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; review; tumor cell; wound healing; Animals; Apoptosis; Complement Membrane Attack Complex; Complement System Proteins; Exocytosis; Humans; Models, Immunological; Neoplasms; Transport Vesicles"

Due to their unique enhanced solubility for oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2), PFCs have been used in research as enhanced gas transport media for situations wherein the microcirculation is dysfunctional. In the early 1990s a PFC emulsion was approved for human use during coronary artery angioplasty and one is presently in use in Russia as well as other countries. The pharmaceutical class has had reported in the past associated with variable amounts of time-limited thrombocytopenia. Anxiety about cerebral embolism surfaced after a pivotal phase III trial leading to the cessation of all human research in the United States. At that time papers both published and submitted to the FDA opined (without proof) that the platelet count decrease might be caused by platelet white cell conjugates and/or platelet aggregates, thereby signaling a general inflammatory response to PFCs and a potential thrombosis risk. Although thrombocytopenia has been reported in response to PFC emulsion formulations, it is not ubiquitous and seems to be less associated with some formulations. As well, in some recent animal studies there is no evidence of platelet white cell adverse interactions. The mechanism for the reported thrombocytopenia is as yet not fully understood, and risk-benefit profiles will have to be carefully studied as contemporary human trials move forward. © 2019 by the Shock Society.",emulsifying agent; fluorocarbon; lipid; fluorocarbon; emulsion; human; inflammation; platelet count; Review; animal; chemistry; emulsion; inflammation; metabolism; platelet count; Animals; Emulsions; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Inflammation; Platelet Count

Nowhere is this more evident than in chloroplasts - the O2-evolving photosynthetic organelles of plant cells that are fitted with multiple redox systems, including the thioredoxin (Trx) family of oxidoreductases functional in the reversible modification of regulatory thiols of proteins in all types of cells. The best understood member of this family in chloroplasts is the ferredoxin-linked thioredoxin system (FTS) by which proteins are modified via light-dependent disulfide/dithiol (S-S/2SH) transitions. Recent Advances: Discovered in the reductive activation of enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle in illuminated chloroplast preparations, recent studies have extended the role of the FTS far beyond its original boundaries to include a spectrum of cellular processes. Together with the NADP-linked thioredoxin reductase C-type (NTRC) and glutathione/glutaredoxin systems, the FTS also plays a central role in the response of chloroplasts to different types of stress. Critical Issues: The comparisons of redox regulatory networks functional in chloroplasts of land plants with those of cyanobacteria - prokaryotes considered to be the ancestors of chloroplasts - and different types of algae summarized in this review have provided new insight into the evolutionary development of redox regulation, starting with the simplest O2-evolving organisms. Future Directions: The evolutionary appearance, mode of action, and specificity of the redox regulatory systems functional in chloroplasts, as well as the types of redox modification operating under diverse environmental conditions stand out as areas for future study. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.","alteplase; carbon dioxide; cysteine; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; glutaredoxin; glutathione; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; phosphoribulokinase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; rubisco activase; thiol; thioredoxin; thioredoxin reductase; unclassified drug; ferredoxin; thioredoxin; chloroplast; cyanobacterium; Embryophyta; enzyme activation; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; photosynthesis; plant evolution; Review; chloroplast; classification; genetics; metabolism; molecular evolution; oxidation reduction reaction; plant; Chloroplasts; Evolution, Molecular; Ferredoxins; Oxidation-Reduction; Plants; Thioredoxins"
NA,Persistent organic pollutants and obesity: are they potential mechanisms for breast cancer promotion?,2015,NA,NA,"Dietary ingestion of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is correlated with the development of obesity. Obesity alters metabolism, induces an inflammatory tissue microenvironment, and is also linked to diabetes and breast cancer risk/promotion of the disease. However, no direct evidence exists with regard to the correlation among all three of these factors ( POPs, obesity, and breast cancer). Herein, we present results from current correlative studies indicating a causal link between POP exposure through diet and their bioaccumulation in adipose tissue that promotes the development of obesity and ultimately influences breast cancer development and/or progression. Furthermore, as endocrine disruptors, POPs could interfere with hormonally responsive tissue functions causing dysregulation of hormone signaling and cell function. This review highlights the critical need for advanced in vitro and in vivo model systems to elucidate the complex relationship among obesity, POPs, and breast cancer, and, more importantly, to delineate their multifaceted molecular, cellular, and biochemical mechanisms. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies directly testing the observed correlations as well as detailing their molecular mechanisms are vital to cancer research and, ultimately, public health.",NA

Several federal departments are involved in different aspects of this work. Significant PFAS work is carried out under the Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan (FCSAP), which provides a structure for the dozens of departments that are implicated in federal contaminated sites management in Canada. The work carried out under FCSAP is largely related to the PFAS resulting from aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) use. The Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) is another program with significant involvement in the assessment and management of certain PFAS. This work includes the publication of screening assessments on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (LC-PFCAs) which led to their regulation. Risk assessments identify whether a chemical substance poses a risk, and if so, risk managers determine how best to minimise or eliminate the risk to protect the public and the environment. Highlights of work carried out under FCSAP, CMP, and existing regulations are discussed herein. Environmental quality guidelines and drinking water quality guidelines provide benchmarks for the quality of the ambient environment. Canadian federal guidelines or screening values to protect human health are now available for eleven (11) PFAS, while values to protect ecological receptors are available for PFOS. Development of our understanding, including the review of new information on PFAS (those for which guidelines exist and additional substances) is ongoing. Ongoing scientific research and risk management at contaminated sites in Canada have also been part of efforts by multiple federal departments in Canada.

A variety of synthetic approaches has been employed in late-stage difluoroalkylation reactions. Visible light photoredox catalysis for the production of CF 2 FG and CF 2 H radicals has provided a more sustainable alternative to other conventional radical-triggered reactions from the viewpoint of safety, cost, availability, and “green” chemistry. A wide range of difluoroalkylating reagents has been successfully implemented in these organic transformations in the presence of transition metal complexes or organic photocatalysts. In most cases, upon excitation via visible light irradiation with fluorescent light bulbs or blue light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, these photocatalysts can act as both reductive and oxidative quenchers, thus enabling the application of electron-donor or electron-acceptor difluoroalkylating reagents for the generation of CF 2 FG and CF 2 H radicals. Subsequent radical addition to substrates and additional organic transformations afford the corresponding difluoroalkylated derivatives.

Such surfaces are often compared to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which exhibits a low surface energy, accompanied by biological and chemical inertness, making perfluorinated interfaces applicable to a wide range of technologies. In thin-film research, self-assembled monolayers derived from fluorinated alkanethiols (FSAMs) serve as well-defined systems that can be used to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of interfaces produced with varying degrees of fluorination. The characteristics of these surfaces have been attributed to both the chemical composition of the individual molecular adsorbates and the consequent structural features associated with monolayers formed from these unique partially fluorinated adsorbates. Specifically, this review seeks to correlate the structural and interfacial properties of FSAMs on gold with the structure/composition of the fluorinated moiety present in the adsorbed molecules and to highlight how the degree of fluorination influences the interfacial ordering of the individual alkanethiolate chains and the vacuum energy levels of the modified metal substrate. Additionally, the thermal stability of these organic thin films is analyzed as a function of adsorbate structure. Included are highlights of some of the studies in which FSAMs, formed from a variety of new types of surfactants, were used to modify colloidal systems, to generate anti-adhesive materials, and to enhance the stability of fluorinated thin films toward low-energy electron degradation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",Adsorbates; Electrons; Fluorination; Fluorine; Organic polymers; Self assembled monolayers; Surfaces; Thin films; Adsorbate structures; Chemical compositions; Low energy electrons; Partially fluorinated; Physical and chemical properties; Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); Self-assembled monolayer films; Structure and properties; Halogenation

Evidence indicates that the interplaying inflammatory reactions are augmented by reperfusion and that accumulating PMNs can contribute to myocardial damage, eg, by release of oxygen-derived free radicals, proteases, and leukotrienes. In experimental models, interventions aimed at PMN inhibition can exert cardioprotective effects, and some of these strategies raise hope for future clinical applications. A greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in PMN-mediated myocardial damage is necessary for designing a rational approach to reduce the putative detrimental effects of PMNs without antagonizing their favorable consequences in tissue healing.",3 amino 1 (3 trifluoromethylphenyl) 2 pyrazoline; 5 amino 4 imidazolecarboxamide riboside; adenosine; antioxidant; arachidonic acid derivative; arginine; cell adhesion molecule; chemokine; chemotactic factor; complement; cytokine; fluosol; granulocyte antibody; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; leukotriene; lipoxygenase inhibitor; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody 904; monoclonal antibody ib4; monoclonal antibody r15 7; nitric oxide; oxygen radical; pentoxifylline; perfluoro compound; prostaglandin E1; prostaglandin synthase inhibitor; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; thrombocyte activating factor; thromboxane A2; unclassified drug; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiotoxicity; complement activation; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; heart protection; human; ischemic heart disease; leukocyte adherence; leukocyte function; neutrophil chemotaxis; priority journal; review
NA,Metabolic syndrome and endocrine disrupting chemicals: An overview of exposure and health effects,2021,NA,NA,"Increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is causing a significant health burden among the European population. Current knowledge supports the notion that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with human metabolism and hormonal balance, contributing to the conventionally recognized lifestyle-related MetS risk factors. This review aims to identify epidemiological studies focusing on the association between MetS or its individual components (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension) and eight HBM4EU priority substances (bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides and heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic and mercury)). Thus far, human biomonitoring (HBM) studies have presented evidence supporting the role of EDC exposures on the development of individual MetS components. The strength of the association varies between the components and EDCs. Current evidence on metabolic disturbances and EDCs is still limited and heterogeneous, and mainly represent studies from North America and Asia, highlighting the need for well-conducted and harmonized HBM programmes among the European population. Rigorous and ongoing HBM in combination with health monitoring can help to identify the most concerning EDC exposures, to guide future risk assessment and policy actions. © 2021 by the authors.

R FI is a versatile synthetic reagent widely utilized to introduce the perfluoroalkyl functionality and its unique functional characteristics into organic substances. Two distinct analysis tools were employed. First, Reaxys ® was employed to examine the versatility and occurrences of R FI in 1356 non-polymeric synthetic transformations. The most common R FI synthetic conversions were (i) free-radical addition to carbon-carbon double or triple bonds, (ii) coupling to aryl halides, and (iii) Grignard, organolithium, or similar R F anion addition to ketones and aldehydes. R FI were also used as a chain transfer reagent in free-radical polymerization reactions of fluorinated and other unsaturated monomers. Second, a complementary Chemical Abstracts' STN AnaVist ® search was employed to summarize the 779 publications describing reaction products that contained n-perfluoroalkyl chains (C nF 2n+1-, where n = 2-4). The most common uses for materials into which R FI was incorporated were surfactants, pesticides, electronic materials, pharmaceuticals, liquid crystals, dyes and optical materials, battery electrolytes, repellents, lubricants and polymerization catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer materials remain the technological membrane of choice for PEMFCs because of their robustness, versatility of use, and widespread commercial availability. PFSAs, however, are far from ideal: they are prepared from fluorine-based chemicals that are under increasing environmental scrutiny, they are inherently expensive to prepare and dispose of, their ionic conductivity is limited, and they are highly permeable to gases. Numerous classes of ion-containing polymers have been investigated as potential replacements over the past decades, but PFSA remains the incumbent technology because hydrocarbon-based solid polymer electrolyte membranes are perceived to lack the oxidative stability of their fluorine-containing counterparts. A new era of hydrocarbon PEM research has recently emerged with an emphasis on the hydrocarbon membrane's inherent lower gas permeability and unanticipated stability in fuel cell applications. Of the various classes of polymer derivatives that hold promise, sulfonated polyphenylenes, devoid of heteroatom linkages in the main chain, are leading candidates. The absence of heteroatom linkages in the polymer backbone is not without penalty: their synthesis is challenging and processing restricted due to their rigid-rod character, coupled with the requirement to attach acid bearing groups in high concentration. This review focuses exclusively on the evolution of sulfonated polyphenylenes, from intractable rigid rods to architecturally-controlled, sterically-encumbered sulfo-phenylated polyphenylenes, with an emphasis on synthesis, precise molecular control, structure-property relationships, and ultimately, wide-scale adoption in fuel cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA
Fournier E.,Simplified exploration of brachial plexopathies by reduction to well-known mononeuropathies and radiculopathies [Exploration simplifiée des atteintes plexiques par réduction aux atteintes nerveuses et radiculaires connues],2009,10.1016/j.neurol.2009.07.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71349086238&doi=10.1016%2fj.neurol.2009.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=a17074870dd3c714c8b7b114e0138638,"The anatomic complexity of the brachial plexus makes its electrophysiological exploration difficult. Electrodiagnosis nevertheless plays a crucial role in assessing brachial plexopathies, particularly in the perspective of post-traumatic surgical reconstructions. The evaluation aims to locate as precisely as possible injuries within the plexus, as well as to determine their severity and capacity for recovery. This requires various sensory nerve conduction studies and needle EMG recordings of ""marker"" muscles. Plexopathies differ from radiculopathies by altered sensory nerve responses and unaltered functional innervation of paracervical muscles. We propose to simplify the exploration of brachial plexopathies by following some practical rules derived from a reanalysis of the brachial plexus anatomic sketch. Two main simplification rules can be deduced from an analysis of the anatomic sketch. First it would be judicious to associate the plexopathies involving a single element of the brachial plexus with distinct etiological and symptomatic patterns according to the altered element, as one does for peripheral nerve and root pathologies. The second proposal relies on the observation that each supraclavicular ""truncal"" element (upper, middle, or lower) of the brachial plexus results from reunion of cervical root nerves and behaves like a ""super-root"" for the upper limb, while each infraclavicular ""cord"" element (posterior, lateral, or medial) is the sum of two or more peripheral nerves and behaves like a ""super-nerve"". Accordingly, the motor and sensory abnormalities associated with the lesion of a single plexus branch may occupy a clinical and electrophysiological territory that recovers those of its constituants. Except the unaltered paracervical muscles, it is useful to reduce the topographical semiology of truncal lesions to well-known cervical radiculopathies (upper trunk neuropathy to C5 and C6 associated radiculopathies, middle trunk neuropathy to C7 radiculopathy, lower trunk neuropathy to C8 and T1 associated radiculopathies); and that of cord lesions to well-known mononeuropathies of the upper limb (for example, a posterior cord neuropathy may be considered as a full radial mononeuropathy associated with an axillary one). This method of simplification allows to demystify the brachial plexopathies and to facilitate their comprehension and exploration. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To increase awareness of this relationship in environmental epidemiology, we reviewed the available epidemiologic data on menstrual bleeding and PFAS concentrations. Recent Findings: Initial epidemiologic studies reported generally higher PFAS concentrations in men, menopausal women, and those with a history of hysterectomy compared to premenopausal women. Although subsequent studies investigating menstrual cycle characteristics observed somewhat discrepant results for menstrual irregularity and cycle length, consistent associations have been observed between heavy menstrual bleeding and lower PFAS concentrations. Summary: This review highlights the important role of menstrual bleeding on the excretion of PFAS. Given the high prevalence of menstrual bleeding in the population and the implications for environmental epidemiology, we provide recommendations to move this field forward. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",fluorocarbon; female; human; pollutant; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans

Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure- health effect relationships. The ""exposome"" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. Objectives: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the ""early-life exposome."" Here we describe the general design of the project. Methods: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. Conclusions: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, it will form an important first step toward the life-course exposome.","4, 4' isopropylidenediphenol; biological marker; hexachlorobenzene; lead; mercury; nitrogen dioxide; organophosphate pesticide; oxybenzone; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; phthalic acid bis (2 ethylhexyl) ester; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; proteome; tobacco smoke; transcriptome; triclosan; unclassified drug; biological marker; proteome; transcriptome; adult; air pollutant; child; child growth; child health; construction work and architectural phenomena; DNA methylation; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epigenetics; female; fetus growth; food contamination; human; human early life exposure; knowledge; maternal care; metabolome; mobile application; nerve cell differentiation; noise; obesity; physical activity; physical mobility; prenatal exposure; preschool child; priority journal; public health; questionnaire; review; school child; self monitoring; study design; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; water contamination; child development; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; Europe; fetus development; infant; male; newborn; pregnancy; Biological Markers; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Epigenomics; Europe; Female; Fetal Development; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; Metabolome; Obesity; Pregnancy; Proteome; Transcriptome"

PFAAs are hormone-disrupting compounds that are strongly suspected to affect mother-child-health such as fetal growth. Thyroid disruption is a plausible mechanism of action. We aim to summarize the epidemiological evidence for the relation between prenatal and postnatal exposure to PFAAs and disruption of thyroid homeostasis in mothers and/or infants. Method: Fifteen original publications on PFAAs concentrations and thyroid hormones (TH) in pregnant women and/or infants were found upon a literature search in the PubMed database. Information on exposure to seven PFAAs congeners [Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA)] and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free and total thyroxine (FT4 and TT4), free and total triiodothyronine (FT3 and TT3), T3RU (Free triiodothyronine resin uptake) and FT4-index (FT4I) levels were recorded. We evaluated sampling of maternal TH by trimester, and infant TH by sex stratification. Reported associations between mother or infant PFAAs and TH were not uniformly assessed in the selected studies. Results: Ten out of the fifteen studies examined maternal PFAAs concentration and TSH level. Seven studies showed significant associations between TSH and exposure to six PFAAs congeners, most of them were positive. Maternal T4 and T3 were investigated in nine studies and five studies found inverse associations between exposure to six PFAAs congeners and TH (TT3, TT4, FT3, FT4 and FT4I) levels. Eight of the fifteen studies investigated PFAAs concentrations and infant TSH. Infant TSH level was significantly affected in four studies, positively in three studies. Nine studies investigated infant T4 and T3 and seven studies found significant associations with PFAAs exposure. However, both inverse and positive significant associations with infant TH were found eliciting no clear direction. Conclusion: Results indicate a mainly positive relationship between maternal PFAAs concentrations and TSH levels, and suggestion of an inverse association with T4 and/or T3 levels. Associations of infant TH with PFAAs concentration were less consistent. © 2020, The Author(s).",fluorine derivative; liothyronine; perflouroalkyl acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; decanoic acid derivative; fluorocarbon; thyroid hormone; chemical compound; concentration (composition); detection method; epidemiology; homeostasis; hormone; literature review; resin; clinical outcome; concentration (parameter); controlled study; female; fetus; homeostasis; hormone determination; human; hypothyroidism; maternal exposure; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; Review; thyroid gland; blood; environmental exposure; fetomaternal transfusion; mother; pollutant; pregnancy; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; Decanoic Acids; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fetus; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Mothers; Pregnancy; Thyroid Hormones

Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective ‘tagging’, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of ‘drug-like’ properties.

However, the drugs available to treat aggression are non-specific and can have unwanted side effects. The zebrafish is an ideal model for behavioural pharmacology. They are small, aggression can be measured reliably, and drugs can be applied by immersion in the tank water. The ability to visualise and manipulate circuits in the intact brain represents an excellent opportunity to understand how chemical compounds modify the signalling pathways that control this behaviour. This review discusses protocols to measure zebrafish aggression, the neural circuits that control this behaviour and how pharmacological studies can inform us about environmental toxicology and the development of therapeutic drugs for humans.

GQDs exhibit the phenomena of quantum confinement and edge effects; this phenomenon bestows them with exceptional physico-chemical properties. These features have made GQDs suitable materials for application in the catalytic removal of organic pollutants and dyes, adsorption of heavy metals, filtration of organic pollutants and in the disinfection of microbes. However, challenges encountered when developing GQDs for environmental applications include generating high-quality QDs and devising large scale synthetic procedures that ensure reproducible size distribution. A need exists for theoretical and practical research on the development of novel methods that allows high yields and easy purification of GQDs to be achieved. In addition, despite possible mechanisms having been proposed, a lack of an understanding of the photoluminescence (PL) properties of GQDs remains. This review focuses on some of the research that was reported on GQDs during in the past 20 years. The significant findings are summarized with comparative and balanced views. The emphasis is placed on the different synthetic routes for accessing GQDs and as well as the unique properties, which make GQDs ideal candidates for the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater. An evaluation of the most used approaches and promising technologies for the removal of emerging pollutants using GQDs is also presented. Further, current challenges relating to the use of GQDs are addressed and an outlook of GQDs as well as recommendations for future work are presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",NA

Human epidemiological studies are sparse. The aim was to investigate the association between pregnancy serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and offspring behaviour and motor development at 5-9 years of age. Methods: Maternal sera from the INUENDO cohort (2002-2004) comprising 1,106 mother-child pairs from Greenland, Kharkiv (Ukraine) and Warsaw (Poland) were analysed for PFOS and PFOA, using liquid-chromatographytandem- mass-spectrometry. Exposures were grouped into country specific as well as pooled tertiles as well as being used as continuous variables for statistical analyses. Child motor development and behaviour at follow-up (2010-2012) were measured by the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ) and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were analysed by multiple logistic and linear regression analyses. Results: In the pooled analysis, odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for hyperactivity was 3.1 (1.3, 7.2) comparing children prenatally exposed to the highest PFOA tertile with those exposed to the lowest PFOA tertile. Comparing children in the highest PFOS tertile with those in the lowest PFOS tertile showed elevated but statistically non-significant OR of hyperactivity (OR (95% CI) 1.7 (0.9, 3.2)). In Greenland, elevated PFOS was associated with higher SDQ-total scores indicating more behavioural problems (β (95% CI) =1.0 (0.1, 2.0)) and elevated PFOA was associated with higher hyperactivity sub-scale scores indicating more hyperactive behaviour (β (95% CI) = 0.5 (0.1, 0.9)). Prenatal PFOS and PFOA exposures were not associated with motor difficulties. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA may have a small to moderate effect on children's neuro-behavioural development, specifically in terms of hyperactive behaviour. The associations were strongest in Greenland where exposure contrast is largest. © 2015 Høyer et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","perfluorinated alkyl substance; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; age class; behavioral response; child development; cohort analysis; concentration (composition); mental health; organofluorine; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pregnancy; serum; spatiotemporal analysis; adult; blood analysis; child; child behavior; child development; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire; female; follow up; gestational age; Greenland; human; hyperactivity; infant; liquid chromatography; male; maternal blood; motor development; motor dysfunction; nervous system development; outcome assessment; prenatal exposure; priority journal; progeny; prospective study; questionnaire; Review; Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; tandem mass spectrometry; adverse effects; blood; chemically induced; drug effects; epidemiology; maternal exposure; motor activity; Poland; pregnancy; preschool child; Ukraine; Arctic; Charkov; Greenland; Mazowieckie; Poland [Central Europe]; Ukraine; Warsaw [Mazowieckie]; Animalia; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Caprylates; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Chromatography, Liquid; Female; Fluorocarbons; Greenland; Humans; Male; Maternal Exposure; Motor Activity; Poland; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Prospective Studies; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Ukraine"

The biological, physical or chemical hybrid technologies to treat EPs results interesting since they can enhance the performance of WWTPs. Among them, hybrid adsorption/biological technology could offer different possibilities that are explored in this work (PAC-MBR, PACT/GAC-CAS, BAC configurations). In this way, different variations in the adsorption process have been considered: the form of the adsorbent, the feed to the system, and the type of biological process, either conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactor (MBR) or biofilm systems. For each combination, the removal efficiency of micropollutants, classified according to their use into pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PCPs) and other micropollutants (mainly benzotriazoles) was analysed. From reported data, it was observed a beneficial synergistic effect of dipole moment and octanol–water partition coefficient on the removal efficiency of micropollutants by adsorption/biological hybrid technology. Finally, a preliminary economic evaluation of the powdered activated carbon in a conventional activated sludge reactor (PACT), powdered activated carbon-membrane bioreactor (PAC-MBR) and biological activated carbon (BAC) hybrid systems was carried out by analysing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of plants for capacities up to 75,000 m3d−1. Likewise, estimations of adsorbent concentration for a hypothetical plant with a capacity of 10,000 m3d−1 is presented. Among these hybrid configurations, PAC-MBR achieved the highest micropollutant elimination percentages; however, it presents the highest CAPEX and activated carbon requirements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Activated sludge process; Adsorption; Bioconversion; Biological water treatment; Costs; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Hybrid systems; Pollution; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Activated carbon membranes; Activated sludge; Conventional activated sludges; Economics evaluations; Emerging pollutants; Hybrid technology; Micropollutants; Physical-biological hybrid technology; Powdered activated carbon; Waste water treatment plants; Bioreactors; activated carbon; benzotriazole derivative; activated carbon; activated sludge; bioreactor; chemical pollutant; membrane; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; PPCP; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; adsorption; biodegradation; biofilm; biological hybrid; chemical analysis; chemical structure; conventional activated sludge; economic evaluation; heavy metal removal; hybrid; physical chemistry; pollutant; priority journal; reduction kinetics; Review; adsorption; bioreactor; cost benefit analysis; ecosystem; human; sewage; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Bioreactors; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification"

A systematic review,2018,10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040919467&doi=10.1186%2fs13750-017-0114-y&partnerID=40&md5=d47465c8184659b9ddded08a37af52fd,"Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9-14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe. © 2018 The Author(s).",NA

By contrast, man-made fluorine-containing derivatives of all major classes of biologically important compounds are extremely promising medicinal targets used in the elucidation of biochemical, metabolic transformations and the development of new pharmaceuticals. Among the fluorine-containing derivatives of natural products, fluorinated analogs of amino acids are of particular interest and medicinal potential. This article presents a concise review of various synthetic methods, developed by the Kievs school of bioorganic chemistry, for the preparation of fluorine-containing analogs of α- and β-amino acids, α-hydroxy acids, amines, as well as their phosphorus and sulfur-derived compounds, in enantiomerically pure form. One of the major methodological goals of the study was practicality, which is understood by us as stereochemical generality, operational convenience and synthetic affordance for each reaction step and isolation of the target products. The synthetic methods developed by our group can be roughly divided in two general categories: fluorine-adaptation of known synthetic approaches and discovery of new reactions. The former approach is most prominently represented by asymmetric homologation of nucleophilic glycine equivalents using fluorinated substrates via alkyl halide alkylations, aldol and Michael addition reactions. A plethora of discovered unexpected reaction outcomes, in particular stereochemical, are emphasized in this review and the particular role of fluorine, in altering the 'normal reaction result, is explained. The latter direction is notably represented by the novel 1,3-proton shift reaction, a biomimetic reductive amination of fluorinated carbonyl compounds to the corresponding amines and amino acids, as well as the development of α-fluoroalkyl epoxides as true fluorinated synthons for generalized asymmetric synthesis of various biologically relevant compounds. Despite the highly anticipated potential of fluorine-containing amino compounds, their medicinal chemistry still remains underexplored. The major obstacle, in our opinion, is that these selectively fluorinated compounds are generally unavailable to the medicinal chemists for comprehensive, systematic study. We hope this review of synthetic methods will highlight and bring attention to particular types of fluorinated amino acids and related compounds readily available on a laboratory scale using methods developed by our group. © 2009 Future Science Ltd.","2 hydroxyacid; acetic acid derivative; alpha amino acid; amine; amino acid; aminoalcohol; beta amino acid; beta,beta,beta (trifluoro)alanine; carbonyl derivative; epoxide; fluorine; isocyanoacetic acid derivative; nickel complex; phosphorus derivative; pyruvic acid derivative; sulfur derivative; trifluoropyruvic acid; unclassified drug; aldol reaction; alkylation; catalysis; drug structure; drug synthesis; enantiomer; fluorination; Michael addition; priority journal; review; stereochemistry; Ukraine; Amino Acids; Biological Products; Fluorine; Halogenation; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Stereoisomerism"

The PBDs exert their biological activity through covalent binding and exhibit cytotoxicity. Extensive studies have been carried out on the synthetic strategies of PBDs, and a sound understanding of structure activity relationships within this class of compounds has been developed. The PBDs have shown to interfere with the interaction of endonuclease enzymes of DNA and block the transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase in a sequence specific manner. These processes have been thought to account for the biological activity of PBDs. The PBDs have also been used as a scaffold to attach different type of moieties leading to novel sequence selective DNA cleaving and cross-linking agents. The design and synthesis of C8-linked PBD dimers and other hybrids of PBDs has given a new insight towards the development of molecules with enhanced DNA binding affinity and sequence specificity compared to the naturally occurring PBDs. This improvement in the biological profile has been explained on the basis of certain factors like DNA cross-linking and doubling of DNA binding sites. There seems to be enough potential for further changing the substitution pattern and to design structurally modified PBDs by retaining the PBD core intact. In this review both the synthetic strategies and the structure-activity relationships, particularly the DNA binding and cytotoxicity studies of PBDs have been discussed.","1,2,3,11a tetrahydro 8 hydroxy 7 methoxy 5h pyrrolo[2,1 c][1,4]benzodiazepin 5 one; amide; amonafide; anthramycin; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic antibiotic; benzodiazepine derivative; chicamycin a; cisplatin; dilactam; dimer; distamycin A derivative; DNA topoisomerase; double stranded DNA; dsb 120; endonuclease; gyrase inhibitor; imine; lexitropsin; methanolamine; mitonafide; neothramycin A; neothramycin B; oxazolo[2,3 c][1,4]benzodiazepine derivative; pyrrolo[2,1 c][1,4]benzodiazepine derivative; RNA polymerase; sibiromycin; sjg 136; tomaymycin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antineoplastic activity; binding affinity; binding site; controlled study; covalent bond; cytotoxicity; DNA cleavage; DNA cross linking; DNA sequence; DNA transcription; drug binding; drug design; drug DNA binding; drug inhibition; drug isolation; drug potency; drug synthesis; human; human cell; hybrid; review; sequence analysis; Streptomyces; structure activity relation; Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Benzodiazepines; DNA, Neoplasm; Drug Design; Humans; Indicators and Reagents; Prodrugs; Pyrroles; Structure-Activity Relationship"
NA,Serum perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and birthweight: an updated meta-analysis with bias analysis.,2018,NA,NA,"Background: A recent meta-analysis of 15 studies found a change in birthweight of −12.8 g (95% CI = −23.1, −2.38) per ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood and −27.1 g (−50.6, −3.6) per log ng/ml PFOA. Almost all studies were done in low-exposed populations. There are nine new studies, adding 6,019 births to the previous 6,937 births. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 studies. To combine all results, we approximated results for untransformed PFOA from nine studies using log-transformed PFOA. We also included another large study, excluded from previous analyses, in a sensitivity analysis. Results: We found a change of birthweight of −10.5 g (−16.7, −4.4) for every ng/ml PFOA in maternal or cord blood. After adding one previously excluded large study, we found little evidence of an association (−1.0 g; 95% CI = −2.4, 0.4). Restricting to studies where blood was sampled from mothers early in the pregnancy or shortly before conception (5,393 births), we found little association of PFOA with birthweight (−3.3 g [−9.6, 3.0]). In studies where blood was sampled late in the pregnancy (7563 pregnancies), lower birthweight was associated with higher PFOA (−17.8 [−25.0, −10.6]). Conclusion: Present human evidence provides only modest support for decreased birthweight with increasing PFOA. Studies with a wide range of exposure, and studies with blood sampled early in pregnancy, showed little or no association of PFOA with birthweight. These are studies in which confounding and reverse causality would be of less concern. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",NA

During the second part of 1946 he was employed in PLIVA, Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company in Zagreb, in the Department of Chemotherapeutical Drugs Production. For two years he worked on the production of neoarsphenamine and on the synthesis and tuberculostatic activity of pyrrol-azo-phenylarsonic acids and pyrrol-azo-benzoic acid. By means of toxicological and spectroscopic methods he proved, with Nikola Muić, the existence of cis-trans isomers of 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-dihydroxyarsenobenzene. In 1950 he worked as a member of ""Foreign Student Summer Project"" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass, on the synthesis of β-carotene in the laboratory of Professor Nicholas A. Milas. During the academic year 1952/53 he continued the work on the synthesis of polyenes in MIT, Cambridge. He obtained his Ph. D. degree under the supervision of Professor Krešimir Balenović in 1952, with whom he worked on the stereochemistry of sulfur containing β-amino acids: L-β-methionine, L-β-cystine and L-β-homodjenkolic acid, and several dipeptides and tripeptides of β-amino acids containing sulfur. Of interest are his works on the stereochemistry of chloramphenicol, β-nor-pseudo-ephedrine and a series of β-propiothiolactones and poly-propiothiolactones. The absolute configuration of chloramphenicol was determined by the synthesis of natural antibiotic from D-serine. Attempts to prepare mercaptochloramphenicol in which -CH2OH group was substituted with -CH2SH, has shown that S-benzyl-N-phthaloyl-L-cysteinyl chloride with two moles of AlCl3 gave α-phthalimido-β-propiothiolactone, while with 1 mole of AlCl3 poly(N-phthaloyl-cysteine) was obtained. The synthesis of 15,15′-dihydro-β-carotene in 1960 was of considerable interest, since at that time it was considered that this compound during the synthesis undergoes a double allylic shift, thus being rear-ranged to 7,7′-dihydro-β-carotene. The synthesis performed in PLIVA was the first successful synthetic preparation of 15,15′-dihydro-β-carotene. The academic year 1957/58 he spent as a fellow of Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in Urbana, III., working with Professor Roger Adams on the configuration of C1 and C8 atoms of pyrrolizidine moieties of Senecio alkaloids. The configuration was determined by chemical interconversion of optically active compounds of known configuration by means of stereospecific reactions. Soon after he returned from the University of Illinois, Urbana, he became engaged in the organization of development of petrochemical industry in Zagreb. As newly appointed Research Director of OKI he organized the first modern equipped research institute actively engaged in the development of new polymeric material and petrochemicals of commercial interest. Research activities were mostly devoted to the synthesis and stereochemistry of optically active and specialty polymers like polyamides, substituted butadienes, β-substituted styrenes and propiothiolactones. Of interest is to mention his contributions to the studies of the mechanism of alternating copolymerization of donor-acceptor monomers which form charge-transfer complexes. On the bases of a large number of alternating copolymerizations described in published papers and reviews, it was found that the values of complexation constants do not depend on steric factors, while the rates of complexation are significantly dependent on steric factors. It was further found that alternating copolymerization via the charge-transfer monomer copolymerization, follows the concerted mechanism under the simultaneous crosspropagation of monomers and addition of complexes during the propagation. The work which is still under investigation is a synthesis of crosslinked polymers and copolymers which contain selectively imprinted regions. As visiting professor he presented lectures at the University of Merseburg, in Max Planck Institute in Mainz, University of Ann Arbour, Michigan, University of Arizona, and as lecturer he participated in Summer Schools on Optically Active Polymers at Forge-les-Eaux in France. During the summer periods of 1980 and 1990 he participated as lecturer in Summer Schools on Polymers, NATO Institute of Science, Tirrenia, Italy. With his coworkers he presented a large number of plenary lectures and reports on various IUPAC Symposia: Madrid, Budapest, Amhest, Mainz, Helsinki, Strasbourgh, Paris, Louvain, Bruxelles, and in 1977 he presented an introductory lecture concerning the mechanism of alternating copolymerization at the Gordon Conference in New London, NH. He also participated as lecturer at the international conferences on development of petrochemistry in Baghdad and Abu Dhabi. He spent his entire professional life in industrial organizations: PLIVA, OKI, INA where he worked as production engineer, research director and finally as member of management board until the retirement in 1985. At the same time he was full professor (h.c.) at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Matematics, University of Zagreb, for many years teaching courses of stereochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry in graduate and postgraduate studies. He was one of initiators of the organization of postgraduate courses in the field of macromolecular science in Zagreb. With his coworkers he published more than 200 scientific papers, mostly in leading international journals, 70 professional and review articles, 31 patents and more than 100 scientific and review articles published in proceedings of international and domestic conferences and symposia. Studies on synthesis and stereochemistry of polymers which are of interest as new materials in technical fields, specially as materials of importance in petroleum and petrochemical industry, are continued after the retirement through the collaboration with scientists from INA. Summary of some important research and development results: -Spectroscopic and toxicological proof of the existence of cis-trans isomers of 3,3′- diamino-4,4′-dihidroxy arsenobenzene. - Total synthesis of β-carotene and 15,15′-dihydro-β-carotene. - Synthesis of optically active sulfur containing L-β-aminoacids. - Configuration of β-nor-pseudo-ephedrine, chloramphenicol and β-propiothiolactones. - Configuration of C1- and C8-atoms of monocrotaline. - Contribution to the development of petrochemical industry and specially to the development of macromolecular science. - Studies in the synthesis and characterization of optically active polymers. - Preparation of alternating copolymers formed through the participation of charge-transfer complexes.",Amino acids; Benzene; Charge transfer; Copolymerization; Drug products; Petrochemicals; Polyamides; Spectroscopic analysis; Stereochemistry; Synthesis (chemical); Technical presentations; Petrochemistry; Chemical engineering

Current opinion among researchers indicates that the obesogen theory is very likely; however, limited published studies show inconsistent support for the obesogenic effects of most substances in children and are limited by difficulty in providing the exact mechanisms of action, nor is their mutual effect in humans known, let alone in children. Existing data indicate that we have only scratched the surface and have much more to learn about obesogens. Hopefully, in the future, more information will provide an opportunity for policy makers to take action and protect public health. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA
